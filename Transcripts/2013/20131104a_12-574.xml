            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="108004">We will hear argument first this morning in Case 12-574, Walden v. Fiore.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.170" offset="136634">Mr. Bucholtz.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_s_bucholtz" startTime="8.354" stopTime="65.025">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey S. Bucholtz</label>
            <text syncTime="8.354" offset="141336">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="10.856" offset="151367">In holding that the -- in holding that respondents could bring this Bivens lawsuit against Officer Anthony Walden in Nevada, the Ninth Circuit made two errors that independently require a reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.829" offset="191282">First, as to personal jurisdiction, the Ninth Circuit held that it was sufficient that respondents have connections to Nevada, and that Officer Walden allegedly targeted his conduct at them, knowing of their contacts with Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.637" offset="238512">That plaintiff-centered approach is inconsistent with this Court's precedence which emphasize that the defendant himself must have meaningful contacts with the forum State.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.641" offset="270486">Second, as to venue, the Ninth Circuit relied on the fact that the respondents felt in Nevada the effects of Officer Walden's alleged conduct in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.849" offset="311341">That similarly Plaintiff-centered approach is in conflict with the text of the venue statute, 1391(b)(2) which focuses on where the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, not where the impact of those events or omissions may be felt.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="65.025" stopTime="69.310">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="65.025" offset="368079">Do you have any preference as to which of those errors you would like us to rely on?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_s_bucholtz" startTime="69.310" stopTime="124.397">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey S. Bucholtz</label>
            <text syncTime="69.310" offset="385215">Well, Justice Scalia, I think for the reasons set out in the Federal Law Enforcement Officers' amicus brief, which I will try to explain, I think that it would be preferable for the Court to address personal jurisdiction and not just venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.904" offset="439550">That the reason is that venue in removed cases works differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.439" offset="453656">There really is no venue per se in removed cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.974" offset="463896">And so if the Court only reaches venue here and holds that venue is improper, in theory, and maybe there are limitations problems with this, but in theory, the plaintiffs could refile the same lawsuit in State court in Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.949" offset="511753">It would be a Bivens lawsuit; it would arise under Federal law so we would remove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.400" offset="525545">But then removal would mean under 1441(a) venue would be proper per se in the district of removal, because that's the way removal works, and this Court so held in Policia half a century ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.541" offset="570162">And then there would be no personal jurisdiction and then the personal jurisdiction would be under the Ninth Circuit's decision and we'd be back exactly where we are now.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="124.397" stopTime="136.472">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="124.397" offset="605584">Of course, the venue question does not -- does not bring into the Court a constitutional question and the jurisdictional -- the jurisdictional one does.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_s_bucholtz" startTime="136.472" stopTime="137.555">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey S. Bucholtz</label>
            <text syncTime="136.472" offset="653859">That's true.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="antonin_scalia" startTime="137.555" stopTime="140.341">
            <label>Justice Antonin Scalia</label>
            <text syncTime="137.555" offset="658143">And we usually try to avoid constitutional questions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jeffrey_s_bucholtz" startTime="140.341" stopTime="193.042">
            <label>Mr. Jeffrey S. Bucholtz</label>
            <text syncTime="140.341" offset="669323">That's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.841" offset="671308">And the avoidance canon is certainly one factor the Court could take into account in deciding which issue to reach or which issues to reach or in what order.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.160" offset="696595">On the other hand, the personal jurisdiction question is -- is a constitutional question, but it's not a constitutional question in the strong sense of the term, because the only reason that the -- the personal jurisdiction question, as applied in this case, is a constitutional one is because Congress hasn't provided for nationwide service of process for Bivens claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.939" offset="763677">And as the Court pointed out in Omni Capital that Congress has the power to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.593" offset="782277">It's not for the Court to do that on its own, to fill a perceived policy gap in personal jurisdiction law.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.580" offset="806309">And so even though it is a constitutional question as currently configured, if Congress thought that it were a problem to apply the existing personal jurisdiction jurisprudence to Bivens claims and wanted to provide for nationwide service of process based on the idea that what counts is contacts with the U.S. as a whole as opposed to any particular State.</text>

            <text syncTime="202.647" offset="918531">I think Bivens claims, for the reason that Your Honor just stated, is -- is sort of the last place that -- that anyone should start to create a more plaintiff-friendly version of personal jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.073" offset="972239">You -- you would not have any problem about -- assuming we agree with you that it's -- there's no personal jurisdiction, it's the wrong venue, for the district court in Nevada to transfer the case to the Federal district court in Georgia?</text>

            <text syncTime="235.785" offset="1051129">Well, I think, Justice Ginsburg, in the ordinary course in a -- in a case starting in district court under Section 1631 or -- or the venue statute, that would be an appropriate course.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.342" offset="1093343">Here the district court asked respondents specifically, if I agree with Officer Walden on personal jurisdiction or venue, do you want me to transfer or do you want me to dismiss?</text>
            <text syncTime="255.448" offset="1129705">Because the statute gives the district court discretion and -- and says in the interest of justice, transfer is -- is permissible in lieu of dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.202" offset="1156768">The respondents said emphatically, we don't want you to transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.821" offset="1167217">We want you to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.173" offset="1172651">I guess they -- they decided they would rather have an appeal to the Ninth Circuit and take their -- their chances with -- with an appeal, then pursue the case in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.112" offset="1208386">So I think under the unusual--</text>

            <text syncTime="276.496" offset="1213924">That's probably -- it turned out to be a good -- good strategy, at least to the extent they got to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.397" offset="1229493">Isn't Calder against Jones in considerable tension with your proposition that you don't look to the plaintiff's contacts with the forum?</text>

            <text syncTime="289.971" offset="1267841">--I don't think so, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.238" offset="1272856">I think there -- there is definitely some language in Calder that could be read in a variety of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.025" offset="1296053">I think the key language in Calder -- excuse me -- as the Court states its conclusions, it says:</text>
            <text syncTime="302.346" offset="1317369">"In sum, California was the focal point both of the article and of the harm suffered by the plaintiffs. "</text>
            <text syncTime="308.767" offset="1342969">And then the Court later says that -- that the defendants expressly aimed their conduct at California.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.487" offset="1365852">It doesn't say at the plaintiff, who happened to be in California; it says at California.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.622" offset="1378391">And I think that's not an accident that the Court used those formulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.990" offset="1391870">In all of the personal jurisdiction cases before Calder and since, and for that matter decided the same day, in Keeton, decided the same day as Calder, the Court has emphasized that random, attenuated, and fortuitous contacts with the forum State are in sufficient and that in particular contacts between the defendant and the -- and the forum that are created by the unilateral activity of the plaintiff are not sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.696" offset="1518721">I think what the Court meant, Justice Alito, is that the article was distributed in California and California was by far the largest market for the National Enquirer.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.717" offset="1550799">The article recounted events or -- or alleged events, that happened in California.</text>

            <text syncTime="1230.828" offset="5031250">And so I think it is significant that they did travel to the State of Georgia and I think it shows how broad the Ninth Circuit ruling really is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.700" offset="5066776">As far as law engagement officers, though, Federal, State or local, this is a really problematic decision because they interact with travelers from all 50 States and beyond on a daily basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.588" offset="6618345">The claim here -- the complaint states two complaints, Judge Berzon recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.806" offset="6635168">One is about the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.992" offset="6639870">It's exactly what you are describing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1637.127" offset="6656484">And those really are different as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.146" offset="6664530">I have a couple of citations to give you to explain how this legal process works.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.764" offset="6679054">What happens is the DEA seizes the money at the Atlanta Hartsfield Airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.566" offset="6698175">He takes the cash and turns it in to a locker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.268" offset="6709042">Then what happens is that we have to state a claim to the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.905" offset="6723566">And when we state a claim to the money, they either have to do one of two things: They have to give it back to us as a matter of law, or they have to start a forfeiture process as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.277" offset="6761078">And if you start the forfeiture process, you have to provide to the assistant U.S. attorney a factual basis for the forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.665" offset="6790649">And the way to look at this, I think, is the way that Justice Kagan's hypothetical asked, and that is imagine that there were two officers here, not one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.787" offset="6819070">Officer A -- we'll call him Walden -- is at the Atlanta Hartsfield Airport, and he seizes our money.</text>

            <text syncTime="1685.091" offset="6848327">We then state a claim to the money, and then we provide factual information about why it is that the money is not subject to seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.845" offset="6875286">They have to return it to us at that point or they have to start the forfeiture process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.482" offset="6893885">And when that second officer creates a false affidavit to start the forfeiture process, we are not in Georgia.</text>

            <text syncTime="2422.990" offset="9799955">There is a circularity here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.441" offset="9805702">But it's not entirely circular because we're talking about a specific State here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.393" offset="9821480">It's not that he knows that the plaintiffs might be -- live in Georgia or might live anywhere in the United States, it's a very specific State and that's why it's not circular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.332" offset="9853245">Now, if I could just help you understand our view that there are a lot more contacts between this tort and Nevada than in the great, great -- at least 90 percent of the cases the lower courts are confronting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.057" offset="9900161">So here are the points that I would make about those contexts, and there are six, and I will try and be brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.676" offset="9918655">The case involves money owned by Nevada residents, $30,000 of which originated in Nevada and all of which was on its way to Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.198" offset="9956794">Second, the defendant intentionally hurt the plaintiffs knowing that they would lose access to the money in Nevada, where they lived and worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.803" offset="9987201">Third, we will use documents in Nevada to prove that his action was intentional because it omitted the information that the defendant requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.243" offset="10024922">This is not a uni -- us unilaterally sending money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.861" offset="10035371">At the Atlanta airport, he said send us the proof that the funds are legitimate, that he requested and received from the plaintiffs in Nevada, and that he learned in searching a Nevada law enforcement database, which is paragraph 79 of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.669" offset="10086675">The two last points I would make is that the plaintiffs will show that they were deprived of the money in Nevada until the Nevada lawyer they had to hire used records in Nevada to persuade the government to send the money to Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.928" offset="10135681">And the plaintiffs in their case, of course, will show, because it is the fact that they are gamblers working in Las Vegas, that the economic injury occurred to them there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.832" offset="10167237">Now, if you think that's not enough, if you conclude that's not enough, you are closing the door absolutely to all of the internet cases, because those are cases where someone sits at the computer and targets someone in another State.</text>

            <text syncTime="3512.934" offset="14159687">But I think to -- to try to answer, Justice Sotomayor, your question and your question earlier about freezing a bank account in other kind of electronic cases or internet cases where different technologies are involved, maybe there's a difference between freezing a bank account in Nevada.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.193" offset="14216739">Maybe that can be said to be something that occurs in Nevada, that's reaching into Nevada to cause a real effect in Nevada, to cause something to happen in Nevada, which is different from seizing cash in Atlanta, knowing and failing to return it, knowing that the failure to return it is going to have an impact wherever the plaintiffs are, which presumably will include where they live, which is Nevada and California.</text>

            <text syncTime="3589.601" offset="14466365">On the other hand, the complaint only has a Fourth Amendment claim in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3595.255" offset="14488935">And the Fourth Amendment injury was complete upon the seizure -- upon the search and seizure which occurred in Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.826" offset="14515266">The quantum of damages wasn't known yet at that time because the plaintiffs didn't know whether they'd get the money back or when or what might happen in between.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.412" offset="14541597">But that Fourth Amendment injury occurred then and there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.014" offset="14552046">And so the fact that maybe their consequential damages are higher because they didn't have the use of the money for longer as opposed to shorter, I suppose that could increase their damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.203" offset="14588722">But it doesn't fundamentally change the nature of this case as one that has no meaningful connection between Officer Walden's conduct, all of which occurred in Atlanta and -- and Nevada.</text>
