            <text syncTime="813.270" offset="3359018">And again, we're talking about the 1974 to 1991 period, just to be clear, because since '91 appointees and employees alike are -- have the full range of ADEA rights and remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.492" offset="3403949">During that period, under 40s, as this Court held in Cline, that workers under the age of 40 simply were not part of the social ill that Congress aimed to redress.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.901" offset="3457552">They were concerned with the plight of the relatively older worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.520" offset="3472076">It's why the Court concluded in Cline that reverse discrimination is not covered and also the explanation for why Congress drew a line at age 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.793" offset="3505200">Just as in Smith, for example, the Education of the Handicapped Act didn't extend to cover all manner of hurdles confronted by a disabled student, it -- it focused solely on a singular issue facing, a curricular issue facing these students.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.405" offset="3571655">Undoubtedly, those students not covered by it would have retained their Section 1983 right.</text>

            <text syncTime="874.741" offset="3604987">Now, as to the -- the narrow exception that existed between '74 and '91 for high-level government policymakers, we have the EEOC's understanding of why exactly Congress did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.318" offset="3655247">They did so because there was concern on the part of members of Congress that it would be inappropriate from a matter of federalism and operationally to have Federal involvement in the hiring decisions made by the highest members, the elected members of State and local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.361" offset="3723479">And that concern applies equally to Section 1983 claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.932" offset="3745735">Because that concern applies equally -- we're not talking about people who weren't within the scope of the social ill; we're talking about a deliberate carveout for reasons that apply equally to Section 1983 -- we would submit that the exception likewise would have had force during that interim period.</text>

            <text syncTime="1016.917" offset="4173621">It's -- it's -- we know from past statutes like the Genetics Act that was passed more recently the way in which Congress would incorporate GERA by reference instead of vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.392" offset="4219596">We know that, for example, in that same 1991 Act, 1981(a) was added and provided punitive damages for a whole array of--</text>

            <text syncTime="1043.500" offset="4279991">But there are also real differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.902" offset="4285634">I mean, they're obvious -- they obviously cover different people; there are different procedural prerequisites for the suit; you get a different kind of review, you only get administrative review under the GERA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.743" offset="4332968">So it's a separate inquiry as to whether this statute that has some commonalities, some differences, displaces constitutional claims, and it's an inquiry that really has never been addressed in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.612" offset="5488416">Your Honor, to reiterate a point made just a few moments ago, I think that the proper resolution, if -- GERA and the ADEA, again, are really one remedial regime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.122" offset="5550483">And -- and I've -- I've pointed out 1981(a) as an example of a -- of a similar regime where punitive damages were added to a numbers of statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.061" offset="5582248">And yet if we considered any one of those statute today, we would agree that it includes punitive damages, even though it was added in a freestanding statute as part of the 1991 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.083" offset="5622372">But, again, I would say as a procedural matter, should the Court harbor concerns about this issue and wish to permit the claim that appointees and employees are entitled to different displacement rules and the counterargument that, no, they're not because GERA effectively amends and adds to the ADEA, the way to handle that procedurally would be to vacate the judgment below and to let the parties argue those points to that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.852" offset="5737415">As it stands, the Seventh Circuit was asked to issue a broad pronouncement that is indifferent to whether -- the Seventh Circuit was well aware and states that Mr. Levin was subject to an interlocutory determination that he was an appointee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.596" offset="5796347">And the court went on, and the only relevance that had in the court's analysis based on the way it was framed below is that, well, because appointees and people under 40 and other categories appear to be carved out -- and we have answers to all of those in our briefs in response -- but because all of them appear to be carved out, the ADEA does not displace ever as to appointees or employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.011" offset="5898016">That doesn't contemplate a new argument that as an -- as an appointee, rather, Mr. Levin has -- is subject to a different displacement rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="1491.186" offset="6070738">It was a sweeping ruling that was sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.802" offset="6081186">And the contention now is, well, perhaps the court should not have reached such a sweeping ruling.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.890" offset="12161552">The -- the State has argued since Mr. Levin has been excluded before the Seventh Circuit and before this Court, they used the terms “ exhaustion ”, “ not exhausting remedies ”, and they used the word “ avoids the scheme ”, “ they avoid the ADEA ”.</text>

            <text syncTime="3112.472" offset="12555897">--We believe, Your Honor, that those two cases are the second standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.357" offset="12575436">The Smith -- we agree with the standard in Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.575" offset="12588289">We agree in the standard with Fitzgerald.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.859" offset="12597379">And the standard in Smith, what that case was about was the Educational for All Handicapped Act, whether that Act precluded the use of 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the statutory claim, and whether it precluded 1983 constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.303" offset="12667178">And the Court in Smith v. Fitzgerald said that it did, because there was no -- the EHA, the remedies and the procedures there was not for a de novo review in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.946" offset="12717751">So the plaintiff's claim was precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.648" offset="12732589">We have no problem with the Smith standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.684" offset="12740739">But the Court also said in Smith that if there are matters that are offered to the children, the disability of the disabled children or their parents under the EHA that that doesn't cover, those things, if they're offered to parents and if they're offered in a discriminatory matter or denied for discrimination, those claims can be brought under the 1983 equal protection claims or under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the preexisting statutory claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.188" offset="12878770">So applying that to the ADA, there is no evidence that in passing the ADA for covered individuals that Congress intended to preclude the preexisting 1983 equal protection claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.133" offset="12946480">So our second standard in our brief is the Smith-Fitzgerald standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.771" offset="12969049">In Fitzgerald, the Court went further and explained if the rights and protections of the statute that is seeking precluding are different than the equal protection claim, then there is no preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.713" offset="13028818">And here, the rights and protections between the ADA and the equal protection through 1983 are vast, are vast.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.986" offset="13065911">There's different parties, different defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.771" offset="13077092">In the ADEA the entity is the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.640" offset="13088586">In equal protection 1983 it's individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.092" offset="13102378">In the ADEA, all these exemptions of people that aren't covered; if somebody pursues a 1983 equal protection claim, there is no exemptions of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.666" offset="13152638">So to conclude, Your Honor, we adopt the Smith standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3537.154" offset="14254587">Mr. Scodro, you are in a situation where the question is not whether the remedial scheme displaces a 1983 suit brought for a violation of the same statute that contains the remedial scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.378" offset="14303489">Instead, you have to argue that this remedial scheme displaces a preexisting statutory or constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.132" offset="14334522">And when we've had that situation in the past, we've looked to more than just the remedial scheme itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.721" offset="14360853">You know, Smith looks to the language of the statute, which refers to constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.373" offset="14383528">It looks for legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.392" offset="14391573">It looks to the coincidence between the statute -- the new statutory claim and the old constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.398" offset="14419577">And it seems to me that you don't have any of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.231" offset="14430966">All you have is a complicated remedial scheme, which would be enough to say, look, you can't bring 1983 suits to vindicate this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.821" offset="14477255">But seems as though it's not enough under our case law to repeal preexisting rights and remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="3600.494" offset="14507975">Your Honor, Smith -- as we understand Smith, and certainly as it's been read by Rancho Palos Verdes in Fitzgerald even, it stands for the proposition that the lodestar inquiry and I think word primary emphasis of that phrase may be used in Fitzgerald to describe the comprehensiveness of the regime as the first and most important inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.808" offset="14585193">After that, Smith makes clear that we are allowed to consider if there is a comprehensive regime, whether there is contrary evidence in the face of the legislative history, as there is, for example, for Title VII, not so for the ADEA.</text>
