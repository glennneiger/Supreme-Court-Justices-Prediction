            <text syncTime="2805.395" offset="11328811">The line drawn in Abood is sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.197" offset="11339992">It has the force of stare decisis behind it, it is completely consistent with this Court's First Amendment jurisprudence, and it requires affirmance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2823.856" offset="11402581">I think the key point, the key takeaway in this case, is that the context we are dealing with here is the government as proprietor and manager of its own operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.930" offset="11446885">And this Court's case law has said over and over again that in that context, two things follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.401" offset="11472798">First, the government's interest in the effective and efficient carrying out of its own operations is entitled to very substantial weight, more substantial weight than it would get if you were looking at the government as a sovereign regulating the citizenry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.993" offset="11527133">And second, yes, Justice Kennedy, indeed as Your Honors' opinion in Garcetti and Your Honors' opinion in Borough of Duryea recognized both times, the employees' First Amendment interests are diminished to the extent that the government has more latitude when the government can show that the obligation it is imposing is in furtherance of the government's legitimate interests as manager of its own operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3288.891" offset="13262708">That once the State has imposed a duty of fair representation, then everybody's got an incentive to free ride, whether you're a union supporter or not, because by operation of law, you're going to get the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.533" offset="13309311">It's just a classic logic of collective action problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.752" offset="13326238">And so the -- the fair share requirement really is content neutral in that it's -- it's designed to ensure that the union has the funds it needs to carry out the responsibilities that the State wants it to carry out and that that could be jeopardized by supporters as well as dissidents, deciding that they -- that they don't want to pay because they don't have to, because the law would get them the benefit of the duty of fair representation even if they didn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="3357.654" offset="13537830">And as I -- I said, I think the most important point here is that the line the Court drew in Abood and the line that has stood for 40 years is entirely consistent with the Court's First Amendment jurisprudence in the context of government as employer, not as regulator of sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.782" offset="13610346">Of course, if the government was acting as sovereign regulating the citizenry, an obligation of this kind would trigger the most exacting scrutiny.</text>

            <text syncTime="3416.339" offset="13772514">I suspect you're going to answer my question, so I want to focus it -- and I'm sorry to do this, but I think it's important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.160" offset="13799786">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.512" offset="13805219">I suspect you cannot answer my question about reliance without accepting one of the following three propositions: First, unlike every other employee, government employees have no right to organize.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.204" offset="13868018">Or second, they have a right to organize, but they cannot bargain about wages, working conditions and hours unlike any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.394" offset="13900723">That's the same as the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.344" offset="13904589">Or, third, the courts of the United States are going to fashion, using the First Amendment as their weapon, a new special labor law for government employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.268" offset="13948266">And I'd remind you we have some experience on that in the 1930s where courts tried to do something analogous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.022" offset="13975224">Now answer my question about reliance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3469.891" offset="13986718">I believe there -- the reliance interests here are insignificant if Abood is overruled because the result will simply be that employees cannot be forced to support union representation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3488.002" offset="14059234">--Because the union first would control their terms of their economic conditions of employment and have control of their relations with their employer, which creates a strong incentive for an employee to want to be on good terms with that union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.262" offset="14108240">And also, usually, the union gains employer assistance with becoming an exclusive or with retaining membership, such as access to facilities--</text>

            <text syncTime="3536.452" offset="14252958">So -- so you're essentially destroying not just the -- not just the -- the -- closed shop, but you're destroying the ability of the union to -- to get money even from the people who don't agree with what it's doing.</text>

            <label>Mr. William L. Messenger</label>
            <text syncTime="3549.410" offset="14304785">Well, two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.612" offset="14309592">First, exclusive representation, I submit, is not an impediment to gaining membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.564" offset="14325474">It helps the union gain voluntary support for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.431" offset="14336863">It's much easier for a union to ask people to support it if it has power over their terms of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.752" offset="14358179">So the free rider problem with an exclusive representative is actually less than it would be if the union was a voluntary organization, not as -- it doesn't make it worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.025" offset="14395273">I mean, there's a reason that unions seek exclusive representation in the Federal government, in the Postal Service and the nation's 24 right-to-work States because it's--</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="3580.047" offset="14427352">Mr. Messenger, do you doubt that these -- you said that there were no reliance interests, and -- and that's curious to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.433" offset="14448876">There must be thousands and thousands of contracts across the United States with fair share provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.253" offset="14472178">Do you doubt that these were core central provisions in the making of these contracts?</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.724" offset="14494121">That if these kinds of provisions were prohibited, the -- the agreements would look fundamentally different in many ways?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_l_messenger" startTime="3604.829" stopTime="3611.833">
            <label>Mr. William L. Messenger</label>
            <text syncTime="3604.829" offset="14526512">--The main difference is just the compulsory unionism clause in the agreement would be gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.066" offset="14547410">But otherwise, the agreements would be the same.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="3611.833" offset="14554516">You think that the union would -- would not ask for anything, would not have different -- you know, would not ask for different mechanisms in order to support its own activity?</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.724" offset="14598088">The unions go into these contracts with the understanding that this is what's going to enable them to at once satisfy their universal obligation to employees to fairly represent them and also, get the funds they need for administrative and other expenses.</text>

            <label>Mr. William L. Messenger</label>
            <text syncTime="3641.769" offset="14674261">I would submit that with compelled fees off the table, the union would actually have more leverage to get things for employees because the compelled fees clause is leveraged for the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.310" offset="14712400">Because that's something the employer -- or the union wants and that the employer doesn't care if it gives it away, because ultimately, that's money out of somebody else's pocket.</text>

            <label>Justice Elena Kagan</label>
            <text syncTime="3659.047" offset="14743329">So you think that if we just strike these provisions, in other words, the -- the contracts would have been negotiated in exactly the same way, nothing else would have changed?</text>

            <text syncTime="3674.426" offset="14804873">To the extent they'd be different, they'd be more in the favor of employees, because the employer wouldn't have that leverage over the union with respect to its demand for compulsory fees.</text>
