            <label>Mr. Charles J. Morris</label>
            <text syncTime="13.791" offset="158490">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.311" offset="172596">Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.108" offset="187852">At issue in this case is question of whether the general jurisdiction statutes confer upon the Federal District Court’s jurisdiction to enforce a system board award of an airline system board made pursuant to the Railway Labor Act, Section 204 of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.270" offset="308433">The facts may be very briefly stated, this is, in many respects, a very ordinary arbitration type case.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.800" offset="354617">There were six employees who were requested to work overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.388" offset="372903">They, for various reasons, which were stated in the arbitration or system board record, declined to work overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.460" offset="405191">They were then given a letter specifically asking them to further declining to work overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.400" offset="429014">They were given letters of suspension by the Company advising them that they were suspended, but were to report for an interview the following Monday morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.944" offset="471124">These events that I've just described occurred between Thursday and Saturday during the early part of April, 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.403" offset="508949">They then did report as requested but with a union representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.051" offset="531623">The union representative went into the interview room and requested an opportunity to be present at this interview and was denied that opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.069" offset="571643">The employees thereupon declined to present themselves if they were not permitted to have their union representative present whereupon that same day, they were given another letter advising that they were discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.854" offset="626813">This is the sum and substance basically of the case as presented to the arbitration board.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.614" offset="661817">I use that word “arbitration board,” I would be more correct to use the term “system board” because this is the term which is used by the Railway Labor Act and by the contract which we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.365" offset="704867">The matter went to the system board of arbitration which was set up pursuant to a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.846" offset="730781">The Board consisted of two members of the Company, two members from the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.503" offset="753351">They deadlocked and pursuant to the procedure set up under that contract, a neutral was brought in, appointed by the National Mediation Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.580" offset="797654">The neutral sat with the Board. Further hearings were held and in due time an award was rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.751" offset="822418">The award was joined in by the union members, not joined in by the company members.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.028" offset="839450">It constituted a majority award of the Board, finding that the company violated the contract by denying union representation and finding, based merely upon that, that the discharge was in violation of the contract, ordered the employees, reinstated and made whole as to their lost pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.047" offset="927535">The Company declined to abide by the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.721" offset="950209">It is paired from this record so I will mention it that various things happened rather promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.081" offset="975705">The company filed a case in state court to set aside the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.366" offset="996812">The union responded by filing a motion to -- filing a removal petition to federal court, but prior to doing so, filed the instance suit for enforcement of the award in Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.307" offset="1056580">This case turns on the complaint in as much as a motion to dismiss was filed simultaneous with a motion to remand the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.052" offset="1103600">The Federal District Court, facing his decision upon the Metcalf case which had just been determined by the Fifth Circuit, granted the motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and granted the motion to remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.363" offset="1160861">The -- I might add so I guess there has been a question, nothing has happened in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.375" offset="1180923">State court is simply waiting on the outcome here.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.358" offset="1204851">So much for the facts of the case; the -- perhaps the best statement, and we don't contest this of the rule of federal jurisdiction that we are concerned with, is contained in the Cardozo opinion in Gully versus First National Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.268" offset="1288443">We have no quarrel with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.243" offset="1296384">We call attention particularly to what I think is the crucial sentence there, that is the federal nature of the right to be established is decisive and therefore, I address myself to the federal nature of the right which we seek.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles J. Morris</label>
            <text syncTime="344.835" offset="1482689">This is the rule as I understand it, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.516" offset="1501393">I would ask the indulgence of the Court if you would look with me at our appendix in our brief because carrying us through the nature of this federal right means carrying us through the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.264" offset="1560430">And the statutes are somewhat tortuous and if they are tortuous, it is only because Congress, in enacting the provisions of the Railway Labor Act to be applicable to airlines, it sought and in my opinion succeeded in granting a coequal status to the enforcement procedures for airlines, coequal to what had previously been granted 10 years prior in 1926 to the railroad and to the railroad unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.975" offset="1679235">And I submit that it is a mere historical accident that the differences appear at the present time between the dispute settlement under the railway portion of that statute and the airline portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.447" offset="1741197">Both portions provide for two methods of dispute settlement in minor disputes and this will appear as we look at this, but I will mention it first.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.671" offset="1782053">The Railway Labor Act, as you know under the rail portion, sets up a National Railway Adjustment Board with various divisions, but it also sets up an optional contractual means whereby the parties can use system group or regional boards of adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.726" offset="1850284">This we will note specifically in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.608" offset="1861778">Under the air portion, for reasons which Mr. Dunau will go into in greater detail, Congress in 1936 simply provided that the National Mediation Board could, if it desired, set up a national board of adjustment applicable to the airline industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.127" offset="1935862">But also set up as a matter of compulsion and this is compulsory arbitration, make no mistake about it, set up a form of compulsory arbitration under Section 204, but also pointed out in Section 205 that in the event, the National Mediation Board did set up the airline national board of adjustment, then exactly the same option would apply to the airline industry as would have -- as presently applies to the railroad industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.842" offset="2058742">So, there was that congressional intent to create absolute coequality there, but as a matter of historical accident, we find two things -- three things to have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.422" offset="2109106">One, the railroads and their unions have preferred generally to use the national procedures; that is the formal procedure of the Railway Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.818" offset="2158634">Very few railroads and very few unions, although there are some and we know of three cited federal court cases all but one courts of first jurisdiction noting that such system boards do exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.629" offset="2213909">They do exist on the railroad, they are not common. On the other hand, the airlines have found the system board procedure to be quite satisfactory generally and there is no effort that anyone appears to be aware of to put into effect a national board of adjustment applicable to the airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.929" offset="2287052">But I give you this predicate by way of showing that there was not a congressional intent to create a difference between airlines and railroads, but rather both portions of the statute apply the same type of procedures and leave it more or less to the party, that's to -- and to the National Mediation Board I should say as to which will become predominant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.284" offset="6748557">This is an action to enforce an award issued by a system board of adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.734" offset="6778337">We have a right to be in a federal court with this action if in the words of 28 U.S.C. 1337 it's a civil action or proceeding arising under any law of Congress regulating commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.148" offset="6847927">As to any such action, 28 U.S.C. 1337 says you can get into a Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.248" offset="6884394">Our specific question then has to be When you seek enforcement of a system board award, are you presenting a claim which arises under federal law?</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.853" offset="6938833">And as to this decisive element, we are all in agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.712" offset="6962239">Petitioners, respondent, and the court below, all agree that federal law controls the enforceability of a system board award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.420" offset="7009050">In the words of the court below at the record page 4445, note 7, “Federal law governs the scope judicial review of an award made by a system board of adjustment under Section 184 of the Railway Labor Act since the application of state law to this question would allow a freedom of review incompatible with the purpose of the statute to allow the parties to arbitrate their dispute with finality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.541" offset="7149484">When I go to a federal court with a paper called complaint saying, “I have an award that I want enforced” and the judge says, “Why should I enforce it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.782" offset="7190549">I say, because the rail -- Congress through the Railway Labor Act as amplified by judicial interpretation has said that if I get an award, I am entitled to have it enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.880" offset="7242898">Therefore, I lay my claim for the enforcement of this award on federal law and laying my claim on federal law, I am squarely within the confines of the general jurisdictional statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1825.830" offset="7406738">But the problem, although you're quite right, the federal law governs, that this would only mean that the federal courts don't have jurisdictions, the federal law has to be applied to state court to prove any access to it if I believe so, does it?</text>

            <text syncTime="1837.409" offset="7453027">I think when we say we have a right to go into a federal court under the general jurisdictional statutes, we don't say that mean that -- there isn't concurrent jurisdiction in the state courts, but that is true whenever you can get into a Federal District Court by virtue of the general jurisdictional statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.796" offset="7522513">Now, the respondent says, “You're running too fast with this argument”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.496" offset="7537351">The respondent says, “A suit on an arbitration award is a suit on a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.186" offset="7560129">And therefore, you are not basing your action on the arbitration award, you're not basing it on the Railway Labor Act, you're basing it on the arbitration award on the contract.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.045" offset="7607568">You see that seems to me to be question begging, because whether I have a good action on this contract depends upon federal law, its Congress through the Railway Labor Act which has said, “Whether I have a good claim or a bad claim.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.196" offset="7672142">And because the law which provides efficacy to this contract claim of mine is federal law, that's what makes it a claim arising under the Railway Labor Act, an Act regulating commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.033" offset="7723551">Now, you take the same contention put somewhat differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.087" offset="7739747">The idea is expressed that here are six employee seeking reinstatement with back pay because of a wrongful discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.901" offset="7778931">Now, nothing in the Railway Labor Act confers a protection against wrongful of discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.238" offset="7804322">This is conferred only by agreement, so our action is not based on the Railway Labor Act or any protection conferred by it; it is instead based on the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.829" offset="7850715">But all this does, it seems to us, is to push the analysis back a few steps, but you come out of the same place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.336" offset="7880704">True, the contract gives us the underlying right and the parties would be free or not -- the parties are free as they choose to incorporate this right into the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.528" offset="7925530">But having incorporated the right into the contract, federal law says, “You shall create a system board of adjustment to decide any disputes over those promises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.073" offset="7971715">You cannot go any place but the system board to adjudicate those disputes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.595" offset="7993762">If that process eventuates in an award, federal law says that that award shall govern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.604" offset="8021765">So it seems to us that in the end, no matter where you begin, you come out with an award which we say is enforceable because the federal law gives us this right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2035.087" offset="8243702">Yes, for these reasons: whether we have a right to then have this award enforced depends upon whether we get this right from the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.972" offset="8295215">Whether we get this right from the Railway Labor Act, involves a construction of the Railway Labor Act?</text>

            <text syncTime="2076.513" offset="8409422">The federal law gives us the standard for the enforcement of an arbitration award rendered by a system board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.253" offset="8444426">That is a construction of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.905" offset="8458951">Federal law tells us whether in the particular circumstances, this award should be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.184" offset="8484133">That is an application of a federal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.119" offset="8495835">It seems to us therefore that in every meaningful sense of Schulz, this is really and substantially a controversy over the meaning and effect of a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.808" offset="8542647">Putting -- put it this way; suppose Texas were to say, “We don't think that award should be enforced which require the reinstatement of the employees particularly with a small employer because that involves personal service and that kind of personal contact that something which we find offensive as against public policy if it's compelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.372" offset="8628851">Well, Texas couldn't, for a moment, begin to have that kind of a command under the Railway Labor Act because we would say and it would be perfectly clear, this is in conflict with what Congress has provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.939" offset="8679111">Congress has said we can make such promises.</text>

            <text syncTime="2152.204" offset="8712234">Congress through the Railway Labor Act which gives us the underlying command here, and that underlying command being federal in nature, it seems to us, we are squarely within the general jurisdictional statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2261.643" offset="9149942">In other words, when we bring this paper into a federal court, the only law we are bringing in to support our claim is federal law as traditionally interpreted, the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.417" offset="9205008">Now, if we are right up to this point, it seems to us that what the posture of this case is, comes down to as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.779" offset="9250461">We can get into a Federal District Court by virtue of this general statutory grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.421" offset="9273031">We ca be thrown out of that Federal District Court only if there is something in the Railway Labor Act itself which says that though Congress in 1875 has said, “You can get into a Federal District Court with a federal claim,” Congress in 1936 in enacting the air part of the Railway Labor Act has pro tanto repealed that general jurisdictional grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.561" offset="9369579">Now, what is there that can reasonably be said in the Railway Labor Act, the air part to say that the general statutory grant which gives us our right to get into a Federal District Court has been impliedly repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.417" offset="9425063">Now, the basic argument which is made there comes to something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.008" offset="9447424">Congress in the air part has provided that when the National Mediation Board shall think it good and fit, it may setup a National Air Transport Adjustment Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="2537.494" offset="10253354">Now, here I think is a fit illustration for Mr. Justice Holmes' famous dictum, “A page of history is worth the volume of logic”, because when you look at the specific reasons that Congress setup his dual system, one can see quite readily that it has nothing to do with whether you should be in a federal court or in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.883" offset="10342902">The original draft of this bill provided as it now does in exact terms for the setting up of a National Air Transport Adjustment Board when the National Mediation Board shall see fit to do so, but it made no provision for obligatory creation of a system board.</text>

            <text syncTime="2607.222" offset="10532237">We, therefore, suggest if you don't think it's wise to set up a National Air Transport Adjustment Board now, that you require the parties to create an obligatory system, you make it -- you oblige the parties to create their own system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.829" offset="10594722">And so the parties were obliged then this suggestion was adopted, the parties were obliged to create their own system as the equivalent of the National Railroad Adjustment Board System and the National Air Transport Adjustment Board was not created, why, because Congress said and this appears in the committee reports, there were then no agreements on these air carrier properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.813" offset="10694614">There would be nothing for a National Air Transport Adjustment Board to do and Congress have said, wanted to save the money that would go into setting up a bureaucracy of a National Air Transport Adjustment Board until it was necessary to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.635" offset="10753964">Now if the reason for the deferral of setting up this National Air Transport Adjustment Board is economy-mindedness, certainly that is not a reason which shows that Congress intended to foreclose access to a Federal District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2708.842" offset="10938702">In other words, why don't you use the special provision for review for these limitations of the National Adjustment Board award in your favor?</text>

            <text syncTime="2727.660" offset="11014040">There are things in the sys -- in access to a Federal District Court under the rail part which would be favorable for example to a person seeking enforcement of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.984" offset="11055313">He can get his attorney's bills paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.539" offset="11065553">Now, he's not going to get his attorney's bills paid if you're in a federal court under the general jurisdictional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.758" offset="11090422">On the other hand, he's going to have to, if he's got a money award facing trial de novo on that, in our view, he's not going to have to do that if he can get into a Federal District Court through a system board which applies conclusiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.313" offset="11136606">So I think that you can argue that two ways and all we seek to show is that whatever the reason was for setting up a National Air Transport Adjustment Board and that is deferring its creation, it has nothing to do with Congress saying, “We wanted these questions of disputes over arbitration of awards not to be in a federal court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.369" offset="11224900">On the contrary, they didn't want to set it up at this point because they wanted to save money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.491" offset="11245380">They set up the national -- the system board as an equivalent of the National Railroad Adjustment Board at least in terms of getting a final and binding disposition or a way of disposing of these controversies and here, I would carry the argument at least to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.402" offset="11304939">Since there was supposed to be duality, both of these systems were supposed to be just as good as the other in resolving these disputes, if Congress said it wanted that these disputes to be in a Federal District Court when an award was issued by the National Railroad Adjustment Board, certainly carrier would argue that it was not a verse to have in the same kind of dispute in a Federal District Court when the award was rendered by a system board.</text>

            <text syncTime="3128.882" offset="12618898">I think that counsel is a little unfair to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.972" offset="12635303">I have practiced in both the state and federal courts rather ambidextrously for almost 30 years now and I think that the juries and the judges come out of just exactly the same factories.</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.717" offset="12698206">I don't think that it's quite fair to say that -- or I'll put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.755" offset="12722343">I suppose that the judges of the Supreme Court of Nebraska may go home and tell their wives that they are on the best court of the United States and I suppose members of this Court may say the same thing, but I think it's little unfair to say that the state courts were incompetent to enforce federal law when they do it everyday in day in and day out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.832" offset="12802696">Now, I have said that and I have that out of the way so let me argue the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.580" offset="12825684">This is nothing but a jurisdictional case and it is a simple action filed on a very brief complaint in a federal court asking that an award be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.027" offset="12891512">That's all it is and as I listen to the opposition, suppose this and suppose that and point out what might arise and what might not arise, I was wondering where in the complaint all of those points were raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.232" offset="12968312">If I am not mistaken, that the District Court of the United States, the jurisdiction is determined exclusively from the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.015" offset="13007391">I am not mistaken that it is a court of limited jurisdiction and that jurisdiction must appear on the face of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.425" offset="13049083">All in the world this complaint says is, that incompliance with article -- he calls it 204, I've always called it 184 because I work out in the United States Court annotated, it's at 204, the parties entered into a contract and the result of that contract, an award came about and the man wants to enforce the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.616" offset="13157857">It does not say that he, the plaintiff in this case, has a right given to him by 184.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.754" offset="13194428">It doesn't say that there is a right there that was denied by this contract or by this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.785" offset="13226506">It simply says that he has a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.740" offset="13242284">He doesn't claim that 184 says that Mr. Cornstubble is entitled to have his job back.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.958" offset="13275199">He says that there's no award, it says that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.015" offset="13287424">Now, I say he says true that the contract was ordered by Congress that we should enter into the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.566" offset="13329638">In a sense, any contract action arising under the Constitution of the United States because I think we're still free men and we still have the right to enter into contracts and if you carry the argument to its complete absurdity, then any action to recover on the contract is an action arising under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.233" offset="13424306">It says, “I have the right given by the Constitution to enter into a contract,” but you do not get the jurisdiction in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.243" offset="13460355">You do not get the Court of a limited jurisdiction simply because somewhere in all of this there is a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.305" offset="13500583">The counts of argument would be of real sound to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.070" offset="13515630">It would sound to me well.</text>
