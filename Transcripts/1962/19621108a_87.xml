            <label>Mr. Edwin Pearce</label>
            <text syncTime="14.937" offset="163088">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.434" offset="181060">The Court yesterday expressed interest in three areas and I think in view of my limited time I'd rather confine myself to those three areas that were mentioned and I will do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.454" offset="229230">The areas to which I referred to a question of all, Mr. Justice Brennan expressed an interest in discussion of the Ledbetter case and I believe Mr. Justice Harlan expressed an interest in the writ of prohibition as a remedy and I believe Mr. Justice Goldberg expressed an interest in the possible adjudication through a contempt procedure of this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.626" offset="309896">The Ledbetter case perhaps is best the starting point for that, a case I'm sure is committed to the members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.087" offset="347721">It arose out of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.010" offset="359424">An ex parte injunction was granted on application of the plaintiff without any hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.748" offset="390353">A motion to dissolve was made by the defendant union.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.219" offset="404250">The motion was overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.267" offset="412400">The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed and it was brought here by certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.958" offset="431208">And the Court with a dissent, ruled that the case did not present sufficient finality to warrant it being decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.432" offset="493066">A thing or two about that case that I would like to mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.874" offset="506859">It of course came at the time when the courts were just beginning to feel the impact of the Section 7 and other rights guaranteed by the Taft-Hartley Act which I believe was in 1947 and I believe this case finally reached this Court in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.977" offset="583241">I suppose it was a trickle of new cases coming, but even at that time, the lawyers representing the unions realized that the temporary injunctive orders of the state courts were going to be used, at least in many areas, as an effective bar to exercise of these rights and for that reason that case was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.849" offset="674774">It was the argument made in that case as well as I can discern it from the opinion is that the case would be moot if it were not decided at that point and therefore, the petition would be without remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.347" offset="748753">There was an interesting thing said in that case, but I'm not sure what it means because I'm not familiar with Alabama procedure, but whatever it means, it's clearly furnishes a basis of distinction between that case and this case, the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.219" offset="816253">After stating that the case would become moot, the petition would be left without remedy, the Court said, “Well, we don't understand that to be a ground for enlarging our jurisdiction with respect to finality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="195.831" offset="886680">Then this statement was made, “Furthermore, the interlocutory decree could have been readily converted into a final decree, and the appeal could have proceeded without question as to the jurisdiction just as effectively and expeditiously as the appeal from the interlocutory injunction was pursued in this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="218.479" offset="977272">The statement I'm interested in is, “could have been readily converted into a final judgment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="224.907" offset="1002977">Now whether that refers to any procedure in Alabama by which the defendant without the consent of the opposite party could request and obtain a conversion of a temporary order into a final judgment or whether it has reference, as I think it does, to the more speedy procedure in Alabama to which I have been to some extent exposed and know that a final trial can be normally reached there within perhaps a few weeks.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.594" offset="1113736">Well, Mr. Pearce, I recall in my own practice in New Jersey in situations of this kind, it was possible for the defendant to consent the entry of a permanent injunction on the record on which the temporary order had issued and that's the way we used to avoid this.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.213" offset="1360227">The Court will say, “You can consent to a permanent injunction, but you consent then to the injunction, you may not then appeal it.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.293" offset="1384573">I mean, it's a consent to the injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.437" offset="1529083">Short of consenting to the injunction itself which falls into further complaint about it or appeal, you may not without consent of the actual party do anything to cause the temporary injunction be treated as a permanent injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.053" offset="1583626">So, whatever that phrase means in that, I know it means something proper, I mean, something that is true, but whatever it means either speed of court or procedure, we don't have it in Georgia and it is absolutely impossible to accomplish that and we didn't.</text>

            <text syncTime="599.537" offset="2501569">That, I would be glad, I know this is a point of interest and I would be glad to refer to the brief then but our state to this Court as a matter of law and as a matter of practicality in having them tried, this can't be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.671" offset="2554023">You either -- you can take your temporary order up as we did in this case but you can't ask that it be made permanent unless the other side will agree to it which the case then of course any order that you and the other lawyers agree to the Court will make.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.369" offset="2616822">And now I'm going to finish so I'm going to hurry a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.647" offset="2633958">Now in that case the question of mootness was made but it was at an early time.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.378" offset="2656841">Now when we -- this was -- this Ledbetter case was before the Garmon case and before the Garner case and Weber against the Anheuser-Busch, and the other cases in which the doctrine of preemption was announced by this Court as a jurisdictional doctrine, that is that the field is preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.841" offset="2734686">When those cases came along, we thought then this is our remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.851" offset="2754748">If the Supreme Court has announced that the state court is without jurisdiction in this field, certainly the state courts won't assert you.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.178" offset="2788080">And certainly if they do, we can have it reviewed by the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.243" offset="2812322">It took us 10 years and I've documented those 10 years to find out that two things for sure in Georgia now exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.634" offset="2845863">Number one, that the state court temporary injunction is a specific and effective antidote to the exercise of Section 7 powers and secondly, that the Georgia Supreme Court will not pay any attention to the preemption doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.789" offset="2918484">Those are documented by the cases in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.709" offset="2934157">Those two things exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.803" offset="2942621">This case came along and it's like the typical case.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.765" offset="2962474">It infringed on the rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.034" offset="2971460">It had a meant -- a mention in the petition of a right -- a violation of a state right to work law.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.984" offset="3003329">The evidence showed that there was no substantial evidence introduced from which that could be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.950" offset="3023182">The trial court on the interlocutory injunction exercised here its discretion was persuaded but this case was so weak that he should not grant a temporary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.993" offset="3063306">For once, we went in the trial court, he said, “The injunction should not be granted”.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.318" offset="3084622">This was taken after the Georgia Supreme Court and they said the evidence demanded a finding of the injunction and sent it back and said, “You must enjoin this picket”, which is the strongest case I could ever get.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.883" offset="3138853">In other words, the man with the discretion said, “No injunction”.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.351" offset="3148779">The Supreme Court said, “This record demands an injunction”.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.732" offset="3162258">So now we brought it to this Court with two things that we want to point out that may be differ from the Ledbetter case.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.162" offset="3196008">Number one is Ledbetter case talked about mootness and talking about finality as a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.751" offset="3222340">I have tried to demonstrate that in this area, in this state, as a practical matter, the interlocutory injunction is found and denies your rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.904" offset="3287019">And I also point out that if in Alabama as this Court has said, the interlocutory injunction could have been readily converted into final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.107" offset="3331845">The case at bar from Georgia differs.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.045" offset="3343548">We cannot do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.661" offset="3350026">We are faced with a minimum of 12 months and the clerk was very conservative, he didn't much like the idea of publishing how slow we were, so he set a minimum of 12 months and we'll go on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.255" offset="3388374">Actually, it's about 18 in the normal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.173" offset="3404048">We have shown that that's how long it takes to get one to the final calendar and we've shown that in every case in the last 10 years not one has ever been tried, not one, 45 cases, I think I had 33 of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.479" offset="3465279">Not one could ever be made to go in a final trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="883.524" offset="3637478">It just can't be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.277" offset="3644479">If you -- if we can't get relief in the interlocutory hearing, Section 7 rights are not existing in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.784" offset="3678542">Now, we have made -- what I think it's a very good departure from that rule in Pope against Atlantic Coast Line, that was a case in which a resident of Georgia wanted to bring a demonstrator against the railroad under the Federal Employees Liability Act which gave him the right to bring it as a transit action in Georgia, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.623" offset="3761821">He brought it in Alabama because he was a resident of Georgia and because I -- the Courts had jurisdiction over his person.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.921" offset="3787107">The Court issued an order -- I mean, didn't issue an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.648" offset="3797974">They -- well, they did issue a temporary order, but rested on a petition to restrain him from prosecuting that case in Alabama which of course was depriving him of his right to bring cause of action under the Federal Employees Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.414" offset="3860982">The case actually came up and this came from Georgia and I'm therefore familiar with the practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.649" offset="3881984">This came up on something that is about as [Inaudible] as anything we held there really on demurrer.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.201" offset="3904136">The defendant demurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.622" offset="3909883">The trial court sustained it.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.478" offset="3917302">It was appealed to our Supreme Court and they overruled the order sustaining the demurrer which only said, “This petition states a cause of action and may be tried.”</text>
            <text syncTime="963.879" offset="3958888">That was appealed by the claimant to this Court as is on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.682" offset="3978115">This Court granted certiorari and to protect the right of bringing the suit under the Federal Employees Liability Act reversed and remanded, and said, that he had the right to bring the suit wherever he wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.204" offset="4036211">The important thing there is in the departure.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.971" offset="4043212">I won't call your attention as that comes up on demurrer here.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.663" offset="4058049">All the demurrer adjudicated was that the petition with all of its allegations that the claim was being brought in Alabama for fraudulent and vexatious and harassment purposes stated a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.420" offset="4105070">We don't know the extent of the fraud without any evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.911" offset="4114996">We don't know the extent of the harassment of the vexatious nature, but the Georgia Supreme Court said, “That sets out a cause of action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.838" offset="4150732">This Court said it does not and sent it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.235" offset="4164315">Now we've -- now have a question in that case of handling a review on demurrer which is, as early as you can get in Georgia, proposing now an order of how we try things and demurrer is the first thing you try then the police filed in the case on [Inaudible].</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.613" offset="4233801">That extension, every reason that came into that would be in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.406" offset="4248952">Of course it was obviously a bad thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.111" offset="4255848">This man couldn't bring his case for the years it took.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.877" offset="4270895">He might not have a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.964" offset="4275179">He might not have any witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.078" offset="4279672">He might not have the money to last to bringing the case there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.800" offset="4290539">Even the statute of limitations might run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.994" offset="4299316">I don't know what Alabama would say about a statute running when another court of another state had enjoined them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.032" offset="4319483">They might give him relief, they might not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.996" offset="4327320">So he was on a bad fix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.134" offset="4331917">He didn't have a relief then and not at all, but that's no different from the showing I have made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.551" offset="4349576">We have to have relief here or not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.436" offset="4369115">I ask you to look at the Pope case and I gave this citation yesterday and see if the departure I'm requesting is anymore adequate than the departure in the Pope case or there -- if any reasons in the Pope case that I wouldn't have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.460" offset="4421256">Now, rather quickly because of the time, Mr. Justice Harlan asked me about the use of a writ of prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.884" offset="4458872">I think that is settled sir by the case of Amalgamated Clothing Workers against Richman Brothers, 348 U.S. 511, in which a precise situation like this arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.008" offset="4515401">A petition in the state court to enjoin the picketing was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.594" offset="4533791">The union first tried to remove it to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.380" offset="4548942">That removal was denied and properly so by the federal court on the grounds that District Court didn't have jurisdiction, the Labor Board did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.034" offset="4575483">But with that pronouncement that the Labor Board had jurisdiction, they then made a motion to dismiss the case in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.849" offset="4598784">The state court overruled the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.829" offset="4606725">Then the petition was filed in the federal court by the union, the Federal District Court, asking that the state case be prohibited or enjoined and pending that and before hearing, the state court came out and granted the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.968" offset="4663254">The District Court refused to enjoin it, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.321" offset="4688645">Anyhow it reached this Court and certiorari was granted and this Court said that only the Labor Board, the National Labor Relations Board, could bring a petition in the federal court to enjoin the handling of prosecution of a state case, that a private party could not do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.246" offset="4760325">Now there were three dissents in that case and that case might be [Inaudible] examination that is 348 U.S. 511, but it's still -- it hasn't been touched by this Court since.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.170" offset="4820093">It's been followed by a number of Circuit Courts but this Court has not, as far as I know, made any further pronouncement on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.886" offset="4842872">So this Court has said that we cannot do -- take that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.495" offset="4865337">Now, getting to the request here, I'm not going too fast and I guess I'm not going fast enough if I [Inaudible], getting into Mr. Justice Goldberg's question, he asked me about the Georgia law I believe it's the [Inaudible] and hit me at the time I could have told you fairly accurately then what it was, I do have it now with citations and it is consistent with the general law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.411" offset="4956975">We are very positive down there that you have no right to violate an injunction simply because it's wrong and may later be reversed and they're rather tough in the enforcement of that, if I may add that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.878" offset="5006921">If however, the order is based on absolute -- I mean if the order is without jurisdiction over the subject matter, then it's a nullity, it's void and the contempt proceeding will be reversed upon recognition of the voidness of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.705" offset="5066167">I'm familiar with the case of Amalgamated Railway and Motor Coach Employees and United Gas Corp. and Chemical Workers case against the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, that's 340 U.S. 383 in which both case on the merits and the contempts hit the Court at the same time and they said that the Wisconsin Labor Board had no right to be operating in the field that the National Labor Relations Board had and reversed the whole thing, lock, stock and barrel, I suppose the contempts along with the case in Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.566" offset="5205661">There is one more case if you let me in my last minute add to that because this case is very close to my heart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.812" offset="5226663">It's a new case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.631" offset="5229902">It hasn't gotten in the books yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.280" offset="5236485">It's called In Re Green and it was decided in this Court on May the 21st of this year, and it's case Number 312, and it is reported in the Supreme Court Reporters at 82 Supreme Court Reporters 1114.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.807" offset="5302627">That was a case in which the lawyer advised the union to make a test case out of it was himself committed to jail on contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.093" offset="5343796">And he tried the rocky road of bail, habeas corpus, and finally reached this Court and got turned loose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.608" offset="5389772">But he got turned loose by a majority on the grounds that his constitutional rights to be heard were infringed upon because the judge in committing him wouldn't even let him tell why he did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.790" offset="5442539">There was a strong dissent from -- in the result but in the reason for the result by some members of this Court who would I think have kept his lawyer in jail except for the fact that he claimed, he had -- he advised this contempt after conference with the trial judge and opposing lawyer and all three of them agreed it would be alright to test it by contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.914" offset="5559045">The judge in committing him wouldn't let him make that statement at all and the minority decision of this Court was to the effect that if you have an agreement with the judge and the other lawyer, certainly the judge ought not to agree that you can make a test case and then puts you in jail for doing it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1395.038" offset="5683493">I suppose there are obvious facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.028" offset="5695509">First of all if we would advise our clients to do something that a lawyer maybe -- would be slowed to do particularly in Georgia where the courts have no patience with it, don't' want it done, and will file a pretty heavy penalty if you try to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.020" offset="5755486">Then assuming you're always faced with a parti -- with a case where you have put a little something about state law in there even though they're not going to prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.929" offset="5787042">Now, you've got to risk the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.640" offset="5793938">That's the -- the Court won't decide there's a little bit of state jurisdiction here and therefore he isn't quite without jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.315" offset="5816613">You've got to expose yourself to a jail sentence and the consequent perhaps it will also -- statute in your community that you achieved by such proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.448" offset="5861125">And maybe the lawyer together with his clients get under rather heavy sentences and all come up by certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.683" offset="5890069">Now, by way at home were not quite agreed on how to pronounce the word ‘certiorari granted'.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.367" offset="5908877">We all agree that perhaps the sweetest words in the English language in such a situation by your clients and yourself or have a jail sentence would be those two words but like all sweet things they come with not frequency and without certainty.</text>

            <text syncTime="2834.181" offset="11440044">For instance, the petitioner has filed a plea in abatement which is the method that we used in the state practice in Georgia in attacking questions of jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2939.278" offset="11860511">The only stipulation in this case is that, we stipulate that we purchased more than $50,000 worth of goods out of the State of Georgia.</text>

            <text syncTime="3041.744" offset="12270320">As a matter of fact that the hearing referred to by the petitioner in its brief before the Alderman of the City of Atlanta, we did at this time substantiate our opposition that we had not violated the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.224" offset="12316296">We did introduce evidence showing that we were paying a prevailing way or at least attempting to.</text>

            <text syncTime="3212.447" offset="12953161">And in the time remaining, I would like to point out to this Court that it's been almost 10 years ago to the date the Ledbetter case was recently argued in this Court in the October term of 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.476" offset="12997256">Since that decision to my knowledge, the Ledbetter case or the Montgomery case has not been attacked in this Court at least on the ground upon which it was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.426" offset="13041037">It still stands today as a decision of this Court interpreting the question of finality under Section 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.562" offset="13073638">Mr. Justice Frankfurter spoke in the Wilde case as counsel referred to it yesterday, the rule in the Montgomery case goes further than some antiquated rule of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.009" offset="13111359">This is not some strangling rule that this Court has applied in the past to defeat the merits of the case as it come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.898" offset="13146990">This is a sale route and as it -- as expressed in the Montgomery case and as expressed in the Wilde case, this is the WOW case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.417" offset="13177083">The real reason behind this rule is to prevent this Court's piecemeal interventions with state procedure before state procedure has reset the degree of finality that will give this Court's ruling some meaning and some substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.775" offset="13226506">If the Montgomery case is overturned, the practical effect of it in labor disputes and perhaps in other disputes -- in other types of disputes if this Court goes further is to make an academic blackboard out of this Court or sounding board so that when the case goes back down to final disposition in the trial court the decision of this Court might become entirely moot or unrelated for the eventual issues that come up in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.038" offset="13319502">Now, I think it's important that this Court understand one thing about counsel for petitioner in his able argument and able brief as pointed out that the practice in Fulton County in Georgia requires some 12 to 15 months for a final disposition of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.158" offset="13376031">This is not so in the remainder state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.232" offset="13388257">This Court is undoubtedly aware we do have a populous state in terms of county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.921" offset="13403094">We have about 159 of them and in my part of the state, this case would be disposed of in three months when it came back on a final hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.476" offset="13437262">The procedure differs of course due the complexity of calendars on various courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.153" offset="13455966">But I don't think this Court should reach any decision on whether or not Montgomery should be overruled because of the facts in Fulton County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.083" offset="13483656">Let's consider the entire state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3347.137" offset="13491911">In considering the entire state, on our practice and procedure to answer some questions that were posed earlier to counsel, when this case is returned to the trial court and I will readily concede that counsel for petitioner the minute this decree came there, came to me and asked to stipulate that a final order be entered and that the final hearing be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.437" offset="13565158">But having been spanked once by counsel on the $50,000 stipulation I agree with great caution his request and we did not agree to this and we intended to leave the matter for final disposition at the final hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.425" offset="13621060">The matter now stands on the trial docket in Fulton Superior Court for final hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.696" offset="13638196">And I -- as I've said previously, I don't intend to disillusion the Court that the facts involving the labor dispute are gelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.970" offset="13675290">There will be no change in the facts, not that I can readily concede, but there is one important point that remains that I spoke of a moment ago and that is the question of whether or not this contract with the City of Atlanta has been violated because the respondent in this case is actively engaged in a construction work the contentions of the petitioner throughout this case have placed to sought it applied on this reputation and we intend to see at the final hearing that the evidence is introduced which will demonstrate that we weren't in violation of our contract with the City of Atlanta.</text>

            <text syncTime="3831.951" offset="15431137">Now, I think really that the critical question here is, does the record show or do the facts show that this was either protected or prohibited activity because if it does, then I think the Supreme Court of Georgia has lost its jurisdiction under these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.764" offset="15486412">Now in the instant case, the petitioner cites to this Court and argued to the Supreme Court of Georgia that the reason for its -- that the reason it was protected activity that this was an effort on its part to disseminate to the public working conditions which were repugnant to the general working conditions in the Atlanta area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.934" offset="15567078">And they state that under Section 7 of the Act that this was a mutual aid or protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.141" offset="15591946">This is what they were seeking and that this conduct was protected and it is preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.647" offset="15609919">Now, these requires an additional review of the facts in this case and let's get back to the report I made a moment ago with the question of whether or not we violated our contract is paramount to determining whether or not the position these people take is correct or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.046" offset="15667597">Because their whole argument and their conduct is based on the fact that we violated our contract and they readily admitted in the Supreme Court of Georgia that if we had not violated our contract, this would not be protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3904.154" offset="15719946">If they would not have the right to picket and to carry signs saying that S. J. Curry &amp; Company had violated its contract with the City of Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.685" offset="15750144">So, I think it's very important that the Court considered critically and carefully the facts as brought up on the record and the same facts that the Supreme Court of Georgia had before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3921.214" offset="15788178">Now, counsel has in his reply brief have stated that the counsel for the respondent has cited cases in support of its position being with the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3930.100" offset="15823809">Well, this is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.638" offset="15829974">I find no cases of this Court dealing with this specific problem that we're talking about now, the cases cited by the petitioner, the series -- just for a moment, the Anheuser-Busch case and the American Tobacco Company case, the [Inaudible] case, the Garmon case, all of these cases demonstrate on their face that they were involved either with Section 7 or Section 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="3960.848" offset="15946794">Now, this case on its facts, I believe, does not show that there's been a violation or protective conduct under either Section 7 or 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.156" offset="15983992">The petitioner here went to City of Atlanta or first of all and went to this respondent on its jobsite and this is uncontradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.635" offset="16009906">They went to us on our jobsite in February, this job started in January of 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.193" offset="16032162">They came to us in a group of some 18 representatives and said, “We'd like for you to hire union people on this job.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.012" offset="16059434">This was refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.926" offset="16063091">The statement being made that we operated an open shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.374" offset="16072913">Thereafter, the petitioners begin a very concerted and lengthy activity of trying to persuade the City of Atlanta that we were violating the term of our contract by not paying that prevailing wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.304" offset="16116590">Now at the initial conference on February the 14th, no mention was made of asking us to raise any wage standard at least under the affidavits of the respondent they were not and as I read the affidavits they're not -- this is not contradicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.680" offset="16174059">The statements made at the jobsite were “hire union laborer” which we refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.011" offset="16191404">Thereafter, the petitioners began as I've stated a concerted activity to bring the City of Atlanta to the position of where it would come to the respondent or go to the respondent and say, you are violating a contract rate wage level.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.558" offset="16241560">This resulted in a meeting before the city alderman.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.078" offset="16251695">It resulted in meetings with the city attorney and eventually the City of Atlanta and all the petitioners that there was nothing they could legally do to make the respondent raise its wage level.</text>
            <text syncTime="4046.903" offset="16290983">Thereafter and very shortly thereafter, the respondent -- the petitioner placed the picket on our jobsite with picket signs as the record will reveal stating in substance that we jave violated the terms of our contract because we were not complying with the provision that required us to pay the prevailing wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.246" offset="16352319">Thereupon and this is also undisputed, thereupon, the jobsite came to virtually a standstill.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.757" offset="16378441">We lost all the union employees and as a virtue -- by virtue of that, nonunion employees were also put out of work and it's on these facts that the Supreme Court of Georgia said, “This is a violation of the right to work statute”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.115" offset="16423790">Now therein lies the activity of the petitioner that would be protected under the National Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4085.328" offset="16444688">This -- it must be born in that also, a stranger picketing, there is no relationship of the employee or the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4091.891" offset="16470915">There was no labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.349" offset="16476766">This is simply a stranger publicity picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.484" offset="16489305">While I recognize that this Court has said on many occasions that such picketing is protected if it's done on the mutual aid provision of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="4104.538" offset="16521488">In this case gentlemen, the Supreme Court of Georgia in reviewing a decision finds that this conduct was inconsistent with the right to work statute and as this case said in the Vogue case and in the Graham case out of Virginia, where the Supreme Court of the State finds and makes and draws a conclusion or inference from the record that the conduct was inconsistent with the right to work statutes for that particular state, then it might rightfully -- then it may rightfully enjoin that activity or conduct as being in violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.474" offset="16641233">Now, I submit as it was stated in the -- in the Ballen case out of Virginia that this picketing was something more than dissemination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.255" offset="16672371">If the petitioner had really been interested in disseminating to the general public as it states that it was a question of violation of contract, why didn't it pick a medium of expression which would not have resulted in job interruption, the deprivation of work, and the interruption of delivering materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.594" offset="16737782">This job cycle is isolated from Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.582" offset="16745723">They picked a method of picketing which they knew would bring economic pressure to bear upon the respondent and in compliance with the original statement made at the jobsite on February 14th the Supreme Court of Georgia concluded that this was activity calculated to violate the right to work statutes of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.081" offset="16815731">It is our position here, it was our position to the Supreme Court that the record amply demonstrates that what this petitioner was asking was the enforcement of provisions which would violate the statutes of our state, relative – of our state, relative to the right to work and it to be gainfully employed, and to carry on an occupation (Inaudible) without interference.</text>

            <text syncTime="4239.552" offset="17061595">That is there was no attempt - there was no attempt to force a union contract here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.893" offset="17078941">There was no attempt to make any move or there was no unfair labor practice involved here in the sense of Section 8.</text>

            <text syncTime="4277.956" offset="17215195">I don't think that there's any activity here, may it please Mr. Justice Goldberg, which was prohibited in the sense of the Act.</text>
