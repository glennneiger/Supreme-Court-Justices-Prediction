            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 58, Rudolph Lombard et al, Petitioner, versus Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.638" offset="193912">Mr. Nelson.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="23.938" stopTime="148.562">
            <label>Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="23.938" offset="199137">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.451" offset="205197">May it please the Chief Justice and this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.649" offset="222020">Number 58 could be the titled the second chapter to the Louisiana sit-in story.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.098" offset="247724">Since Mr. Garner in March of 1960, between that time and the time that Mr. Lombard was arrested in September of 1960, the State of Louisiana passed nine amendments to its criminal code specifically directed to its curbing the sit-in demonstrations which had so dramatically drawn the attention of the United States and the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.897" offset="342915">In fact in 1960 alone in the State of Louisiana, 35 Acts and four opposed constitutional amendments were passed by the legislature affecting the segregation of races.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.129" offset="391920">So this Court as a result to the Garner case is fully aware and familiar with the history of the segregation statutes that have been enacted in the State and the Government brief spells them out in details.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.130" offset="451897">The relevancy of this monumental number of segregation laws is an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.798" offset="482513">And also an issue in this case is the one fact that in September of 1960 there was no statute requiring segregation of races at a lunch counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.077" offset="523682">In fact in Louisiana, there's never been a statute requiring such separation of races at a lunch counter or in a restaurant.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.486" offset="553357">That also is an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.049" offset="567568">In this case, we have a classical example of how police officials can implement state policy, state tradition, state custom in such a way as to deprive American citizens at a lunch counter of their constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.282" offset="644472">In this case Your Honors, we are asking for a reversal from a conviction of a criminal mischief statute and a subsequent sentence of 60 days in jail and $350 fine a piece.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.696" offset="694105">Now the facts (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="148.562" offset="697657">Does Louisiana have an ordinary trespass statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="152.541" offset="713540">Trespass after warning?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="153.594" stopTime="703.998">
            <label>Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="153.594" offset="717720">It does.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.610" offset="725765">And it was amended in June -- I have a series of Acts which are referred the District Court to -- that trespass statute was amended to try to curb the sit-in demonstrations but in this case we're charged under criminal mischief statute which has all the ingredients of a trespass statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.338" offset="800684">Now as you have warning and if you refused to move from the part of the store you're in, then you commit a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.640" offset="829942">This in effect is a trespass type of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.670" offset="846033">But the facts in this case are simple, three Negroes and one white at 10:30 in the morning entered McCrory Store in Canal Street proceeded to a segregated white lunch counter, sat down and were told to move to a Negro counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.170" offset="904025">When they refused, the police were called by the manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.382" offset="920952">The police then instructed them to move in the presence of the manager and when they did not move they were subsequently arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.941" offset="951150">There was no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.864" offset="954807">It was orderly, dignified type of demonstration.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.683" offset="974137">Now, the evidence shows that the manager is the one that requested these people to move.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.805" offset="998588">Now with these facts, it seems to be that the consideration in this particular case is the clash of the First Amendment freedom of speech rights on one side and the property right of the owner on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.277" offset="1056475">However, there were two additional facts which the Supreme Court of the State of Louisiana completely ignored and the Attorney General of Louisiana in his brief for reasons of his own completely ignored and that was Exhibits Number 1 and 2, and I refer to Your Honors' attention to page 138 and 139 of this record because these two additional facts are extremely important in understanding an insight into the mind of the southern police law enforcement officer in the implementation of certain policy of racial separation of races.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.518" offset="1229406">It must be understood that this sit-in took place on September the third -- the 17th, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.745" offset="1254379">On September the 9th, 1960, there was another sit-in at Woolworth, a half block away.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.375" offset="1284890">The day after the first sit-in the Chief of Police issued a statement which was highly publicized on radio, TV, and newspaper and is listed as Exhibit Number 2 on page 139.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.544" offset="1337553">Now, the Chief of Police stated -- referred to this sit-in at Woolworth as a regrettable incident caused by few misguided youths and the statement is directed specifically to storeowners, constituents and Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.097" offset="1415711">The important part about the Chief of Police statement is on page 140 in the middle of the page in which he says, “With the exercise of continued responsible law abiding conduct by all person, we see no reason for any change whatever in the normal good race relations that have traditionally existed in New Orleans”.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.132" offset="1511946">Now keep in mind, there was no statute requiring separation of races.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.810" offset="1534621">On down further, he says that, “The New Orleans' Police is prepared to take prompt and effective action against any person or group who disturb the peace on public or private property”.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.287" offset="1588537">Now four days later, the Mayor of the city of New Orleans also issued a highly publicized statement on page 138.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.845" offset="1630751">Now, this statement is to the point it's blocked and it can't be misunderstood.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.226" offset="1660322">He said, he directed the superintendent of police that not only with no sit-in demonstrations take place but he prohibited as he put it, so-called “peaceful picketing”, in sympathy with sit-in demonstrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.750" offset="1710373">He pointed out to the people what statutes were available for their use and the last paragraph on page 139, it is my determination, said the chief executive officer of the City of New Orleans, that the community interest, the public safety and the economic welfare of this city require that such demonstration ceased and that henceforth they be prohibited by the Police Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.835" offset="1814758">Keep in mind that there was no statute requiring separated lunch counters.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.089" offset="1839731">Now, the Mayor and the Chief are both subpoenaed and testified in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.619" offset="1857808">They both said, “We directed the people's attentions to sit-in of this particular type that was involved in this case”.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.091" offset="1895737">The Mayor of the City of New Orleans testified that there are thousands of eating places in the city and not one to his knowledge catered to both white and colored.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.383" offset="1932936">Now, these two facts changed the inquiry, I submit in this case, from one of a personal conflict of rights between a patron and a storeowner to the consideration of where does a person's freedom end and where does the state power begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.773" offset="2014438">But here in these statements I submit, we find a masterful piece of state deception.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.248" offset="2040351">It's addressed to men unlearned in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.902" offset="2054980">It appeals to community pride and the personal responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.920" offset="2079013">These statements and mandates and directives are addressed to storeowners, owners of private property, who should have the right of -- to makeup their own mind regardless of the custom.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.040" offset="2131571">But this message as I stated being clear, distinct in conducting, misunderstood in effect left a storeowner with no choice, left him without a choice of concurring in the action of consenting to service or allowing the Negro to approach the sit-in.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.900" offset="2210983">And so here, when the Supreme Court of State of Louisiana says that this was a free independent choice on the part of the storeowner he was referring to the type of choice which we usually have in the State, a choice between segregation or nothing just like the Saint Helena case.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.057" offset="2295620">They have a choice between open segregated schools or no schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.202" offset="2316204">The choice is always conditional.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.666" offset="2326026">In this case, the same choice was offered to the property owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.829" offset="2350686">Now, this message is a more sophisticated one than the average message gotten across in southern -- segregated communities in the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.715" offset="2394258">It's not a message to protect rights as to prevent the exercise of rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.431" offset="2413066">It's a rally and call to hold the ranks.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.616" offset="2425814">It's effort to keep public opinion from being changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.747" offset="2442324">And that was mentioned this morning by Mr. Moody.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.906" offset="2459042">He was reared and born in the South and so have I.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.633" offset="2473880">Never left Louisiana, born in Mississippi, can sympathize with the problem that's going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.568" offset="2501674">But I know this that the demonstrations that these Negroes have been going through is the only way that they can get their message across, the only way.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.324" offset="2548694">They know that southern eyes are closed and will not read placards.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.610" offset="2569801">They know that southern ears are deaf and will not listen to pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.085" offset="2587669">But they also know one thing that a southerner can feel something when you step on the other side of the line and it's that in which they communicate, that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.394" offset="2628942">It's that -- that's the utterance that they're getting across.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.010" offset="2643362">And that is responsible for the fact that because 3,000 of them are now under charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.591" offset="2665723">Yet, many, many more thousands have taken advantage of what these kids have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.845" offset="2686725">But I will get to that in a brief moment as to why I believe that the right of this particular type of demonstration, unique and new on the American scene is indispensable right at this particular time for the forward movement of Negroes in their quest for equal treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.948" offset="2787140">Now, to get back to the September 17th and the environment with -- within which this decision took place, the Mayor threw the full weight of the police force behind his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.770" offset="2834474">Now four days later, Mr. Barrett, the manager of McCrory Store, meekly told these kids to move to another counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.113" offset="2867806">In fact, the police officer testified Mr. Barrett asked me what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.175" offset="2900093">There was no question that Mr. Barrett -- he wanted them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.897" offset="2919006">And --</text>

            <text syncTime="710.878" offset="2946905">For the -- the Mr. Barrett -- Mr. Barrett asked the police officer, what he was supposed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.267" offset="2968430">What did the police officer say?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_p_nelson" startTime="717.914" stopTime="795.794">
            <label>Mr. John P. Nelson, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="717.914" offset="2975013">Well, the police officer testified that Mr. Barrett told me, “I want these kids out and what should I do about it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="726.971" offset="3011271">And the police officer then he -- then the police officer told him, “Well, you tell the kids to move in our presence because a misdemeanor would have to be committed in the presence of the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.431" offset="3057142">They don't need a warrant”.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.097" offset="3063724">But the point is there was no question but that Mr. Barrett wanted them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.223" offset="3080234">Mr. Barrett testified that his counters are segregated and they conform to state tradition policy and custom as interpreted by me, that's what he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.440" offset="3129135">Now on two occasions and I went out to ask him, well, supposed the tradition would be different, supposed the custom would be changed, would you allow the Negroes to sit there and the Court refused to let him answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.430" offset="3193083">So as far as we know, Mr. Barrett was conforming to state policy and I might point out, the state policy is referred to in the Garner case is -- was passed by the 1960's Act of Legislature and Act 630 in Reeds, it is the intention of the citizens of a sovereign state that a segregation policy be continued.</text>

            <text syncTime="948.857" offset="3898807">But we are dealing with a community, a neighborhood, a custom can be really strong in a full black area implemented by state action and you would have a choice five blocks away.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.866" offset="4118862">Well, no (Inaudible) -- my argument would not be predicated on state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.369" offset="4132864">My argument would be based on the fact that in the segregated southern communities when you are faced with as this Court referred a delicate and difficult -- of balance of the First Amendment rights, the freedom of speech and the property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.796" offset="4206529">I would say that, in these communities, in this day and age, a Negro who walks in and stands at a segregated counter should be free from arrest for standing there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.000" offset="4263372">And in the City of New Orleans as it is today as I know it and in that regard -- now this is not a question of state action, this is a question of a man opening his business to the public who gives up his right of privacy, who invites everybody in but yet, who intentionally, intentionally keeps this so where everybody can see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.944" offset="4363160">And this is -- you see, this is the thing that has upset the southern politicians, this pilgrimage of Negroes to the lunch counter, the high altar white supremacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.337" offset="4408717">It was referred to this morning as a symbol and it is a symbol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.898" offset="4422928">We in the south know what this symbol means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.399" offset="4436929">And when a Negro walks in and sits, he is demonstrating and dissenting to a custom which as you gentlemen has said, not be in decree in heaven will never change and it would never change, never without Court decision as far as I can see in the deep South.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.244" offset="4536299">But the point is that no one, no one who has ever lived in a real segregated community is so naive as to believe much less admit that when a city fathers give you these types of instructions of conforming with state tradition that a businessman has the will, the courage or resources to disobey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.387" offset="4644968">You just don't back City Hall in a deep southern community on this issue and get away with it.</text>
