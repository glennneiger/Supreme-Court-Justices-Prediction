            <text syncTime="464.430" offset="1961044">But our brief, I may say contains references and quotations from the recent testimony of higher officers in the Department of Defense before Congressional Committees where there's a continuing current theme that of the importance of a merchant marine and particularly of a domestic merchant marine whose ships would be available, local, and available.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.248" offset="2084342">15 a (3) added in 1958 provides that in a proceeding involving competition between carriers of different modes, the Commission in determining whether a rate is lower than a reasonable minimum rate shall consider the facts and circumstances attending the movement of traffic by the carrier or carriers to which the rate is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.462" offset="2165217">And then more specifically for this case, rates of a carrier shall not be held up to a particular level to protect the traffic of any other mode of transportation, giving due consideration to the objectives of the National Transportation Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.131" offset="2235852">Now, the Commission recognized the introductory prohibition against holding the rates of one carrier up to protect the rates of another mode.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.539" offset="2269497">But it felt that that introductory prohibition is qualified by the words giving due consideration to the objectives of the National Transportation Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.748" offset="2314324">It noted that that policy requires that the Act be administered not only so as to preserve and recognize the inherent advantages of the different modes but also to provide a national transportation system by water, highway and rail, adequate to meet the needs of the commerce of the United States, the postal service and the national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.730" offset="2414320">It took into account and I had just stated in response to Justice Goldberg's question that the Atlantic-Gulf coastal shipping trade had declined from 19 companies and 139 vessels just prior to World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.620" offset="2473880">The two deepwater common carriers, Sea-Land and Seatrain operating seven vessels in this trade and the Commission concluded that they represent an essential part of a national transportation system adequate to meet the needs of the commerce in the United States and the national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.187" offset="2540126">And instead of those objectives required, the maintenance of a differential relationship between the rail and the water rates which would enable the water carriers to maintain a rate structure which will enable them to continue economical and efficient coastal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.769" offset="2610448">Now, the Commission thought that the 10% differential rail over water which Sea-Land asked for was excessive but in ordering with TOFC rates cancelled, the Commission stated that in its judgment, new TOFC rates could be filed no lower than 6% above Sea-Land's rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.780" offset="2710444">And the Commission's order was without prejudice while the Commission did not prescribe minimum rates its order was without prejudice to the filing of new TOFC rates, 6% above the Sea-Land rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.480" offset="2765302">The three-judge court in its opinion decision held that the Commission should be enjoined from canceling TOFC rates which return at least fully distributed cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.326" offset="2836668">The Commission held that the requirement of a rate differential to protect the water carriers' continued existence, amounted to a holding up railroad rates to protect another mode in violation of Section 15a (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="697.700" offset="2894137">And it held that the evidence and findings did not support the Commission's conclusion that the National Transportation Policy required that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.050" offset="2931545">Now, the Court held that the National Defense Clause of the National Transportation Policy is not an operative policy factor but is a hope for objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.551" offset="2981595">And that in any event the Commission's reliance on the National Defense Clause was not supported by substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.189" offset="3020152">The heart of the Court's decision seems to be it's construction of Section 15a (3) as precluding the Commission from requiring rail rates differentially higher than water rates, even to preserve the water carriers from destruction, except where the rail rates are so low as to harm both the rail and water carriers as by a dissipation of the revenues of both or where the rail rates would deprive the water carriers of the inherent advantage of being the low cost mode.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.253" offset="3164348">So the basic question here posed by the decision below is whether the Section 15a (3) prohibits the Commission from setting aside selectively reduced, but fully compensatory rail rates to prevent the destruction of a competing and efficient coastalized water carrier industry, important for national defense and for the general public use, without regard to whether the water carriers are or are not the low cost mode of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.290" offset="3328502">Now, I have to clarify the issue as I hope I did in response to Justice White's question, it should be noted that the District Court enjoined the Commission from canceling all the rail TOFC rates which return at least the rail's fully distributed cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.614" offset="3405824">District Court's decision permits the Commission to require the cancellation of rail rates which return less than the rails' fully distributed cost, even though they returned more than their out-of-pocket cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="1378.423" offset="5617037">That would have come out altogether and it was provided that in determining whether a rate is a less than a minimum reasonable rate, and I quote, “The Commission shall not consider the effect such charge and the traffic of any other mode of transportation, or two, the relationship of such charge, the charge of any other mode of transportation; or three, whether such charge is lower than necessary to meet the competition of any automotive transportation.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1410.595" offset="5745768">And it's crystal clear, may it please the Court, that if the Congress had enacted the three shall not‘s and any of the several versions which were presented to it at different times, and at the same time eliminated from the National Transportation Policy, the provision of destructive competitive practices, then the position of the railroads and the court below and here would be completely justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.262" offset="5836466">With it, the most important thing about the legislative history is they didn't get the three shall not's and they didn't get the Destructive Competitive Practice Clause out of the National Transportation Policy Of course they supported it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.969" offset="5895293">It was opposed by the Commission and by the motor and water carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.336" offset="5912743">The railroad struck the position this, this will mean that the Commission cannot find unlawful or unreasonable or destructive any rate that covers our out-of-pocket costs, no matter what it does to any other mode of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.907" offset="5975019">The Commission pointed out that under that approach, the railroads would in many instances drive other forms of transportation out of business and that with the disappearance of competitors, the rates of the victors and such a struggle would not long remain on the depressed competitive basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.155" offset="6047953">Now, to compress that long a legislative history, by 1958, the Presidential Committee had withdrawn its support of the three shall not's, admitting that it went too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.389" offset="6100929">The Senate Committee said it went too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.466" offset="6113259">And so finally, the Senate Committee in 1958 reported the present version of Section 15a (3), they characterized it and since all this paid work really and this was done on the Senate Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.900" offset="6166967">I think it's important to note that they characterized it as designed to encourage competition in transportation by allowing each form of transportation subject to the Interstate Commerce Act, full opportunity to make rates reflecting the inherent advantages each has to offer with such rate-making being regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission to prevent unfair or destructive competitive practices as contemplated by the National Transportation Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.973" offset="6291310">Now, those expressed mood that the Commission should more consistently permit each mode to assert its inherent advantages whether they were cost or service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.579" offset="6337703">I say an expressed mood because it was a widespread agreement as to what the Commission had been doing prior to 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.106" offset="6367796">The railroad said the Commission had been engaging on what they called umbrella rate-making, holding their rates up artificially to protect the rates of competing modes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2049.762" offset="8302425">I'm appearing for Sea-Land Service Incorporated which was formerly known by the name Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation when the Commission's report below was written.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.088" offset="8355715">Since the early 1800's some years before the first railroad was constructed, there had been scheduled for hire coastal carriers in the United States, as the Commission found below, the coastal areas of the country have, to a substantial degree, been built about the availability of this low cost water service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.391" offset="8436903">Sea-Land has operated for about 30 years as had its sole remaining competitor in the coastwise trade, Seatrain Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.237" offset="8476296">Excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.956" offset="8479222">Present time, Seatrain operates five vessels in this trade, there's Atlantic Coast, and Atlantic-Gulf, and Sea-Land operates three as a total of eight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.202" offset="8524152">Also to complete the picture, although it has no particular relevance here, Sea-Land is now in the process of starting a service in the inter-coastal trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.587" offset="8565739">That is between New York on the one hand and Los Angeles and San Francisco on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.579" offset="8585697">There are two jumbo trailer ships in that service now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.748" offset="8602415">A third will be added at some future date, a fourth if possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.271" offset="8624462">I might say that the success of this service, we think, will depend largely on the outcome of this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.565" offset="8661661">Mr. Ginnane has describe the matter in which the Sea-Land break-bulk service was converted to a trailer ship and the fact that the Commission found that this was an economical service and resulted in substantial savings in cargo handling cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.983" offset="8735326">No sooner, however, had this new service been embarked upon than the railroad commenced a program of selective rate-cutting, aimed at the traffic of Sea-Land and Seatrain which unless restrained would have made those carriers completely noncompetitive and unable to continue in service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.827" offset="8814634">Railroads sought to do this by taking away the traditional differential and putting rates exactly the same as the water carrier rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.062" offset="8851623">The 66 rates involved here, they termed pilot rates have indicated that if they are successful here, they will of course extend this program to other areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2215.251" offset="8964368">Of course, all of these Sea-Land and Seatrain rates are competitive with the railroads and the reverse is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.826" offset="8994670">Now, after extensive hearings, the Commission found that with a spread of 6% in the rates, Sea-Land and Seatrain and the railroads would be able to participate in the available traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.848" offset="9046810">It was not a question here, if they're taking this traffic away from the railroads, they're merely putting the rates or allowing the rates to be in a relationship which will permit both modes to compete for the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.957" offset="9107205">Now, on the question of Mr. Justice Goldberg, we are convinced that for a number of reasons the water carriers would not be able to survive under this relative cost theory that has been espoused by the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.973" offset="9163316">In the first place, this Court found in United States or in New York versus United States, 331 U.S. 284, transportation cost finding is a highly complex and a very inexact science.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.107" offset="9219845">Cost planning entails many arbitrary assumptions of fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2287.266" offset="9252446">But even more important, however, cost finding is based upon factors of a variable and continually shifting nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.195" offset="9284106">The rail cost of transporting traffic from A to B will depend upon factors such as the amount of traffic hold in the return hall, the overall load factor, the type of equipment in use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.627" offset="9337919">The cost of the water carrier will depend upon factors such as the gateway ports through which the traffic moves, the cost of its connecting motor or rail carriers and the extended utilization of its vessels' load capacities.</text>

            <text syncTime="2347.729" offset="9494340">Now, this variability of the carrier cost was duly noted by the Commission in its report below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.039" offset="9519522">If during a particular study period, a water carrier were found to be the high cost carrier, then under the court's opinion, it would not be entitled to a differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.724" offset="9566229">It would lose traffic immediately to the railroads, its load factor would go down, it's unit cost up, and you'd have a vicious circle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2416.505" offset="9769357">It's probably more applicable, Your Honor, when you're comparing two different modes of transportation, but there is -- my remarks do go to the use of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.449" offset="9813138">Generally, I think costs have a very definite place, particularly to in deciding what the minimum level of a rate should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.709" offset="9846157">But when you try to set a complete rate system, a relative rate system of two modes based on relative costs, then I say it's a very, very poor standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.942" offset="9895163">Now, if the opinion of the court below has sustained the rail rates would -- which are competitive with the water carriers would all gravitate to levels reflecting no more than their fully distributed costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.709" offset="9950229">Now, Sea-Land's full cost, were say 3% under to the rail full cost on the whole, then the Sea-Land rates allowing for the necessary 6% differential would have necessity on the whole be lower than the Sea-Land full cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.361" offset="10016789">And of course, in this circumstance, Sea-Land could not in a long run survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.024" offset="10039463">Moreover, there's traffic moving by almost, it does not and cannot move at the full cost or anything close to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.395" offset="10068929">The Commission found that 30% of Sea-Land's traffic fell in this category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.130" offset="10091917">Now, Sea-Land would be precluded from sharing in this lower rated traffic because of its probable inability to assess rates sufficiently the above its full cost on other traffic if this lower court opinion is sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.156" offset="10151999">If Sea-Land is precluded from sharing at all lower rated traffic, why its traffic volume would fall down, it would not be able to fill its vessels to the extent necessary for a sound operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.877" offset="10210931">Now, a word about the commercial and economic importance of deported coastwise carriers, the court below said that the only economic importance of these carriers lies in the fact that their rates are cheaper than rail, if this advantage is taken away, their economic importance will disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.157" offset="10288044">We submit that this is an extremely short range view as the Commission found the economies of many areas are dependent upon or built about the availability of low cost water service, traffic moves between coastal areas that would not move if it did not have this low cost service because of market competition and other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.281" offset="10380518">Moreover, there's not the slightest doubt that if and when the railroads are successful enforcing what remains of this industry out of business, their rates between the coastal areas will go back to where they were before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.983" offset="10435271">They had this competition or rather they will reflect the same relative basis as the inland rates will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.949" offset="10467140">This propensity of the railroads was recognized in the debates leading with the Transportation Act of 1920 and the Transportation Act of 1958 as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.016" offset="10515414">As testified by countless shippers and water carrier application cases before the Commission, and it specifically recognized in the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, there is a very real need and demand on the part of the shipping public for deep water coastwise services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.845" offset="10586781">This extends far beyond a mere desire for immediate low cost transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.218" offset="10616247">On the defense aspect, I will just like to read from the first section, declaration of policy, the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, “It is necessary for the national defense to develop one of its foreign and domestic commerce that the United States of Merchant Marine sufficient to carry its domestic waterborne commerce, a substantial portion of the waterborne export and import commerce and so forth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.798" offset="10730559">In other words, that is just one of countless expressions by Congress of the defense on economic importance of domestic shipping.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.096" offset="10767757">We've shown in our brief the testimony before Congressional Committees by the deputy chief of naval operations, Admiral Sylvester to the unique defense importance of the coastal shipping in the advent of a nuclear attack, and also the special importance of this rapid cargo handling type of vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.808" offset="10858559">During World War II, as one example, a Seatrain vessel carried an entire division of armament to Montgomery and in Africa, and that was received quite of bit of publicity and the same thing could happen in the event of another war.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.179" offset="10932120">We don't see that as much more the Commission could have added on the defense aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.140" offset="10951973">It seems to me, it's extolling the defense virtues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.032" offset="10967542">It's more or less like extolling the virtues of motherhood and more or less unnecessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2732.702" offset="11034206">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.181" offset="11056044">As Your Honors have heard, the United States and the District Court joined with the Commission in the defense of the agency order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.634" offset="11101915">The Solicitor General is persuaded, however, in part upon the basis of the District Court's opinion that the Court correctly concluded that the Commission's order cannot stand at least upon its present foundations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.123" offset="11187911">United States is accordingly an appellant here only in a very limited sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.803" offset="11218631">We do question in one respect, and I shall come to that at the conclusion of my argument, the terms of the District Court's remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.148" offset="11271920">More broadly, however, we agree with the court below that a remand is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.946" offset="11307133">This is so in our view not merely because of questions which go to the adequacy of findings, though that is a significant aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.773" offset="11362513">One encounters here, we think, a more fundamental issue, namely whether the Commission has fairly construed and applied the essential statutory command which was written by Congress in the Section 15a (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.237" offset="11448299">Before getting to the statute, I think it's necessary to get a clear understanding of the rationale of the Commission's opinion for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.233" offset="11500335">Now, the facts of the case have already been stated and I would like that to reemphasize one or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.954" offset="11539205">All of the TOFC rates which are now an issue before the Court are concededly, fully compensatory rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.177" offset="11584031">That is to say rates which not only cover out-of-pocket costs, as that term is conventionally used but also overhead cost and their return.</text>

            <text syncTime="2994.546" offset="12081507">Now, we have here then a case in which the Commission has disapproved on the ground that it would be destructive competition, lower rates which on its own premise are fully remunerative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.238" offset="12160293">Now, the Act in many of its provisions and most notably in Section 15a (2), the paragraph immediately preceding the one we're talking about today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.467" offset="12213269">The Act in term seeks efficient railway transportation, this is a paraphrase of 15a (2), at the lowest cost consistent with the furnishing of such service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.924" offset="12275022">Now, of course, the reason that the Commission has said in this case that the railroads cannot reduce their rates even though the rates as reduced will be fully compensatory, if the reason for that is its concern with the two competing water carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.319" offset="12352658">The report points out that the proposed TOFC rates would bring the rail service down to the level of the existing water carrier rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.885" offset="12402918">If the latter water carriers failed to respond with the reduction of their own, they would, the Commission found lose business and as much as they suffer certain service disadvantages as you heard the less speed, the greater hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.460" offset="12477210">If on the other hand the Commission report states the water carriers reduced their rates to restore a price differential, then the Commission indicates there would be a dissipation of carrier revenues for both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.803" offset="12542621">The Commission then goes on to express a further concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.092" offset="12559757">It fears that the reductions and the counter-reductions will generate what it describes at record 29 and I quote it, “As a vicious cycle of rate-cutting,” the end result which then visualizes is the destruction of the water carrier service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.462" offset="12649200">And it is in this connection that the Commission goes on to say that it believes these Sea-Land and the Seatrain vessels serve an important roles from the standpoint of the national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.711" offset="12706252">Now, it's obvious, I think that this would be a very different case, if the railroads were here defending rates which were below their out-of-pocket costs or ever below their fully distributed costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.300" offset="12780544">Certainly, it is true that the railroads carry an impressively larger number of commodities and that they serve an infinitely greater number of points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.120" offset="12819832">It's true that if they could charge unreasonably low rates on some traffic, making it up on other segments for example, where there's hard competition, that they would be in a position by rate-cutting to kill off the competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="3216.734" offset="12970297">What we have rather is an attempt by the rail carriers to increase their volume by lowering their margin of profit, the kind of competition which is regarded by this Act, we think, and by the law generally as favored.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.514" offset="13045426">And perhaps, it's worth noting incidentally that a lowering of rates by regulated carriers does not necessarily lead to -- in a shrinking of revenues by the regulated carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.261" offset="13100387">Apart from the fact that lower rates presumably provide benefits to shippers which cannot be ignored, one must also take into account that one of the consequences of artificially high transportation charges by regulated carriers may be and indeed has been to stimulate a shift to private carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.212" offset="13192234">A Senate study on this subject show that in 1956, 21% of the traffic carried between cities, figured on a ten-mile basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.654" offset="13250017">In 1946, 21% of it was in the hands of exempt or unregulated carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.748" offset="13278333">In 1959, the figure had risen to 33% and that trend apparently continues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.779" offset="13306441">And Commissioner Freas in his dissent in this case refers to the tremendous emphasis given to private carriage by what he terms, “umbrella rate-making.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.342" offset="13364746">Well, since it's apparent then that the Commission's reference to destructive competition cannot lean on the facts of this case, cutting of rates below costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.414" offset="13409050">It must mean, I take it, one of two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.339" offset="13424724">First, the Commission was concerned as I've already indicated about the possibility of the downward spiral of reductions which would ultimately pull the rates below the level of full costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.706" offset="13478222">And certainly, one can understand this apprehension.</text>

            <text syncTime="3483.325" offset="14036720">Now, of course this is a great oversimplification because for some shippers, 2% or 3% less in rates may be enough to induce or maybe half of percent would be enough to induce them to patronize the cheaper carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="3547.445" offset="14293138">In terms of great competition, that would mean certainly that any rate that is above fully distributed cost by definition could not offend.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.165" offset="14340054">Now, I was addressing myself to this concern of the Commission that reduction might provoke counter-reduction and you might have a vicious cycle as the Commission said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.295" offset="14396583">It seems to me that this does not justify the Commission's invoking its minimum rate powers anticipatorily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.190" offset="14436080">Is it not indeed a sufficient answer to this suggestion, that in this very case, the District Court has sustained the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.508" offset="14481429">As to those proposed TOFC rates, rates which are not any longer an issue before this Court, which would have been below the level of the fully distributed costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.391" offset="14540988">And there's second piece as in the Commission's report I think and this lies at the heart of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.020" offset="14571499">It is that the water carrier should be given the benefit of a rate differential, so that they will get an assured share of the traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.645" offset="14609951">The Commission has found, it's been pointed out that the water carriers have certain service disadvantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.075" offset="14639626">The Commission then undertakes to remedy this by ordering the rail carriers to keep their TOFC rates no less than 6% above the level of the water carriers existing rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.204" offset="14696155">Now, I would stress that the Commission has not held either (a), that the water carriers have a cost advantage on the traffic in question or (b) that the rail reductions would prevent the water carriers from asserting or realizing the benefit of any such cost advantages they might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.629" offset="14797928">As to (a), the Commission found and I quote it, “We cannot determine on these records where the inherent advantages may lie as to any of the rates in issue".</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.509" offset="14849442">As to (b), it seems to me difficult to see how the reduced rail rates here in question could improperly impair the assertion of any cost advantage which the water carriers might have on this traffic, or is that already indicated if the rails or the high cost mode and if the rails are realizing more than their fully distributed cost on this traffic, then the water carriers obviously can reduce their rates and still receive a fully remunerative return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.732" offset="14986324">I think then one is necessarily forced to the conclusion that the Commission is seeking to achieve here what it regards as a fair division of the traffic and the maintenance of a stable relationship between these competing carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.206" offset="15048182">Indeed, if there's any doubt at all about, about this, I would say that it was completely disvalued by what the Commission says about boxcar, the rail boxcar rates as distinguished from TOFC rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.018" offset="15107427">Now, this part of the Commission's opinion is advisory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.661" offset="15117981">You don't have any boxcar rates before you in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.236" offset="15136266">But the Commission's report undertakes to tell the railroads what will be favorably considered in the future for boxcar service which also competes with this water carrier service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.095" offset="15187780">The Commission notes and this is in the record at 36 that boxcar transportation can be provided in many instances more cheaply than the water carrier transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.736" offset="15238353">Nonetheless, the Commission says, the rail boxcar service must also be pegged above the water carrier rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.646" offset="15269909">The reason given is that the boxcar service, like the TOFC service, though in lesser degree is more attractive to shippers than the water carrier service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.561" offset="15313586">Thus, the Commission concludes as to boxcar rates that the more attractive and the cheaper service must be performed at a higher rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.087" offset="15363741">And this, it would seem to me, is in terms to deny to a carrier the opportunity to assert its inherent advantages of cost and of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.934" offset="15411075">It appears to be doing with Senator Smathers of the Commerce Committee referred to when the bill that became 15a (3) was before the Congress, the Commission seems to be acting as a giant handicapper, fixing rate relationships in his terms so that each will share in the person nobody would drop out of the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.020" offset="15515460">It was that that the Commerce Committee said, the Commission was not to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="3875.387" offset="15604903">Now, in the form originally proposed, it's true that the bill would have absolutely forbidden the Commission without any qualification in determining whether a rate was below a reasonable minimum, would have forbidden the Commission even to consider the effect of that rate upon other modes of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.022" offset="15687450">The history reveals that this proposal was ultimately modified to meet the objection of the Commission among others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.307" offset="15716603">An objection voiced by its then chairman, Commissioner Freas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.444" offset="15737187">That the absolute prohibition might disable the Commission from dealing with rates which were predatory or destructive in the sense that they would undermine the inherent advantages of competing modes, rather than assert legitimately the advantages of the rate proponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.304" offset="15808554">And we have quoted in our brief, Commissioner Freas' statement and I'll just quote one sentence of it here because I think this is the essence of the point that he stated repeatedly to the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3938.971" offset="15859231">If he said, “We are required to accept the rates of the high cost carrier merely because they exceed its out-of-pocket costs, we see no way of preserving the inherent advantages of the low cost carrier.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.435" offset="15925164">In any event, that other mode would be compelled to depress its rates below full costs in order to preserve its inherent advantages against the high cost mode of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.440" offset="15981171">I was weary of the history, Congress in recognition of the fourth of this point changed the language ultimately to its present form.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.815" offset="16022653">Both the Senate and House Committee reports on the final bill, tell us and I'm quoting here the Senate report that the new provision was designed to encourage competition by allowing each form of transportation full opportunity to make rates reflecting the inherent advantages each has to offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4004.557" offset="16121605">And then the report goes on, such rate-making would be regulated by the I.C.C. to prevent unfair or destructive competitive practices as contemplated by the declaration of National Transportation Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.807" offset="16194644">Now, there's something further that's informative in the Committee reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.085" offset="16211675">Both the Congressional Committees expressed their complete approval of two decisions, one this Court's decision in the Shaffer Transportation case, the other in I.C.C. decision of 1945 in a case known as New Automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.440" offset="16277086">The specific language of the Shaffer to which the Committee reports referred is the language which states, and I'm quoting from the Court's opinion, “The ability of one mode of transportation to operate with a rate lower than the competing types of transportation is precisely the sort of inherent advantage that the congressional policy requires the Commission to recognize.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.998" offset="16399339">New Automobiles was the case in which the I.C.C. or at least though the committees of Congress thought had refused to hold up the rates of one type of carrier to protect another mode.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.348" offset="16456808">The Committee reports, expressed their concern that the Commission instead of adhering to that approach had backed away.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.443" offset="16493171">I think it's also suggestive that Commissioner Freas, who may well have been the most influential man in shaping this statutory provision to its ultimate form has dissented in the instant case on the expressed ground that the Commission has completely departed from the congressional directive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.975" offset="16591287">His dissent concludes and I think properly that the decision of the majority may well be taken to stand for the proposition that water carriers are ordinarily entitled to rate differentials regardless of the circumstances of the specific case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4141.379" offset="16668923">I do not read the statute to require as matter of law or even to permit blanket protection from reasonable competition for the water carriers, or for that matter for any mode of transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.428" offset="16733080">I might add that Judge Hincks extended the examination of the legislative history in the District Court, led him to the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.184" offset="16776129">I'm not suggesting for a moment that if the Commission were to find that the water carriers have a 6% cost advantage, that the Commission could not take steps to protect that 6% cost advantage at least when the point was reached when the railroads were lowering their rate so far that the water carriers could no longer maintain that 6% differential and obtain fully ruminative rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.233" offset="16908309">We don't have that premise to operate on in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4301.446" offset="17309132">We think that the District Court goes too far when it states that the national defense consideration is merely a hope for objective though truly it is at least that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.480" offset="17365243">And that it cannot in any circumstances be an operative policy from which a Commission order can draw a substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.218" offset="17416234">We believed that if there were a showing, for example, that the particular types of vessels operated by Seatrain had special characteristic, that these were relied upon by the defense establishment to perform a unique role in the case of the national emergency or a war, that this would be the kind of factor upon which the Commission could take into account in undertaking to keep Seatrain operating as a viable carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.284" offset="17544547">Now, we don't think here that Commission has any basis for saying that Seatrain is threatened with destruction because on its own findings as to costs, that conclusion does not follow.</text>

            <text syncTime="4475.713" offset="18006183">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4480.125" offset="18023842">If the Court pleases, I shall present the only argument on behalf of the appellee railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="4487.559" offset="18053622">And since the Government has set forth some of the positions that we wouldn't normally set forth in this case, I believe I can shorten my argument somewhat and perhaps save some of the Court's time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4500.891" offset="18106911">Now, the pricing controversy that's before this Court had been in continued existent for five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4508.475" offset="18137318">It began in 1957 and long as that may seem I would say that the background for this controversy goes back as far as the post-war, post World War II readjustment period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4524.532" offset="18201475">In the span of 15 years from 1948 to the present time, there has been dramatic and drastic changes in the transportation industry which has changed the whole economic role of this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.345" offset="18264795">And Mr. Ginnane and Mr. Spritzer referred to the Presidential Advisory Committee's report on, on transport policy, a study which is made by the so-called, Weeks Committee, headed by then Secretary of Commerce Weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4562.531" offset="18353507">Now, that committee made a very extensive study of the transportation industry and they found that as late as 1920, the transportation industry was a monopoly industry in which the railroad had a virtual monopoly of all the surface transportation with the exception of a small part which was along the inland waterways.</text>
            <text syncTime="4583.856" offset="18438771">However, the situation is completely changed and the Weeks Committee pointed out that the industry now has one of pervasive competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.286" offset="18476492">The Weeks Committee went on to say that a shipper, shipping freight between various points has available not only his own fleet of trucks but he has available a complete and widespread system of motor common carrier and motor contract carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.140" offset="18547963">In addition, he has a continental-wide integrated rail system, pipeline and he has a rapidly growing and expanding water carrier industry on the inland waterway, and not to mention a growing air transport industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4630.152" offset="18624031">Now, the Weeks Committee pointed out that while these changes had taken place in the transportation industry, that Government regulation had not kept pace with them and strangely enough was still reflecting monopolistic concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.138" offset="18691950">And as matter of fact regulation was being expanded in a period when competition in the industry was growing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4654.923" offset="18723088">And to remedy this situation, the Weeks Committee pointed that there is a need for a complete overhaul of the Interstate Commerce Act particularly in the field of inter-mode competitive rate-making.</text>
            <text syncTime="4668.921" offset="18779094">And they recommended legislation would permit a greater play of the forces of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4677.903" offset="18814934">Now after the Weeks Committee report came out in 1955, study committee then both the Senate and the House were formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.627" offset="18849834">Study committees of the Senate and House committees on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, and those study committees, principally in the Senate, held extensive hearings at which all people interested in the transportation industry testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.719" offset="18918275">And some very significant facts, facts which bear on the price and controversy here were developed in those hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.645" offset="18953906">Briefly, it was brought out that the transportation market as a whole was a growing one.</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.366" offset="18988805">But that the railroads' share of the market was rapidly declining.</text>
            <text syncTime="4726.317" offset="19008658">And by contrast the competitors run an entirely different situation, that their competitors -- that is the motor carriers, the water carriers and other freight carriers -- were not only realizing the growth of the transportation market, but were growing faster than the market by diverting traffic from the railroad.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl Helmetag, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="4751.525" offset="19109491">These hearings, sir, began right after the Weeks Committee report came out in 1955 and continued through 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.232" offset="19148257">And actually, the report of these subcommittee studies is found in the report of the Senate subcommittee which highlighted this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.743" offset="19202382">The subcommittee's report was entitled, “The Problems of the Railroads.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.284" offset="19220459">And after noting the decline of the railroad industry in the corresponding growth of the rail competitors, the subcommittee noted that the working capital of the railroad was in a dangerously low position, and that the railroad -- that this decline in the railroad was not occasioned by the recession that was then going on in the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.606" offset="19317844">Actually the sickness of the railroad industry were deepening the recession -- and eroding the nation's economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.377" offset="19356923">Now, the subcommittee, the Senate subcommittee recommended legislation to permit greater freedom of competitive forces in inter-mode pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.438" offset="19425155">Now, the reason for this was that the subcommittee found that the decline of the railroad was largely caused by overregulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.515" offset="19473429">Now, this over regulation was particularly severe in the inter-mode competitive pricing field.</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.729" offset="19506239">The Commission in the New Automobiles case, a case which has then referred to by Mr. Spritzer, a case which was decided 1945 had stated that it would not hold up the rates of one mode by artificial pricing restraints or differentials to protect the traffic of another mode.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.027" offset="19587532">However, while the Commission had announced this policy it was frequently deviating from it and adopting a diametrically opposite policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.942" offset="19631104">What the Commission was doing was using its minimum rate powers to prescribe pricing relationships or pricing differentials for the purpose of dividing the traffic among the various modes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4896.052" offset="19687528">According to its notions of what it thought were fair shares for each.</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.646" offset="19709994">Now, there were two effects from this paternalistic policy of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.188" offset="19732146">The first was it was depriving the public of the lower charges that the increased competition ought to bring about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.161" offset="19772061">And secondly and perhaps more importantly, it were depriving the railroad of the opportunity to effectively compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="4927.947" offset="19815111">Now when the two committees of the Senate and House, the committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee studied the report of the Senate subcommittee, they too were convinced that there was need for a legislation to relax the Commission's policy with respect to inter-mode competitive pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4952.366" offset="19912808">And to accomplish this, the committees recommended the statutory language which it presently found in Section 15a (3) and that the recommendations of the committee were accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4965.309" offset="19964635">And that language which was read to you by Mr. Ginnane, it would became part of the Transportation Act in 1958 and it is the law governing this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4978.048" offset="20015522">If I might briefly summarize the background of this legislation, it was a product of a very serious concern when a part of a Congress with the drastic decline of the taking place in the railroad industry, which the Congress felt was undermining the -- the nation's of the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4997.667" offset="20093994">By the same -- at the same time, the railroad competitors were flourishing and receiving a larger and larger share of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5007.520" offset="20133491">The Congress was convinced that the decline of the railroad was largely occasioned by the action on the part of the Commission of using artificial pricing differentials, pegging rate to protect the traffic of one mode from the pricing reduction of another, and to terminate this policy on the part of the Commission, the Congress enacted the Section 15a (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="5032.809" offset="20234637">So it's against this background of a rapidly declining railroad industry, which was causing great concern to the Congress that this pricing adjustment ought to be viewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5044.525" offset="20281448">Now, if I might, I would like just momentarily to briefly comment on the circumstances surrounding the adjustment itself that we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5057.068" offset="20331604">The legislation involved which ultimately became Section 15a (3) was before the Congress in 1957 and it was that time when the railroad were in their most depressed condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5071.985" offset="20391267">And I might say that while the depression of the 1957 and 1958 is over for industry generally, the railroad and particularly those in the east are still seriously depressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.394" offset="20440900">When these conditions were just about at their worst for the railroad, Sea-Land one of the appellants here announced in the press and in the journal that it was reentering the coastwise trade with a brand new containership service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5102.649" offset="20513938">And as it been explained, this containership service moved highway containers on ships between the port and provide what is in effect the counterpart of a motor carrier service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5118.463" offset="20577259">So far as the shipper is concerned or the consignee is concerned, it's a motor carrier service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.901" offset="20598993">The freight is picked up at the shipper's door in a motor vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.970" offset="20619264">It's moved in the motor vehicle to the port with the lading intact, no handling of the lading, the container is lifted off the chassis, placed on a ship and moved to a port in the south or the southwest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5142.735" offset="20674330">There, it's unloaded with again with lading intact, placed on a highway trailer, moved over the highway from just the same manner that the motor carrier would through to the consignee place of business.</text>

            <text syncTime="5210.707" offset="20946213">Now, I might say that the railroad at this time and prior thereto had lost the great deal of traffic to the motor carrier primarily because the motor carrier service was genuinely superior to the rail boxcar service.</text>

            <text syncTime="5787.533" offset="23253556">Basically, the Commission says this, at first it distained in this case from deciding off on the basis of the inherent cost advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5797.041" offset="23291486">Now, very practically there was a good reason why the Commission didn't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5802.440" offset="23313115">In this case in addition to the 66 TOFC rates we have involved, there was some 600 of the Sea-Land rate involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5811.919" offset="23351045">Now, with respect to those comparing the cost of providing the service on those 600 Sea-Land rate, with the cost of the railroad and boxcar service, the Commission cost section found that the railroad with a low cost carrier, in a great many instances, actually, the record before the Commission indicated that they were low cost carrier in most every instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="5839.700" offset="23462222">If they had based this decision upon an inherent cost advantage, the effect would've been that the railroads would've been entitled to the differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="5847.929" offset="23495137">And of course, that would've worsened the situation so far as Sea-Land was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5852.685" offset="23514154">So the Commission distained and put aside any, any use of the inherent low cost advantage and looked to another section of the National Transportation Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5864.407" offset="23560965">And they said this sir, they said the question is whether or not these rate reductions constitute unfair or destructive competitive practices, and then they found that they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5875.868" offset="23606836">And they found that they did for this reason, if these rates become effective they will attract traffic from Sea-Land and Seatrain and make it impossible or difficult for them to continue in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5890.250" offset="23664410">In other words, they say that a pricing adjustment which will result in attracting traffic to a carrier is an unlawful one if it will attract enough traffic to harm a competitor, if the diversion is inconsequential, if it doesn't amount to anything, then the Commission may not follow the prohibition in Section 15a (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="5917.121" offset="23771826">Now, the Commission went a little further than that and attempted to bolster to that basic proposition which was apparently completely inconsistent with the statute because the statute said, they shouldn't hold up the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5932.161" offset="23832012">And then the Commission says we can when we think it's to the benefit of preserving a carrier, to bolster that proposition, they referred to the national -- preservation of the national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5946.091" offset="23887705">And they in some very broad language said that the inter-coastal water carriers were important to the national defense and that they needed differential then they're favored to survive, and therefore, the Commission in order to preserve them, would prescribe the differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="5966.036" offset="23967535">Now, where the Commission got the figure 6% is nowhere in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5971.366" offset="23988851">Nowhere explained in their report, probably was an informed guess but the source of it is a complete mystery.</text>

            <text syncTime="6007.906" offset="24135032">Yes, improper sir, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="6010.530" offset="24145481">First, that there were no findings in the Commission's report to show in what way the national defense would be jeopardized if the Sea-Land and Seatrain were not preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6024.013" offset="24199398">There were no findings on that at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6025.791" offset="24206503">All the Commission did was refer to these two fairly old reports as pointed out by Mr. Spritzer, which indicated that there is some value to the national defense of coastwise water carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="6040.016" offset="24263450">But then the court went further and said that regardless of the adequacy of the findings, the Commission is without power to do what it did in this case by referring to the provision in the National Transportation Policy with respect to the preservation of the national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="6063.251" offset="24356342">The court said that the preservation of the national defense as I indicated in answering some other question was the hope for objective of the National Transportation Policy and was not a mandate to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6077.681" offset="24414124">In other words, the Commission upon finding that a particular carrier is desirable to the national defense or valuable to it, it cannot deviate from the requirements of the Act or the requirements of the National Transportation Policy itself, in order to preserve that carrier for the national defense purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="7012.078" offset="28151724">Sir, if I may bring my argument to a close because I know it's at the end of the Court's day and maybe my friend on the other side might have a few things to say, there just two last things that I'd like to comment very, very briefly upon and first is that the language of the court below and a long discourse of court below with respect to the preservation of a low cost advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="7041.369" offset="28268857">It's essentially a dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="7044.033" offset="28279515">It was not the basis for which the Commission decided this case and wasn't in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7050.034" offset="28303548">Now whether this Court would choose to endorse that or approve it, it's certainly not for us to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="7057.413" offset="28333014">But what we would suggest is and we again iterate that it is not a basis for this decision and we would suggest too that if the Court were to adapt that dictum or to approve it, that the Court not go further and try to, if I may say this with all due respect, layout guidelines as to how you would have determine the existence of a low cost advantage or how the low cost advantage should be protected assuming it was properly found.</text>
            <text syncTime="7090.977" offset="28467284">Those matters lie in the field of cost, carrier cost and relative carrier cost and they're extremely difficult and complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="7102.449" offset="28513155">There are areas in which there's a great deal of disagreement amongst the economists and accountants and we suggest that their matter is, at least in the first instance, are for the expertise of the Commission subject of course to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="7118.219" offset="28576266">And we might say that in expressing these views, we're doing nothing more than echoing what this Court said in New York versus United States, when it's indicated that the area of cost and relative cost was one particularly within the jurisdiction of the Commission in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="7143.892" offset="28678980">Now, just by way of conclusion, we ask the Court to affirm the decision of the three-judge court below and which set aside the order of the Commission as unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="7166.229" offset="28768319">Would I be fairly summing up the Commission's position if I were to suggest they would read that last sentence of 15a (3) as if it read rates of carrier shall not be held up to a particular level to protect the traffic of any other mode of transportation except to the extent as may be necessary and the like to achieve the objectives of that.</text>

            <text syncTime="7191.253" offset="28868420">First I'd like to associate myself with the last remarks of Mr. Helmetag on behalf the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="7198.299" offset="28896528">We feel with him that some of that detailed discussion, methods of cost determination and so on in the lower court's opinion is dictum at least in the sense that it wasn't briefed and argued by the parties, and by any of the parties, and they are complicated and disputed matters which I think it would be unfortunate if it turned out to be generally regarded as binding most upon the industry and upon the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7228.908" offset="29018990">Second that -- on pages 39 and 40 our brief, we refer to prior decisions of this Court and the lower federal courts as to the steady flat rate and as this Court did in United States v. Capital Transit with 325 U.S. and I quote, “Congress unequivocally reserved to the Commission power to regulate the recent openness of interstate rates in the light of the needs of national defense.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7254.969" offset="29123271">Now, that was after the enactment of the National Transportation Policy and I know of not a word in the legislative history, in the 1958 Amendment that purported to undo that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7269.312" offset="29180635">And similarly, we don't know of anything in the 1958 legislative history which indicates a purpose on the part of Congress, to undo that whole portion of the structure of the 1940 Act, particularly those provisions relating to water carriers, water carrier rates, 305 and 307.</text>
            <text syncTime="7292.659" offset="29274049">That portion of the 1940 structure from which of this Court found in the series of cases beginning with McLean, coming down to Dixie Carriers that there was a persistent national policy, congressional policy, to preserve or if possible efficient water carrier service for the nation.</text>
