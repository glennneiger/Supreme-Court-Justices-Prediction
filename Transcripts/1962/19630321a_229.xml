            <label>Mr. Harvey B. Nachman</label>
            <text syncTime="13.369" offset="156818">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.189" offset="176149">This is a case of a longshoreman who is injured on October 21, 1956 when he fell on the pier of the dock area.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.743" offset="230379">He was engaged in the discharging of cargo from a particular vessel and beans had become scattered about the pier surface in the discharge operation from bags that had been broken aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.121" offset="295894">He filed his libel in the Southern District of New York in January 9, 1959 and pleaded excusable delay in the absence of prejudice to the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.265" offset="352423">The case was then transferred to Puerto Rico, to the District Court of Puerto Rico, and the respondent answered the libel stating that, in its affirmative defenses, that the action was barred by laches.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.582" offset="413654">The respondent then submitted interrogatories in which they asked the names of all the eyewitnesses which were furnished to the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.685" offset="454092">Deposition of the libellant was taken and in March 1960, the case came on for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.476" offset="481259">At the end of the trial, the trial judge rendered a -- an oral opinion from the bench in which he stated that the only issue he wanted briefed was the question of medical damages, that he was satisfied, that there was negligence on the part of the shipowner, that the vessel was unseaworthy, and that both of these were the proximate causes of the injury, and that there was no laches because the respondent was not prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.734" offset="610304">Thereafter, the trial court rendered a memorandum opinion and formal findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.199" offset="640188">If I may allude to these findings of fact, they are on pages 18 and 19 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.343" offset="664743">The trial court found that many bags aboard the vessels were defective and broken, that despite the work of coopers, beans had been observed spilling from drafts as they were being unloaded from the vessel, and that the beans scattered about the pier created a dangerous condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.838" offset="742693">It went on to find that the cargo was defective and unseaworthy and that the shipowner was negligent in permitting the discharge when it knew or should have known that the in -- that injury, not the injured, but injury was likely to occur to people who were performing services on behalf of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.092" offset="827747">It went on to find that these were the proximate causes, and it also found that as to laches, all of the eyewitnesses were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.859" offset="874768">The potential eyewitnesses were known to the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.753" offset="894412">That all the documentary evidence relating to the voyage, the occurrence, the injury, and the medical treatment were available to the respondent, and in fact all of this documentary evidence was in fact produced at the trial by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.924" offset="951045">The Court concluded that it has jurisdiction and awarded damages in the sum of $18,250.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.078" offset="983646">The respondent appealed and the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed and found that there was no unseaworthiness, that there was no negligence, and that the libellant was barred by laches.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.403" offset="1056998">We have petitioned for certiorari stating that the decision of the Court of Appeals was contrary to the decision of the Courts of Appeals of all the other Circuits that have passed upon the questions herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.948" offset="1111124">And a certiorari was granted in October and the first question I think we face is the power of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit to reverse or to make findings of fact of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.156" offset="1183953">The trial judge had before him the petitioner and all the eyewitnesses, and their demeanor and their credibility were for him to judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.180" offset="1232123">He was a -- in a peculiarly excellent position as a trial judge to gauge their credibility and demeanor, and that they all testified in Spanish, and the trial judge was fluent in Spanish.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.011" offset="1295444">There was some conflicting evidence as between the eyewitnesses and some of the documentary evidence and there was conflicting evidence between the various documents that were introduced by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.311" offset="1356570">The weight of this evidence we submit was for the trial court as it was the question of laches, because this Court has held that laches is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.987" offset="1415293">I must point out that there was no conflict in the evidence as to the occurrence of the accident or how it occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.363" offset="1444864">And there was no conflict in the evidence as to whether or not the bags were torn aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.919" offset="1467016">The documentary evidence of the respondent proved that the vessels were torn aboard the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.741" offset="1490317">The Court of Appeals extracted certain items from the documentary evidence and gave them more weight than the trial judge did.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.343" offset="1528769">It made inference of its own, it even misread one document, and on each disputed issue, it drew contrary conclusions and contrary inferences than did the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.928" offset="1587075">Now, we submit under the McAllister rule that the Court of Appeals didn't have this power.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.081" offset="1615705">If I may go to the first issue which is that of laches, the Court of Appeals decision is interesting in that it says that the libellant or petitioner had no right to recover on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.218" offset="1684250">If it the petitioner had no right to recover on the merits, why discuss the question of laches at all?</text>
            <text syncTime="402.012" offset="1711417">Because obviously, the respondent had a fair trial, if the petitioner was not entitled to recover on the merits, but they discussed the question of laches and if I may allude to the facts that are in the record; the suit was filed in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.741" offset="1782366">In New York, the analogous statutes of limitations are three years for negligence and six years for unseaworthiness.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.411" offset="1812982">Upon transfer to Puerto Rico, this action was filed two years, two months, and 19 days after the occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.723" offset="1846314">In Puerto Rico, the analogous statute is set forth in petitioner's brief and it is as one year from the date of the final decision of the State Insurance Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.874" offset="1886856">The action was filed 13 months after that date, but that analogous statute is only a yardstick.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.634" offset="1921860">And the same Court of Appeals, three months later, held that to be barred by laches, an action must be filed, both after inexcusable delay and prejudice to the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.266" offset="1992391">In this case, the libellant or petitioner furnished the respondent with the names of all the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.035" offset="2019558">The respondent chose not to interview them.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.860" offset="2034813">The petitioner -- I'm sorry, the records introduced into evidence were by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.062" offset="2071594">They showed that the eyewitnesses whose names were submitted in answer to interrogatories were the only potential eyewitnesses by their own payroll records.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.244" offset="2112345">The respondent's documentary evidence included an accident report, reports showing broken and torn cargo aboard the vessel, spillage inside the pier -- inside the vessel and on the pier, the fact that coopers were being used aboard the vessel to sew bag and also ashore to sew bag that came off torn, and the entire medical history of the petitioner from 1951 to 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.786" offset="2226552">They had a physical examination of the petitioner and their doctor -- the record shows the doctor said that he had everything that the petitioner's doctors said that he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.549" offset="2273573">The Court of Appeals concluded that despite the findings of the trial court that there was no prejudice, that the witnesses' memory, were faulty in that, they also testified to the spillage of rice and rice was not discharged until after the occurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.131" offset="2359881">But the trial court never found that the libellant or the petitioner was injured by falling on rice.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.557" offset="2385586">And I think that the Court of Appeals has regarded prejudice as in terms of “Can I win” rather than “Can I defend” Certainly the respondent here was just as much able with all if its documentary proof and all of its -- and the availability to interview the witnesses to defend two years after the occurrence in Puerto Rico as it would have been six years after the occurrence in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.890" offset="2530931">This leads us to the question of, “What should the analogous statute of limitations be for laches?”</text>

            <text syncTime="830.513" offset="3425468">And the Fifth Circuit has adopted the reasoning of Mr. Justice Brennan and said that we will use the three-year statute of the Jones Act because unseaworthiness is the same, whether it occurs to a seaman or to a longshoreman.</text>

            <text syncTime="2913.256" offset="11756440">The trial court ruled out the defense of laches under the theory that because the witnesses were available and because there were certain records available that the respondent had not been in anyway prejudiced, the record clearly shows -- one, that petitioner after having hired an attorney, he slumbered in his rights for several months until he retained the firm of Messers Nachman on Feldstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.871" offset="11958836">First having spoken to them and explaining his problem, and because Messers Nachman or Feldstein could not handle the case until they obtained clearance from Mr. Cole, they waited until five or six months after the petitioner spoke to Mr. Feldstein.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.381" offset="12044936">I will concede that this by itself, will not bar the action unless it is shown that the respondent was prejudiced by the delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.861" offset="12098853">Now, the record shows very clearly that this petitioner, shortly after the appearance, he gave out sworn statements to an investigator of the Puerto Rico State Insurance Funds and in that sworn statement, he describes the occurrence as -- that when he -- the winchman pulled a sling in order to protect himself, he had to back out and he fell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.351" offset="12236779">Now, at the trial, he gives an entirely different version.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.257" offset="12272410">Petitioner also in the first statement gives the hour of the occurrences as -- that it happened at 10 in the morning, at a deposition, he gives sometime earlier than the other time, and then at trial, he gives another time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.228" offset="12348270">We raised these points to show that the memory of the witnesses after over three years was not the same, I mean, their memory; they could not recall the instance of the actual occurrences as they actually happened, and we believe that for that reason, there was enough in the records to show that the respondent had been prejudiced, was prejudiced, and that the action was barred by the statute of limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3132.260" offset="12632377">By the time we've got that, that list, all this time had left, they had already been retained by -- I mean the -- libellants had already retained his counsel and these were their witnesses, the one who want to testify for the libellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.864" offset="12710849">At the time of trial, it was shown at the end that their memory -- and this was not too long after the filing of the libel, not such a long period went by from the filing of the libel which were the first time that the respondent learned of the clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.040" offset="12807502">The respondent didn't -- had any knowledge whatsoever of the clients until about two and a half years after the -- after the -- the accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.105" offset="12871764">There is one last point which was raised by my brother here, and he mentioned for the fact that we should adopt uniform statute of limitations in this connection with this case, and he suggests that we follow the two-year stat -- statute of limitations provided by the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.370" offset="12972805">I would respectfully like to call the Court's attention for the fact that it is the law in our jurisdiction as established in a case called, Flores versus [Inaudible] decided by the First Circuit a couple of years ago that when a seaman is injured within the territory -- territorial waters of Puerto Rico and his employer is covered by the local Workmen's Compensation Act, that the remedy of that seaman, the exclusive remedy is to go before the Puerto Rico State Insurance Fund and he cannot sue his employer under the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.175" offset="13156080">That case was decided by the First Circuit and this Court; they denied a petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.089" offset="13187741">I would suggest that if that is the law in connection with the seaman in Puerto Rico, because of the special distinction has been made, because of Puerto Rico's peculiar political status, I would say, that in the case of a longshoreman which is discovered by the Workmen's Compensation Act, which Congress has delegated and the legislator of Puerto Rico to ruin on his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.253" offset="13328384">If the local law of Puerto Rico establishes the one year statute of limitations, I believe that an exception should be made in that case particularly when the provisions of the Jones Act are not applicable to either a seaman or longshoreman injured within the territorial waters of Puerto Rico.</text>
