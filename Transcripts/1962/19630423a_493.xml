            <text syncTime="16.700" offset="170193">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.087" offset="187747">The issues raised by the instant petition as the petitioners view it are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.909" offset="222960">First, whether or not, the District Court, and I say District Court for the Southern District of California, had jurisdiction to adjudicate the issues raised by a suit filed in that court and secondly, whether or not, the complaint states a cause of action warranting relief or requiring the trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.529" offset="345527">The complaint which I can summarize very quickly is in behalf of two persons, both of whom were subpoenaed to appear before the House Committee on Un-American activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.332" offset="404668">The defendant below, the respondent here, is an agent of that Committee, is the investigator for that Committee in California and the complaint recites in effect that the respondent secured or issued subpoenas against the petitioners for the purpose of harassing them and that particularly with respect to the petitioner Admiral Dawson.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.132" offset="531937">And I may say the only public official in this case is the respondent, Wheeler, the petitioner, Admiral Dawson is not a public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.986" offset="567359">He is -- the Admiral is merely his first name.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.694" offset="586167">Be that as it may, with respect to that petitioner that the complaint alleges that the respondent, Wheeler, arranged for the process to be served at Admiral Dawson’s place of employment with the intention that such service would result in a loss of employment and that as a result of such service at that place and for that purpose in actual fact, Admiral Dawson did lose his employment through this damage of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.053" offset="739558">The complaint as filed in the District Court sought both equitable and relief, and relief at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.253" offset="776338">It sought a declaratory judgment as to the validity of the subpoena and additionally sought damages on -- because of the manner of the service of the subpoena and the nature of the subpoena.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.975" offset="863274">Well, let me come.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.083" offset="867662">I -- I'll answer Your Honor's question right now that I had intended to do so in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.314" offset="888665">The petitioners, or the petitioner Wheeldin, has determined to withdraw his petition with a certiorari and asked leave of Court to do so and has so stated in the preliminary statement in the reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.544" offset="949582">We have done that because we feel that the damages to the petitioner, Wheeldin, are not substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.589" offset="977690">The jurisdictional statute requires damages in a sum of $10,000 and also there are some problems in res judicata which is raised by the Government which we think unnecessarily obfuscate or deviate the central issues so that, if Your Honor's grant a leave of court to the petitioner, Wheeldin, to withdraw his petition, the only petitioner remaining is the petitioner, Dawson, and the only matters which are at issue pertain to the petitioner, Dawson.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.929" offset="1103078">And I shall address myself, my oral argument exclusively to the issues as raised in the complaint in connection with the petitioner, Dawson.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.654" offset="1137977">Now, I brief -- further word by way of -- of the -- of the history of the -- of the proceedings below because that would, which I will now state, will -- I think, tell some light upon the import of certain concessions made by the Solicitor General in his brief, concessions which are to the petitioner of a considerable consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.861" offset="1242781">When the suit was first filed, the respondent through a licensed attorney and special counsel retained for the respondent by the Congress, by the House Representatives, urged that the Court have no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.882" offset="1302862">The trial court agreed with that view, but upon appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment and took the view that there was jurisdiction in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.789" offset="1354480">From that ruling by the Court of Appeals, the first decision that government took no -- sought no review in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.001" offset="1387395">In any event, at the second round, when the matter was remanded to the trial court, the Government then took the view that the complaint didn't state a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.062" offset="1431594">The trial court sustained that position granting a motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.925" offset="1455104">And that position was posited on the claim that the respondent Wheeldin, was -- had complete, absolute immunity from liability under Barr versus Matteo, the decision of this Court that a public official in some circumstances when he commits an alleged libel, he's absolutely privileged.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.069" offset="1539636">Before the Court of Appeals, the sole basis for the Government's contention was the claim of absolute immunity and the sole basis for the cause of ruling was absolute immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.493" offset="1585298">In this Court, however, and this is what I'm getting to now, with respect to the petitioner, Dawson, the Government recedes from that contention made in the courts below upon which the courts below rendered its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.417" offset="1645066">And it concedes that as to the petitioner, Dawson, the -- to the respondent, Wheeldin has no absolute immunity that the complaint alleges -- now, I'm stating my own view of the matter, that the complaint alleges that the respondent, Wheeler, secured subpoenas without the knowledge of the Chairman of the Committee or so far as the complainant is concerned, without the knowledge or approval of any member of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.478" offset="1777246">And I state to Your Honors now, so that Your Honors will understand what I'm saying at -- state in the context.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.735" offset="1802324">The applicable federal statute is a resolution by the Congress which is now designated by the House as Rule IX, which authorized -- which of course is set forth in the -- in our briefs, that resolution authorizes the Committee to hold hearings and with respect to the issue in subpoenas, expressly provides that only the Chairman of the Committee, or the Chairman of a subcommittee, or a member of Congress who was the Chair -- who is a member of either of this committees especially designated by the Chairman of either Committee may issue subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.032" offset="1971493">And so, the Government in this case, on the merits, concedes that the defendant, Wheeler, as alleged in the complaint and that is all there is before this Court for the trial court sustained a motion to dismiss, that the defendant, Wheeler, exceeded his authority and acted beyond his statutory powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.671" offset="2070026">And in effect -- now, I'm just paraphrasing it and using my own understanding of it, the Solicitor General will of course explain the position of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.721" offset="2110255">In effect, the Government concedes, as we view it, liability on the part of the defendant, Wheeler, but urges that -- that libel should be determined in the state court rather than the federal court on the ground that there is no federal claim stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.253" offset="2192384">Now, one further -- one further --</text>

            <label>Mr. A. L. Wirin</label>
            <text syncTime="538.222" offset="2256227">We concede it as a cause of action arising solely and entirely under federal law, having no basis in or rooted in any state law and for the following three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.689" offset="2310144">In the first place, we say that it arises under a law in the Constitution of the United States, certainly within the concepts announced just recently by this Court in a unanimous decision written by Justice White a week ago or yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.340" offset="2388720">First, because it's -- the cause of action stems from the -- a law of Congress namely, the resolution of a House, namely Rule XI, under which this Committees function.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.559" offset="2441592">And we say that probably construed that statute, barred the respondent Wheeler from issuing a subpoena without any authorization or without any knowledge of any member of the -- of the Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.810" offset="2514631">And that impliedly the statute having imposed an obli -- an obligation upon the respondent not to issue a subpoena, conferred a right upon the petitioner to be free from that kind of the exercise of excessive authority by an agent of the Committee, but more than that, we say that the cause of action arises under the Constitution of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.574" offset="2621628">I already talked about the law of United States, the jurisdictional statute, Your Honor, Section 1331, 28 U.S. Code, conferred jurisdiction upon the federal courts where a claim arises either out of the law or out of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="670.529" offset="2785468">First, with respect to the Fourth, which of course is a broad guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures, the Government makes the argument here that the Fourth Amendment is directed exclusively against the use of the securing of evidence or seizure through physical force only.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.670" offset="2890062">And we agree, of course, that the service of the subpoena per se is not the exercise of physical force similar to the seizure of a person through his imprisonment, or the seizure of books and papers which are the result of the -- of the search of man's defects.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.235" offset="2968325">On the other hand, this Court to -- seems to us has clearly decided generations ago, in Boyd versus United States, and as recently reaffirmed the view that a subpoena duces tecum, which is too broad in its scope violates the guarantees of the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1100.525" offset="4505475">Now, we think it's important to bear in mind at the outset that the conduct complained of amounted to nothing more than the issuance, purportedly unauthorized issuance, by the respondent of a subpoena ad testificandum, directing that the petitioner appear at a hearing of the Committee of the Congress and give unprivileged testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="1198.935" offset="4899088">There are a lot of -- there's a lot of torturous conduct which results in injury, which by no stretch to the imagination could be regarded as involving an infringement of the constitutional right.</text>

            <text syncTime="1217.336" offset="4972753">Now, I would like at this point to correct one statement which Mr. Wirin made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.136" offset="4995950">The argument which we are advancing in this Court was advanced in the Court of Appeals, the argument that the constitutional claim was insubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.126" offset="5035865">The Court of Appeals to be sure, decided it not on that ground but on the ground of the applicability of Barr against Matteo which as Mr. Wirin correctly points out, the Government does not rely on with respect to the one remaining petitioner in this case in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.772" offset="5090408">It would be pointless -- most certainly may in the brief which was filed below on behalf of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.554" offset="5121546">Now, we say that this constitutional claim is wholly insubstantial because even if it were to be assumed that there is a right to damages for a violation of the Fourth Amendment, this was the question which this Court left open in Bell against Hood, we think that the amendment cannot possibly be read as granting protection against being required to appear and give testimony to a legislative, judicial or administrative body, or granting a claim to one who in fact, some of the allegations of the complaint neither testified nor appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.201" offset="5272221">Now, notwithstanding this insubstantiality, we do not urge that the District Court was without jurisdiction to entertain petitioner's complaint under 28 U.S.C. 1331.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.199" offset="5320182">As we read this Court's decision in Bell against Hood, it is of no moment in the resolution of the jurisdictional issue that the complaint does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted under the constitutional laws of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.606" offset="5921834">Now, we submit if the Court pleases, that insofar as the claim is asserted under the Fourth Amendment, that we think that the history of the amendment, its terms and its interpretation by this Court, all compel the conclusion that the Fourth Amendment does not reach the issuance of a subpoena ad testificandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.200" offset="6028204">With respect to the history of this amendment, the background of the Fourth Amendment has many times been discussed by this Court as recently as in Frank against Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.734" offset="6070314">As the Court has noted, the Fourth Amendment had it's genesis in the infamous general arrest and search warrants which were prevalent in Great Britain in the 18th century.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.234" offset="6120260">And their colonial counterpart, the general writs of assistance which were employed principally in the colony of Massachusetts Bay for the purpose of the enforcement of the revenue laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.934" offset="6171146">Now, as it was made clear in both Lord Camden's opinion in Entick against Carrington which this Court has many times referred and which held that the English warrants were invalid and the famous argument of James Otis against the Colonial Writs of Assistance, the fundamental vice there involved to which the Fourth Amendment was directed was the denial of two essential liberties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.399" offset="6272920">The first of these liberties was the right of privacy in one's home, one's possessions and one's papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.489" offset="6301341">The second was the denial of the freedom from preemptory arrest and detention without probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.255" offset="6328404">And both the English general search warrants and the Colonial Writs of Assistance offended one or both of these essential rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.685" offset="6378141">The -- of the first American precedence of a constitutional character for the Fourth Amendment was the Virginia Bill of Rights of 1776.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.274" offset="6424430">Both its Article 10 which condemn general search and arrest warrants oblivious in the press and the like constitutional provisions which were adopted in six other states in the period between 1776 and 1784 reflected against a concern only for the privacy in one's residence and possessions for freedom from unreasonable arrest and complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.089" offset="6519724">Now, these we submit, are rights involving interests which are markedly different and considerably more important than those which would be affected by an unauthorized order to appear and testify at an unprivileged matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.008" offset="6583359">We think that the terms of the Fourth Amendment confirmed that it was not intended to protect witnesses from being compelled to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.613" offset="6613870">Testimonial compulsion, we submit plainly does not involve the right of the people to be secure in their person's, houses, papers and effects against an unreasonable search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.052" offset="6663607">Similarly, the issuance of the subpoena ad testificandum is by no means an arrest or in the terms of the amendment, the seizure of a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.585" offset="6701746">What the amendment protects against the net context is the immediate detention of the individual under a forced -- under threat of force or under the assertion of some legal right to detain the person at once not the direction that the person appear at some future date to give testimony before a judicial legislative or administrative tribunal.</text>

            <text syncTime="3640.807" offset="14666585">And so even if we could file a suit in the state courts in California, we will be met by the doctrine of res judicata on the ground that there has been an adjudication on the merits of the claim, and indeed, Mr. Justice Black, in Bell versus Hood, the chief case on this subject said that a ruling, granting a motion to dismiss because a claim is misstated is not a ruling and that the Court has no jurisdiction that's allowing another court with extra jurisdiction, but is a ruling on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="3704.126" offset="14919868">Now finally, let me say these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.519" offset="14933452">We think that sound judicial policy, but first, by congressional and federal executive policy calls for this kind of a case to be tried on the merits by a federal court rather than by a state court for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.943" offset="15015163">In the first place, the Congress has indicated a policy that suits against federal officials be tried in the federal courts by providing peremptorily in the removal statute that a federal official sue as this federal official is may summarily cause the matter to be removed to the federal court where he has acted under color of authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3763.717" offset="15158209">I'm merely drawing the comfort that at least in that respect the Congress intended that in that situation, a federal tribunal is a proper tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.403" offset="15208991">I'm going to say that in addition to that, the Department of Justice, and we set forth in an appendix to our reply brief, the policy of the Department of Justice of removal of cases to the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.264" offset="15260400">And we think it would be improvident and might even be unfair to public officials if their conduct was to be tried in a state court as subject to the vagaries of state court decisions and it could lead to a more uniform and more acceptable administration of justice where the citizen claims a federal official has deprived him of his rights if the federal district courts were to adjudicate those controversies.</text>
