            <label>Mr. Louis F. Oberdorfer</label>
            <text syncTime="8.276" offset="136443">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.361" offset="156818">I want to discuss in the remaining time available to the Government the defendant's contention that the individual defendants have been compelled to be witnesses against themselves in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.961" offset="247202">And that the so-called voluntary disclosure that was made in this -- at the administrative stage in this case should not have been admitted in evidence during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.283" offset="324524">The voluntary disclosure policy of the Internal Revenue Service and the Treasure Department prevailed for a period in the 1940s until 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.869" offset="378859">That policy was a corollary of our self-assessment federal tax system.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.277" offset="412505">That system assumes that when -- that the individuals assess themselves that they -- when they make out of tax return, they write down on the return the true facts of their liability, their income, and their deductions, and they file it.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.345" offset="468720">And it is from this that their civil liability is established.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.664" offset="490036">The voluntary disclosure policy in the period that we're discussing developed, as I say, is a corollary of that self-assessment system.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.798" offset="538520">It was understood by the then tax authorities that during World War II because manpower -- enforcement manpower were short because of the temptations of war time business and a lot of other things, that people may not and many people may not have met their tax -- their civil tax obligations on the return date.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.596" offset="633710">And the voluntary disclosure policy was adopted not to empty the jails and not to forgive people for crime, but to collect the taxes that might have been missed in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.393" offset="688985">And the policy was essentially very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.105" offset="703822">A person who had omitted income or understated his taxable income was told in a general statement that if before an investigation had been begun of his tax return, particular year, he came in and made a voluntary disclosure which presumed in its context and I -- we say in its text, that the taxpayer told all the facts were necessary to establish his civil liability and cooperated in the settlement of it that he would, having paid the civil liability and his civil penalties that mightily do, other government would not prosecute him for the crime of tax evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.293" offset="900577">In this case, we have -- so far as this voluntary disclosure is concerned, the question A of whether the disclosure was timely, that is whether it was made before an investigation had begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.069" offset="955643">And secondly, whether the other terms of the policy were met namely that the taxpayer cooperated with the authorities in achieving what was the basic objective of the policy namely; the establishment and payment of a civil liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.137" offset="1039966">In the posture of the case now, we do not contend that the so-called statement was untimely.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.270" offset="1084479">We acquiesce in Judge Norbye's finding that the disclosure occurred before an investigation had begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.478" offset="1133275">We do contend, and this is one of the areas, it's already been discussed on the facts that not only did these defendants fail to cooperate in the determination of their civil liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.912" offset="1211016">They didn't just sit silent and wait to be pursued which might be a questionable case.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.303" offset="1232541">They affirmatively and overtly attempted to deceive the authorities as to their civil liability acting under the smoke screen of their so-called voluntary disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.087" offset="1299728">The courts have had, the lower courts have already had cases involving the question of whether a so-called voluntary disclosure made after an investigation had begun, was admissible in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.229" offset="1372244">And the Second Circuit among others has held that an untimely disclosure that is one begun after an investigation, one made after an investigation has begun is not admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.821" offset="1426683">And as a matter of fact, the -- these cases include cases where the taxpayer was ignorant of the fact that the investigation had begun.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.001" offset="1471404">(Inaudible) and the lower courts have nevertheless held that such disclosures are admissible in evidence because the terms of the voluntary disclosure policy which are fairly clear were not met.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.367" offset="1744854">Mr. Justice Goldberg, there are some additional remarks in that particular speech which I'll just quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.461" offset="1789262">“In excusing the man from criminal prosecution, we are merely taking a sensible step to produce the revenue called for by law with the minimum cost of investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.474" offset="1837223">The man who makes a voluntary disclosure saves us a lot of money in investigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.450" offset="1857181">In return, we can spare him a turn in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.914" offset="1871078">This is your business from his standpoint and it is good business from the Government's standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.877" offset="1890931">That's as far as once your statement itself is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.432" offset="1905142">In addition, this statement of Secretary Schneider on May 25, 1947, which was subsequent to Mr. Wancho's statement which was before the so-called voluntary disclosure in this case and which is perhaps more authoritative than Mr. Wancho said having described the voluntary disclosure policy, “This presumes of course, that the recipient taxpayer cooperates with agents of the Bureau in determining the true tax liability”.</text>

          <turn speaker="louis_f_oberdorfer" startTime="498.386" stopTime="716.439">
            <label>Mr. Louis F. Oberdorfer</label>
            <text syncTime="498.386" offset="2096880">We have to concede, Mr. Justice, that there was never a ruling or a regulation having the formality and the precision of the (Inaudible) state, that certainly true.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.970" offset="2147244">But the whole context of the policy, we believe, puts -- put any taxpayer on notice that even if he -- if he, in this case for example, had come to the Treasury and said, “I know I've received some unreported income.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.458" offset="2217253">I'm not sure of what I did with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.609" offset="2225821">Or even, I don't care to tell you what I did with it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="534.085" offset="2239718">That would be one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.816" offset="2246614">This is a case where the taxpayer said that he'd received some unreported income.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.885" offset="2270960">But then came in affirmatively and attempted to mislead by a series of actions, a series of statements, and by the finding of documents, a filing which almost has the dignity of the filing of an amended return.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.494" offset="2337311">And this series of representations, oral representations to Mr. Sauber, the filing of documents to Mr. Lima, and the evidence we have of an attempt to fix the case by a settlement which presumed that the fictitious expenditures had in fact been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.095" offset="2447757">All those things are not mere passive acquiescence.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.998" offset="2471372">Actually, they are acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.676" offset="2482030">They are steps in the commission of the crime that's charged here, namely the evasion of taxes from 1945 and 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.890" offset="2522885">Mr. Justice Goldberg, you asked the other day about whether the filing of those statements was a crime and the answer that we gave at that time may have suggested merely that it was a separate crime punishable by a separate indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.056" offset="2595610">But the fact is, under this -- particularly under this Court's decision in the Beacon Brass case of which is cited in our brief, this particular act or this series of acts are, as I say, steps in the commission of the crime that was tried here.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.090" offset="2679724">And you recall that taxpayer's counsel suggested that this indictment was brought on the eve of the exploration of the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.773" offset="2722461">Under the Beacon Brass case, the statute of limitations began to run all over again when these taxpayers made these fraudulent representations which I say almost have the dignity of an amended return.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.778" offset="2810441">There is a question lurking here as to whether or not assuming as we do in this Judge Norbye found that these representations were fraudulent.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.785" offset="2854536">You recall it, Judge Norbye found in -- I quote his statement on page 1766 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.585" offset="2897690">The defendants made a dishonest, faults and fraudulent disclosure because such a disclosure did not conform to the true facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.156" offset="2936038">The so-called voluntary disclosure was concocted for the expressed purpose of misleading the tax official.</text>

            <text syncTime="3327.586" offset="13413752">And what Judge Norbye has been saying for years and years and years when you disclose on behalf of a corporation, you've also got to tell if the corporation officers personally have been up to any hanky-panky.</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.753" offset="13526392">Now as to the amount of the exaggeration, it was -- the Government claimed, it proved $454,000 by Lubben and his book which Government proof, not our proof, Government proof upon the remanded hearing showed had been doctored.</text>

            <text syncTime="3486.657" offset="14049991">Before a jury, can a judge say, “Well, I think the exaggeration wasn't enough that jury would have come in and found them guilty anyway.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.142" offset="14083950">And we say there's nothing in the history of this Court that indicates that our right to jury trial can be violated that much.</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.513" offset="14157406">This Court said, “That isn't -- they answered it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3522.957" offset="14195231">Now, the -- there was a question in this process of the Graflund conversion to this new story in which the chronology was quite involved the other day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.959" offset="14259179">If I might take a moment to give you that, Graflund testified as a Government witness on the original trial, he was asked, nothing particularly relevant to the disclosure although he had been thoroughly interviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.782" offset="14314454">And the notes that were brought out in the remanded hearing showed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.458" offset="14337233">When the reinvestigation started, he was interviewed by the Treasury on November 8, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.526" offset="14365445">He didn't tell the story about this of being true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.422" offset="14381014">On May 10, 1956, the prosecutors who had a grand jury working interviewed him at great length.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.030" offset="14415496">On August 28, 29, and 30, 1956, he was before the grand jury and he said, “I revealed all of these to Busby on a train in January.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.337" offset="14456769">I told them all about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.038" offset="14463561">That's the starting place of the disclosure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.776" offset="14474428">He was very graphic about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.508" offset="14481429">He put in details that no one had ever heard of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.216" offset="14500237">Now the proceeding is going on here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.291" offset="14512567">The motion to remand was filed in this Court on October 15, 1956 in an amendment form a month later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.474" offset="14545272">And on the 24th of November 1956, we filed our answer to the motion to remand in which we tried to be as vigorous as we could and we were unconvincing to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.260" offset="14600443">We said this is hearsay, all you've got is a hearsay affidavit from a Treasury detective and a Government lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.034" offset="14627506">Where are the witnesses?</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.276" offset="14632521">What are they talking about?</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.042" offset="14643493">The prosecutors then went back to Mr. Lubben on February 3rd, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.995" offset="14667316">And they made no record of what happened upon that interrogation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.777" offset="14686438">So I assume he didn't change his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.628" offset="14697932">They went back at him and got him in for another session on February 17, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.689" offset="14722173">And again, they made no notes or record of that one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.835" offset="14734712">So, we must assume that was unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.239" offset="14748296">But on February 20, 1957 for the first time, Mr. Lubben said, “Oh” -- or Mr. Graflund said, “Oh, it's a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.734" offset="14790301">I've never told this to Busby on the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.045" offset="14803571">Nothing like that happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.969" offset="14811199">I went out to see him in July and he was startled to hear there'd been any black market transactions."</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.908" offset="14835022">And then several months later on August 17, 1957, his affidavit to that effect was filed here.</text>
