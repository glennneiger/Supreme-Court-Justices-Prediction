            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 81, United States, Appellant, versus Georgia Public Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.749" offset="242395">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="36.087" offset="247724">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.652" offset="289938">This case, which is here on direct appeal from a three-judge court sitting in the Northern District of Georgia, raises two questions, the second and third questions on the merits, which were raised in the previous case.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.453" offset="361200">It comes before this Court on direct appeal from a judgment dismissing the Government's complaint for an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.733" offset="398294">The Government sought an injunction against the enforcement of the Georgia rate schedules on intrastate shipments of goods being shipped on the federal government's bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.099" offset="455764">The facts are in no way in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.531" offset="465481">They may be summarized as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.236" offset="476348">But there are in Georgia 25 federal military establishments and a number of civilian federal establishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.664" offset="514069">It's the obligation of the government, in a considerable number of cases when an employee is transferred from post to post for the convenience of the government, to arrange for the transportation of his goods or to reimburse him for the cost of transportation as the government may choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.731" offset="594317">The usual practice, and indeed the historic practice, has been for the federal transportation officers to arrange the shipments of these household goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.247" offset="640397">They negotiate a rate or award contracts to the lowest bidder.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.920" offset="667042">The property of all the employees will then be shipped on a single government bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.716" offset="694209">And, by government bill of lading, I mean not only one to which the government is a party, but a government form of bill of lading which has in it, as I shall point out in more detail later, a number of clauses which are not contained in the usual uniform bill of lading or other bills of lading of that type.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.764" offset="786474">In 19 -- then, the property is paid for of course or the shipment is paid for by the government check in due course of which incidentally usually involves an extension of credit that would be prohibited in the case of a private shipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.379" offset="852929">In 1960, there were about 1,100 carrier shipments within Georgia of the household goods of either military or civilian personnel on these government bills of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.117" offset="907891">The procurement activities are governed either by the Armed Forces Procurement Act in the case of property for civilian employees of the Department of Defense or the property of military personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.568" offset="969644">They are governed by Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, which is substantially the same, in the case of shipments of the household goods of civilian personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.769" offset="1018441">I will discuss the Act and the regulations a little later.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.219" offset="1036204">It's enough to say that in our view, they require procurement officers to obtain the lowest rates possible without regard to state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.479" offset="1077269">Now, Georgia has a statute of regulating intrastate truck shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.054" offset="1107571">It appears on page -- appears on page 69 in the back of our brief, at the beginning of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.166" offset="1148008">Under Section 613 of their Motor Vehicle Code, the Commission is given power to proscribe just and reasonable rates, fares, and charges for transportation by motor common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.543" offset="1201507">In another section, the Commission is given power to issue rules and regulations necessary to implement the Act and, pursuant to that power, the Commission -- the Georgia Commission has issued a regulation which appears over on page 85, that is very pertinent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.110" offset="1287816">It requires all shipments to be made under a uniformed household goods bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.141" offset="1315924">In other words, if this applies, the government cannot adhere to the usual government form of bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.538" offset="1341524">And down the last sentence in Rule 15, property of two or more families or establishments will not be accepted for transportation as a single shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.378" offset="1384887">In other words, the making of a mass shipment of the household goods of 500 or 600 or more people is prohibited at least to the extent that each must be made as a separate shipment under a separate bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.990" offset="1455313">In July 1960, there was to be such a mass movement, although perhaps not as large as 500 or 600 employees, of employees of the Department of Public Health from Savannah to Atlanta.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.369" offset="1532844">Now, the procurement officers of the federal government invited bids.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.956" offset="1551235">They received 15 bids -- 13 bids.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.283" offset="1564505">Eight of them simply quoted the Georgia rates on household goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.422" offset="1585089">Five bids were below the Georgia rates and the government accepted the lowest of those bids from Consolidated Van &amp; Storage Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.879" offset="1626885">Thereupon, the Georgia Public Utilities Commission threatened to revoke the license of Consolidated Van for -- or the permit of Consolidated Van for violating the Georgia Utilities regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.470" offset="1689266">A proceeding was started before the State Commission to revoke the license despite the fact that consolidated immediately broke its contract -- or immediately sought to be excused from its contract with the government, the United States sought to intervene before the Georgia Commission but was denied the leave to intervene, and thereupon, the United States filed this bill in equity seeking to enjoin the state authorities from threatening perspective truckers with prosecution under the state law if they should bid below the state rates on government shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.622" offset="1845896">The bill sought to enjoin the enforcement of the state regulation upon two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.978" offset="1875257">First, that it was inconsistent with the procurement statutes and policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.635" offset="1893961">Second, upon the ground that it violated the implied constitutional immunity of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.373" offset="1920815">Here as in the California case, a three-judge court was convened, the issue in due course was limited to household goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.424" offset="1961044">Originally, the complaint sought to cover all shipments on government bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.345" offset="1980792">Georgia took the position that her statute, for some reason that I don't understand, didn't apply to shipments of government-owned property but that it applied only to government shipments of property on behalf of its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.767" offset="2054457">As so limited, the case came before the three judges on a motion for summary judgment and judgment was entered dismissing the government's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.091" offset="2099702">The three-judge court said that it had difficulty in distinguishing the California Public Utilities case from the Penn Dairies case but that it thought Penn Dairies case was controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.591" offset="2157693">We then brought the cases here by a direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.514" offset="2177442">The first question raised by the Court's order postponing argument on the question of jurisdiction is whether the Court does have direct jurisdiction on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.252" offset="2224358">We think it plain that it does for the reasons that I stated in the argument of the California case yesterday, that one of our two grounds for seeking an injunction against enforcement of the state law plainly raised a direct constitutional question.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="552.103" offset="2311816">Meaning, by that, so far as it's an immunity -- implied immunity case, there is a direct constitutional issue and that, whether the Supremacy Clause case would give -- would require a three-judge court or not, needn't be considered because if there's -- a three-judge court is required as it is on the implied immunity ground, then it hears and disposes of all the issues and the direct appeal is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.129" offset="2423933">The two questions then which require some discussion are other questions of substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.623" offset="2453817">First, whether the Georgia rate regulation as applied to these shipments under government bills of lading is inconsistent with the controlling federal statutes regulation, and we submit that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.867" offset="2506794">The second question is whether Georgia's attempt to regulate the rates for shipments under government bills of lading violates the implied constitutional immunity of the United States and we submit that it does because it's an attempt to regulate the terms on which the government may contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="651.786" offset="2710549">Let me indicate briefly why I say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.064" offset="2727581">In the first place, so far as the argument based on the procurement regulations is concerned, we think that cost -- if it's inconsistent with the federal statutes, a cost impact is sufficient.</text>

            <text syncTime="693.115" offset="2875852">Nearly everything in the end could be reduced to cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.046" offset="2891525">I suppose, as I was going to use this illustration later, that a state building code purports to require iron beams of a certain size, fireproofing of certain types and style, is that cost or is that what we get?</text>
            <text syncTime="712.810" offset="2954637">Indeed, a good part of my argument is that the one runs into the other and that, when you're directly regulating the government, no distinction should be drawn.</text>

            <text syncTime="764.715" offset="3162258">And, anything which was inconsistent with that policy declared in the statute had to yield under the Supremacy Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="845.024" offset="3483460">Indeed, the shipments -- historically, these shipments have been handled by government procurement officers under government bills of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.042" offset="3527555">Indeed, it has been the historic policy of Congress to have these shipments arranged without regard to utilities regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.054" offset="3563604">For example, Section 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act exempts government shipments and government's bills of lading from the regulation of rail carriers, and Section 317 exempts them from the regulation of truck carriers on interstate shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.085" offset="3627760">Historically, the procurement -- and I use the word “historically” advisably.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.088" offset="3647718">Historically, the procurement has been arranged in these civilian and military household goods have been shipped without regard to state utility regulation statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.753" offset="3690350">And, in the very few cases which -- in which there has been any challenge to that, because most of the states have accepted it at least acquiesce, the government has quite uniformly been successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.909" offset="3746983">The California Utilities case is the most important of those, being the only decision by this Court, and we think that, despite the factual difference that Justice Goldberg calls attention to, that the regulations are the same, the statute is the same, their policy is therefore the same and that this is -- Georgia statute is more of an -- more inconsistent with the policy than the California statute was because the California statute at least opened the door or crack and said maybe you can get our permission to negotiate, whereas this permits no such negotiation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.709" offset="3914167">The opinion below, as I said earlier, followed the Penn Dairies case.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.623" offset="3949902">Here, as in the California Milk case that we argued earlier, we distinguish the Penn Dairies case partly on the ground that the statute has been changed primarily on the ground that there had been these two very significant changes in the regulations which the Court held to be a decisive distinction in the California Utilities case.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.337" offset="4048750">We see no difference between the cases in terms of the ownership of the goods, whether they're household goods or military goods, because in each instance the same statute and procurement regulations control and, each instance, it is the appropriated funds governed by those statutes which as the Chief Justice pointed out, will ultimately bear the added expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.721" offset="4170271">The statutes -- the comparison between the regulations involved in the California Utilities case and this case is a matter of detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.740" offset="4218337">It's all gone through in our brief and it seems to me that it would be a useless expenditure of the Court's time to go through those minute points and read them all aloud here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.595" offset="4265775">But we do submit, I'm sure the Court will find it so, that the statutes -- that the statute is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.262" offset="4292420">The regulations are substantially the same in each case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1098.915" offset="4498996">Because we do, in this case as in the California Dairy case, argue that the statute here, the Georgia statute, is unconstitutional because it attempts directly to regulate the terms upon which the United States may contract for the transportation of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.389" offset="4580916">And we think that that is under the precedence and reasoning of this Court and under, by principle, a violation of the implied constitutional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.599" offset="4629817">It may be worth recalling very briefly some of the established benchmarks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.071" offset="4659702">It set a law, of course, that the United States does have some degree of implied constitutional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.626" offset="4689899">Congress may expend the immunity by statute, it -- and has done so on occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.521" offset="4713409">It may waive some of it by statute, and it has done that on occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.167" offset="4736084">If, as I now assume for the purposes of argument, there is no relevant legislation, then it's for the Court to define the scope of the immunity in the absence of and pending in a more legislative declaration of policy on the subjects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.757" offset="4814451">There are two principles which are well set.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.371" offset="4832841">The first is that a state may not directly regulate or pass the property, instrumentalities, or activities of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.125" offset="4879862">One of the clearest illustrations would be a general property tax on a courthouse or post office building.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.736" offset="4906297">In the field of regulation, as the Court's decision sufficed several illustrations, a state may not restrict the kind of fertilizer that's distributed on the programs of the Department of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.446" offset="4957184">It may not, as the Court held in Arizona against California, require approval of a dam to be built by the United States or for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.037" offset="5007548">And, I should emphasize in this connection that the idea of direct regulation does not require that the United States be mentioned by name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.677" offset="5050075">The property tax is on all property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.007" offset="5059375">The statute doesn't mention the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.137" offset="5067943">It would clearly be invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.982" offset="5075257">In Arizona against California, the statute regulating -- or requiring a license to build a dam and requiring plans and specifications be approved didn't mention the United States, but it was held to be a direct interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.427" offset="5141086">The second rule that is well established is that a state is not barred from imposing nondiscriminatory tax or regulation upon one doing business with the United States merely because this would add to an -- it would impose an increased economic burden on the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.173" offset="5232097">In the tax field, the familiar illustration I suppose are the income taxes that the states levy or a tax upon the articles which a contractor may purchase, such as a bulldozer, shovels, or things of that kind, to perform his construction contract with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.501" offset="5325406">These are cases where the regulation states or the -- states what the contractor may do in relation to his activities rather than in relation to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.851" offset="5382771">For example, examples of valid regulation are the minimum -- state minimum wage and overtime loss which may be applied to one performing work under a government contract, safety measure of the boarding that goes over the girders when a building is being constructed, or I would suppose the type of scaffolding that might be used in doing the brickwork in erecting a courthouse or post office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.491" offset="5493321">Those kinds of state laws are clearly permissible and not a violation of the implied immunity, but I would compress them, and I think this is important, with the direct regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.714" offset="5558209">A state can't apply its building code to the buildings of the United States because this bears directly on the kind of building the United States gets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.186" offset="5596139">It can't regulate the size of the iron beam or the fireproof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.651" offset="5617977">It can't, as I suggested earlier, regulate the kind of a dam that may be built by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.354" offset="5644831">All those are direct regulations and, therefore, would be invalid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.682" offset="6410115">We're no longer one step remote and I would think that it was clearly done, not permissible for the state to do that, unless Congress chooses to waive the implied immunity because the court -- I want to make two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.343" offset="6476779">I will try to develop each.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.588" offset="6485765">One point that I wish to make, and I'll turn to it in a moment, is that this Court has always been careful, except in the Penn Dairies case, to preserve a distinction between regulating the contracts of the United States and regulating the activities of the contractor in relation to his employees or his dealing with other independent businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.098" offset="6583777">It is repeatedly said that the contracts may not be taxed or regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.229" offset="6608332">Second, it seems to us, and I'm going to develop the argument, that all the reasons that apply to cases like Arizona and California, where it was held that the state could not require that the dam plans be approved for a federal dam, are equally applicable to a case like this Georgia Utilities Regulation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.790" offset="6698506">Now, if I might deal first with the authorities and then expand to the reasons, the first instance to which this distinction between regulating contracts and regulating the contractors was drawn was in the well-known case of Railroad Company against Peniston in 18 Wallace and in Mr. Justice Bradley's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.401" offset="6801011">There -- from there, he said, “The case differs toto coelo from that wherein the government enters into a contract with an individual or corporation to perform services necessary for carrying on the functions of the United States, such as for carrying the mails, or troops, or supplies, or for building ships or works for government use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.398" offset="6880946">In those cases the government has no further concern with the contractor than in his contract and its execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.610" offset="6913860">It has no concern with his property or his facilities independent of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.484" offset="6933295">How much he may be taxed by, or what duties he may be obliged to perform towards his state is of no consequence to the government, so long as his contract and its execution are not interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.693" offset="6986167">In that case the contract is the means employed for carrying into execution the powers of the government, and the contract, and not the contractor, is exempt from taxation or other interference by the state government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.188" offset="7048129">This passage -- the distinction was not observed in many years, as the Court then began to contract the scope of the implied governmental immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.660" offset="7094000">This passage was, quite frequently, relied upon by the Court and always, I think, with the same distinction in mind that I draw here in the landmark case of James against Dravo Contracting Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.323" offset="7164635">Chief Justice Hughes quoted this passage at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.943" offset="7179160">It was quoted in the City of Detroit case, I think in Justice Frankfurter's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.163" offset="7204028">The same role was stated, indeed, laid down as part of the holding by Justice Reed for the court in the curse -- in the cursed Scurlock case in which the -- excuse me, Kern-Limerick Company against Scurlock in which the Court held that a state could not tax the purchases of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.546" offset="7313533">There was a dissent upon the question of whether purchase is made by a contractor as agent for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.868" offset="7346866">The goods that were going to be consumed in the course of his performance as a contractor was really a purchase by the United States, but there was no disagreement with the proposition that a tax on a purchase of the United States would be an invalid tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.198" offset="7420113">Now, it seems to us they're quite apart from the weight given to this distinction in the courts opinions, that also as a matter of principle or reason, the state should not have the power to regulate the contract of the United States, that is the actual terms of what the government may get from the contractor or what the government has to give the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.566" offset="7533589">I think the reasons that I am going to stress are the same reasons that support the general statement that a state may not directly tax or regulate the property, transactions, or activities of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1914.288" offset="7760541">I think that is a problem, is it not, a form in substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.414" offset="7773080">The substance is that the relations of the contractor with his employees are being governed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.223" offset="7804217">If there were an effort to make the government or the private party in the case of private construction responsible for the payment of those wages in the event that the contractor did fail to do it, then I would say that was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.873" offset="7886869">I've been a little troubled about the reverse case, Justice Stewart, but I think to put it illustrates the distinction I tried to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.339" offset="7924694">Suppose that the government put into its contract with the private contractor, a stipulation that he wouldn't pay laborers more than $1.50 an hour because it thought the state rates were outrageous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.947" offset="7987179">I think I would have to say then that the substance should control that this wasn't a matter of what the United States gets or what consideration it pays directly but rather was an attempt to expand out into this indirect area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.890" offset="8066905">And therefore, I would not think -- we don't have the case and I don't want it commit anybody for the future but intellectually, I would think that my argument should not extend that far, that I'm really concerned with what we get or what we immediately pay and that, if you can visage these terms in contracts that attempt to control more remote relations that they prop -- that they pose a somewhat different case --</text>

            <text syncTime="2054.021" offset="8319457">Yes, but I think it involves something more than increased cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.437" offset="8337115">It involved an attempt to regulate the contract of the United States and in a different sense than I think in your case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.088" offset="8383718">For example, suppose that a state provides, by statute, that no construction company within Arizona shall sign a contract for the construction of a dam that does not contain plans and specifications which have been approve by the State Dam Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.141" offset="8491969">Clearly, that is just as much an interference with the activities of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.701" offset="8514226">As a statute, it says no one shall build a dam that hasn't been approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.500" offset="8541393">And, I think this direct and indirect is hard to articulate but the way that I have put it to myself, and I submit that it has merit, is that your case is different because, also in form it has been made a part of the contract between the contractor and the United States, in substance, it really has to do with the contractor's relations with somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.427" offset="8665109">Now, I think perhaps one can put this in words by saying that if the state attempts to regulate what the United States gets or what the United States itself pays out, that then, it is a direct regulation of the contract within my rule that in the other cases may be not.</text>

            <text syncTime="2164.690" offset="8762180">I think that the government protects itself against such a situation as that, by doing its own work, paying the wages it saw fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.243" offset="8796348">As I imagine, that would draw a completely distinct line.</text>

            <text syncTime="2176.905" offset="8810977">It will be perfectly clear that the government was not subject if it does the work itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.121" offset="8835845">Of course, it has been stated on several occasions that one of the reasons that state regulation of the activities of the government is a violation of the implied immunity, is that it may interfere with the performance of federal functions through independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.088" offset="8931767">In one case, it -- the language expressly speaks of an invalid statute as being one that would affect or embarrass in any substantial measure the power of the United States to secure aid from independent contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.448" offset="8985161">That's not one of the older discredited cases and the point I'm trying to make here is that these -- that a regulation of the contract does embarrass the United States in -- or may embarrass the United States in carrying out its activities it -- through independent contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.380" offset="9088920">And, I mentioned earlier I think that it's equally an interference with the government's activities for the state to say “you shall not build a certain kind of building” or “you shall not erect a certain kind of dam” or to say that “no contractor shall contract to build a certain kind of building or to erect a certain kind of dam.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.573" offset="9185677">Now, of course, the degree of interference will obviously vary from case to case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.528" offset="9213471">In the illustrations that I have used, I have been putting cases where what the government actually gets is building a dam or some other public work is affected -- would be affected by the state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.962" offset="9279195">But in the California Utilities case, if one had gone to the general constitutional point that I'm now relying on, there would've been a very clear argument that to apply the state utilities rates to government shipments, government bills of lading, of military paraphernalia would directly interfere with the movement of military traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.025" offset="9423496">That's a very dramatic description of that in Justice Douglas' opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.883" offset="9442931">Now, that -- on the fact of it, Justice Goldberg, looked as if it was simply rate regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.470" offset="9469262">But in fact, it had these other indifferent consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.233" offset="9484309">I said here that there were interferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.268" offset="9500400">Most of them end up in money but they are not immediately money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.220" offset="9524224">For example, if the 50 states are empowered to regulate these transfers of government properties, civilian or military, then it will be necessary for the United States to deal with 50 state Commissions to have numerous, I guess not 50 but, numerous different forms of bill of lading, numerous different tariffs to compute, and it would require a very substantial complication in the already large transportation units in the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.780" offset="9670510">Take as another illustration, remember we are not dealing simply with the rate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.893" offset="9706977">We also have this Georgia regulation saying that you must ship on a uniform household goods bill of lading and that only one family's goods may be accepted as a single shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.497" offset="9765386">That has a good many consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.037" offset="9775522">For one thing, it would make it necessarily, apparently, to weigh each shipment separately, each family's goods separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.049" offset="9803525">Sometimes, the government arranges terms that don't involve weighing the shipments at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.968" offset="9823274">Other times, they can be weighed on men.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.129" offset="9835917">Here again, there is trouble, expense, and possible delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.752" offset="9862353">If there must be an individual bill of lading for each family, consider the consequences if you're moving 500 military personnel or civilian personnel in the Defense Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.574" offset="9909687">Instead of what I'm told, it would be about one hour to prepare a single bill of lading, you would have to prepare 500 bills of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.482" offset="9949288">It wouldn't be 500 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.166" offset="9956080">I'm told that if we're done on that scale, it would be about 15 minutes per bill of lading but, instead of one-hour's work, you're now in 125-hours work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.489" offset="9989308">And, this is just in preparing the bill of lading, going through for processing it through payment, withdrawing the checks and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.242" offset="10024312">But now I should agree, of course, that in the end those things are money and they usually hire more people from the government, but it's trouble and delay as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.250" offset="10076348">Second, the bill of lading contains substantive terms and the government bill of lading contains terms that differ from those under the Uniform Bills of Lading Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.205" offset="10128175">I'll take two as illustrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.690" offset="10138102">The uniform bill of lading normally contains a time limit, with -- within which, any claims must be presented for damage to or loss of the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.024" offset="10183450">That time limit is not -- it's not the same in the government bill of lading and, if my memory is right, there's none there at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2554.230" offset="10320332">Let me give one last illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.865" offset="10330781">The government -- you know, the government bill of lading now contains quite uniformly a clause requiring the carrier to stipulate that he won't engage in any kind of discrimination and employment by reason of race and color under the precedent executive order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.467" offset="10401207">Of course, no such clause is in the uniform bill of lading and perhaps we could find some other way of putting it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.412" offset="10432972">Also, it's not altogether clear to me because most utilities regulation says you can't add to the requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.764" offset="10462438">So, this is not solely a matter of money at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.681" offset="10486053">Now, I submit that there is no distinction between regulating the terms on which the United States may contract and the terms on which one may contract with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.521" offset="10565465">A contract is a relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.227" offset="10576332">It's an integral chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.613" offset="10585840">And I think to face up to it squarely, that the great fault in the Penn Dairies opinion, which is out of keeping with the -- which is contrary to the line of authority that I read, is that it doesn't deal -- not only that it doesn't deal with this difficulty satisfactorily, but it seems to me that it doesn't face up to it at all, that when you regulate the terms on which one party may contract with the other, you necessarily regulate the terms on which the other party may contract with the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.743" offset="10722304">You can't prevent John from marrying Mary without preventing Mary from marrying John.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.503" offset="10749367">The two with -- it's an integral thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.518" offset="10769429">It's like if you turn over the face, the adverse side of the coin, you necessarily turn over the reverse side of the coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.385" offset="10808926">And if you -- so here, if you regulate the price the utility must charge, you necessarily and inevitably regulate the price which the government must pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.037" offset="10867545">Indeed in this particular case, unlike Penn Dairies that I really don't think I understand on this distinction, in this particular case, the government has to have the intrastate shipment made by carrier permitted to do business in Georgia and therefore, by carriers operating under the regulations of the Georgia Utilities Commission, unless there's a sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.200" offset="10976214">In the Penn Dairies case, the Court adverts to the possibility that the federal government might have bought milk outside Pennsylvania and brought it in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.719" offset="11018219">In the California case, that's a practical matter than Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.592" offset="11033788">In the California, that is only a theoretical possibility that they'll bring milk over the Sierras.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.299" offset="11064613">And in this case, it's an absolute impossibility because anybody carrying goods in Georgia intrastate is, according to Georgia, subject to the regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2887.906" offset="11654980">The third one comes -- and the third point comes to grips more immediately with this matter of an economic burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.475" offset="11697298">Part of my answer is that what appears to be only an economic burden is often much more, and that one can't really distinguish between wholly economic burden and those that have to do with what the United States does, as I tried to suggest with the size of the iron beams or the character of the fireproof, but I would urge to the Court that there's an important difference here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.940" offset="11807117">That, the cases contracting the extent of the sovereign immunity, which was recognized in some of the earlier cases like O'Keefe against Graves and the Panhandle Oil case and the Indian Motorcycle case, that the reasons for contracting that are not applicable here and that the usual statement summarizing the net effect of those cases is not inconsistent with the proposition that we espouse here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.387" offset="11932923">But the usual statement is to the effect that a state regulation or tax upon one doing business with the United States is not unconstitutional merely because it imposes an economic burden on the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.740" offset="12006379">Now I submit, Your Honors, that that is quite different from saying that if the only effect of a direct regulation of the United States is economic and nondiscriminatory, then the state may do it, but those are two entirely different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.139" offset="12079940">Something which is not a regulation of the United States but has an economic -- puts an economic burden on the United States because of the economic enterprise is different from something that is a regulation of the United States and puts an economic burden on it or is a tax on the United States and puts an economic burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.328" offset="12172727">The general property tax is an illustration of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.862" offset="12182862">I suppose it's purely economic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.882" offset="12206895">Now, the broad immunity which the earlier cases or the middle cases, began to recognize was cut down I suppose, basically, for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.849" offset="12270738">In the first place, extending it to the activities of everyone who did business with the United States, as the number of people doing business with the United States increased, it began to cut off important sources of state revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.292" offset="12328521">State income taxes on any federal employee or -- income tax on a contract with a government would've been invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.333" offset="12364675">A second reason, I take it, was that this threatened to create sort of a class of especially favored citizens who because they did business with the federal government, were immune from state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.450" offset="12441161">And a third reason, which I think is important, is that you really didn't know in those cases just who was getting the benefit of this immunity, that in the general run of it, it was quite likely that part of the immunity was really going to the benefit of private persons and not affecting the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.933" offset="12535097">For example, in income tax, the immunity from state income tax on a contractor who is doing government work, you really didn't know how much of that had been -- would be passed on to United States or how much he would just pocket the difference himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.884" offset="12606882">I submit that these reasons are not applicable to a case where the state is attempting to regulate a contract of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.195" offset="12652126">The terms on which the United States may buy or sell the product it gets, the way the goods are carried, things of that kind because, in those cases, there is no play in the joint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.525" offset="12713462">It's -- I don't know whether the -- these analogies are helpful or hurtful but I've thought of this as one often does with direct and indirect like the links of a chain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.521" offset="12757452">If you yank on the contractor by making him pay the tax or by making him pay minimum wages, if it affects the United States, there may be some play or a cost-plus contract, the chain is already tongued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.290" offset="12820564">But, in the general run of cases, this role played the joint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.375" offset="12836864">But if you regulate the terms on which one may contract with the United States, the effect on the other party in the contract is immediate and indissoluble.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.570" offset="12885661">It's as if you had only one link.</text>

            <text syncTime="3281.092" offset="13227760">I would say that the kind of law I used, is notably, would be valid for the reasons I've stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3288.253" offset="13256391">I think, Mr. Justice Goldberg, that the -- my answer to you is correct and I think that one has to face up to the proposition that there are times where the governmental immunity may have consequences which do not seem, in the particular case, to be desirable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.447" offset="13361194">I would concede that that is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.794" offset="13370598">For example, if the immunity did extend all the way to the producer prices in the California Milk case, I think that the -- I know that the executive branch would consider that as undesirable result and something was done about it in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.768" offset="13454399">In other words, the general -- it seems to me, the general principle that a state may not regulate the activities of the United States is a sound one and a specific problem for the policy making branches of the government to deal with by waiving the immunity or as a matter of policy, insisting on compliance with the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.696" offset="13558157">I don't think the court can say that, “Well, we think the rate regulation in the California Utilities case was unsound, but we think it is a sound regulation in the Georgia case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.640" offset="13617925">I think that, in general, it is a sound principle until Congress acts that these direct attempts to regulate the activities of the United States or contracts of the United States should be immune.</text>

            <text syncTime="3409.111" offset="13739865">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.380" offset="13752926">I'd like to begin by briefly recapitulating what I say to be some of the significant facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.739" offset="13782288">The first fact is that this involves the movement of the household goods of nine families.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.463" offset="13813217">This movement of the household goods was from Savannah to Atlanta, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.956" offset="13835160">The movement was strictly intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.505" offset="13853341">These household goods are owned and used only by employees of the United States Department of Health and they are not, in any way, owned or used by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.788" offset="13910497">This movement originated and terminated at the private dwellings of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.546" offset="13937560">There is no question of session involved in this case or any area over the United States exercise its jurisdiction exclusively like a federal reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.178" offset="13988133">Thirteen of these carriers submitted bids.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.622" offset="14001821">Common carriers submitted bids in response to an invitation of the federal procurement officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.297" offset="14024600">Now, each of these carriers was required -- was required to apply under state law the higher Commission tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.970" offset="14063261">There are two tariffs in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.554" offset="14069635">There's a higher tariff and, as I say, the lower tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.810" offset="14086562">Each of those was required to apply the higher tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.427" offset="14101086">Eight of those carriers did apply such a tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.776" offset="14114461">Five of them cut their rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.107" offset="14123760">The lowest one, insofar as the government was concerned, was Consolidated Van &amp; Storage Companies Incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.526" offset="14153435">Consolidated bid a substantially lower rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.331" offset="14164720">However, what consolidated bid is approximately the same or lesser rate than prescribed by the lower Georgia tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.863" offset="14198784">Now, at the time this movement was made, there was in effect a lower Georgia tariff which was available to the United States which the United States did not use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.007" offset="14239431">And so, because of that fact, I do not believe the government could even make a clear showing of an economic burden on the fact that is presented with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.843" offset="14278719">Now, of course, in the argument on the merits, we assume that there is, for the sake of argument, an economic burden and I believe it's a safe assumption because this type of state regulation is permitted then, of course, they will affect to some extent an economic burden upon the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.362" offset="14356773">In setting this case for argument, this Court requested that counsels, in addition to the merits of this case, address themselves to the question of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.408" offset="14409017">Now, the complaint that was filed in the District Court attacked the constitutionality of the state law on three grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.486" offset="14441305">First of them was direct violation of several clauses of Articles 1 and 4 of the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.634" offset="14469935">The second ground was an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.392" offset="14484982">And, the third ground was the conflict with a federal property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 and supplemental regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.803" offset="14518627">Now, obviously, grounds one and two, if they are good grounds, would of course give this Court jurisdiction independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.328" offset="14548720">Of course, the question I'm addressing myself to is whether or not the complaint alleged a question of unconstitutionality within the meaning of Section 2281 of the U.S. Code Title 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.642" offset="14601906">Now, the first two grounds would involve direct violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.634" offset="14617893">However, after the case began and after the Court -- the three-judge court was convened, pursuant to a motion for a more definite statement being granted, the thrust of the Government's complaint was limited or sharpened to where it just involved the carriage of the household goods and personal effects of a personnel of the United States in intrastate commerce within the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.587" offset="14713710">And, of course, the goods involved in this particular case were the goods of employees of United States Department of Public Health.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.495" offset="14745370">Now, based upon such a sharpening of the complaint, I do not believe that the clauses which were alleged to be violated in Article 1 and 4 are any longer relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.215" offset="14800227">Such clauses are the congressional power to establish host roads to raise and support armies, to provide and maintain a navy, to provide for the militia, to exercise exclusive legislation of a real property held by session, and to make all need for rules and regulation respecting property belonging to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.604" offset="14889775">I believe the sharpening of complaint defeats those constitutional attacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.253" offset="14908374">The second one is the burden on intra -- on interstate commerce had been abandoned by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.130" offset="14931884">I believe it was somewhat farfetched to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.656" offset="14942020">Now, third ground, which I believe is independently gives this Court jurisdiction, is a conflict between the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 and the Georgia statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.229" offset="14992280">And, of course, the Georgia statute is -- two of those is 68-613 and 68-614 of the Georgia Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.399" offset="15024985">613 empowers a state Commission to prescribe rates to motor common carriers and 614 prohibits common carriers from discriminating as to rates and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.714" offset="15070229">Now, the parties, the United States and Georgia Commission, have resolved between themselves any preliminary questions of statutory construction which would address themselves to a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.609" offset="15125817">As between these statutes, there is a clear and definite conflict and, because of that, I believe this case, on that ground, presents a sole immediate constitutional question as defined by this case -- as defined by this Court in Kesler versus Department of Public Safety and, of course, if you recall, that case recently decided that this Court involved an alleged conflict between Utah Financial Responsibility Act and the Federal Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.787" offset="15242533">And it's interesting to note that that conflict there -- that no conflict was found to exist, the federal and state regulation was found by this Court to be compatible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.429" offset="15289135">Next, I'd like to turn to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.756" offset="15302405">Now, the United States allows more federal acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.417" offset="15317034">This movement was made and illustrated by the complaint and illustrated by the clear terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.177" offset="15336051">This movement was made on the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 and was not made under their Armed Services Procurement Act which was involved in the Public Utilities case, and by Public Utilities case, I mean the California decision -- the California public service decision written by this Court in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.831" offset="15414732">Now, the procurement provisions between those two statutes are quite similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.941" offset="15435107">Substantively, there's no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.128" offset="15443884">However, what is significant is some accompanying provision contained in Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.529" offset="15489442">However, before a banning in the Armed Services Procurement Act, our consideration of that, I'd like to call the Court's attention to the 1962 amendments of the Armed Services Procurement Act which is set forth in the appendix to the state's reply brief in Paul versus United States, the case you just heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.140" offset="15575960">And in the 1962 amendments to the Armed Services Procurement Act, there were some additional safeguards established for federal procurement, and in that, in those additional amendments, the Congress was careful to expressly state that it would not affect rates established by law or regulation, which I believe is consistent with the policy of federal procurement throughout, except where there are definite interferences of the federal function which were involved in the Public Utilities case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3927.094" offset="15811793">Well, to put it in a nutshell, in Public Utilities, there were involved military movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.220" offset="15832273">The movement of war material and a state regulation there violated the secrecy requirement and the speed requirement of military transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.420" offset="15873024">And, also, you had a state statute there that was formally addressed the United States and said the United States, that you can have law raised only if we submit ourselves to your jurisdiction, and the Court -- this Court has never tolerated that type of state legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.882" offset="15926941">I think, on those considerations, there was a direct interference of the federal contract whereas, in this case, the effect, if any, is economic and its indiscriminant and it does not limit the United States in moving these household goods in any way except imposed an indiscriminant economic burden.</text>

            <text syncTime="4004.785" offset="16122546">I think a very important distinction is found there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.111" offset="16135816">Now, as to the derivation of the statute, now, I have set forth in Appendix A of brief, the statute -- the federal procurement statute which were in effect when Penn Dairies was decided, now, you -- the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act and the Armed Services Procurement Act were both derived from those provisions in Penn Dairies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.097" offset="16219721">And, subsequently -- I believe the Court will find that, subsequently, there's no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4033.642" offset="16237902">And I think that brings into play an important rule of construction which this -- which is well-recognized, and that is when the highest court has interpreted statutory language which is, again, reenacted in subsequent legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.673" offset="16302059">The Congress, the legislative body, is held to know of the construction plates, the one that I believe -- I'm sure they did because of Penn Dairies, the landmark case, and who have adopted that judicial interpretation in the enactment of the subsequent statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.241" offset="16368306">Now, the Penn Dairies case is almost tailor-made for disposing this case for this provision of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.632" offset="16397876">And, if you will permit me, I would like to read several -- a couple of excerpts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.283" offset="16416475">The Court stated, in Penn Dairies, it is to be noted that while these statutes direct government officials to invite competitive bidding -- that's the federal statute, they direct government officials to invite competitive bidding by contractors undertaking to furnish army supply and also require them to accept the lowest response for a bid, if any is accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.716" offset="16494216">They do not purport to set aside local price regulations or to prohibit the states from taking punitive measures for violations of such regulation, that was referred to as the contract -- the prior contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.975" offset="16543222">Evidence is warning that Congress, in authorizing competitive bidding, has been so concerned with securing the lowest possible price for articles furnished to the government that it wish to set aside all local regulations affecting price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.810" offset="16598601">On the contrary, Congress has regarded the field of public contracts as one of which to exercise its supervisory -- legislative powers in safeguarding interests which may conflict with the needs of the government used solely as purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.336" offset="16664743">An unexpressed purpose of Congress to set aside statutes of the states regulating their internal affairs is not likely to be inferred and ought not to be implied with a legislative command, read in the light of its history, remains ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.970" offset="16727228">Now of course, that statement there calls into play a comment made by the Solicitor General, and he states that, historically, the government procurement contracts have been immune from any effect of the state regulation, but you have the decision in Penn Dairies in 1942 which is clearly against that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4175.029" offset="16803506">I do not see how you can -- how you can obtain any historical justifications from the precedence established by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.028" offset="16839450">The Court goes on to say, “It would be no more than speculation for us to say that Congress would consider the government's pecuniary interest as a purchaser of milk more important than the interest asserted by Pennsylvania in the stabilization of her milk supply through control of price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.541" offset="16893576">Now, we find an easy analogy there between the state interest in procuring a pure milk supply, and the state's interest in establishing a sound -- an economically sound transportation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.043" offset="16959509">Now, as far as deriving the regression you can from other Acts, we find there are many Acts that Congress has adopted which are solitary which have a sound economic effect in this nation but viewed from the government's position strictly as a purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="4232.485" offset="17033279">They may be thought to be adverse when viewed in that limited context, but to view the impact in the national economy, the government's purchasing power, Congress has only used that purchasing power as a -- to have ebullient effect on the national economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.277" offset="17092524">For instance, you have your Buy American Act, providing for preference in use of American-produced goods on all public works contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.764" offset="17122408">As to labor, we have the Eight-Hour Law, the Davis-Bacon Act, and the Walsh-Healey Act which fix sanitary standards, governing the form of labor on public contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.743" offset="17162324">There's also a long history of legislation whereby Congress authorizes various instrumentality to provide the payment in lieu of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.204" offset="17212165">The Tennessee Valley Authority, the Department of Interior, the Atomic Energy Commission, Saint Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation, and many other federal departments are authorized in their dealings throughout the nation, where if they were a private enterprise, they would be taxed to make payments because it's the law of the tax department to make payments to your state and local governments and there, again, we can see a congressional regard for the needs and the requirements of state and local government and, of course, that philosophy -- that congressional philosophy is consistent with the philosophy that's filed to this Court in its tax decisions.</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul Rodgers</label>
            <text syncTime="4347.548" offset="17493556">No charged services, except of course, at the effect that I think that Penn Dairies plays in construing current federal procurement statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.962" offset="17543189">Now -- returning now to Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, there are various provisions in there which to my mind indicate the congressional intent that federal procurement under that statute would be subject to state economic regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.348" offset="17612779">One of them is found in Section 201 (a) which authorizes the administrator, with respect to transportation of the public utility services, for the use of the executive agencies to represent these agencies in proceeding the involvement of carriers or other public utility before federal and state regulatory bodies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.332" offset="17692714">Now, the Solicitor General's brief tends to discount that by saying, “Well, that's up to the discretion of the administrator, so it doesn't really mean anything.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4405.550" offset="17725524">But, it strikes me as odd that if there was congressional intent that your state regulatory agency would have absolutely no control over federal procurement or no effect on it, I should say, or a federal procurement strikes me as odd, they would have an expressed provision, they are authorizing appearances before a state Regulatory Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.673" offset="17806085">And of course, we also have a well-recognized policy that's present in both Acts -- both procurement Acts, and that is that a fair proportion of government procurement will go to small business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.422" offset="17849031">Now, of course, it's a well-recognized economic fact, or at least to begin with anyway that big business can't supply cheaper prices than small business, but yet, the government goes out of its way to favor small business, so that aspect of our economy, the small business aspect of our economy will not become extinct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4455.648" offset="17925935">And of course, you have the executive devices to stimulate the economy where they are financial set-asides for labor surplus areas, for major disaster areas, and of course also for small business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4468.947" offset="17979120">Then, Section 203 (g), we find extensive provisions, two sections devoted to the fact that in dispose of the government surplus, that it will in no way impede the government's price support programs in the agricultural area, and the administrator is directed to coordinate his activities with the Secretary of Agriculture in such a manner to where the agricultural price stabilization programs of the federal government would not be adversely affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.752" offset="18102418">And then, we go on to the next section, Section 502 (d), which I think is very significant and that section reads in Court “Nothing in this Act shall impair or affect any authority of any executive agency,” I refer to federal executive agency, “to any executive agency with respect to any favors of any program conducted for purposes of resale, price support, grants to farmers, stabilization, etcetera, or rehabilitation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.208" offset="18224253">Now, I believe these provisions of course indicate a very clear desire on the part of Congress to take advantage of economic regulation to not -- to disturb that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4541.884" offset="18270960">Now, the Solicitor General in his brief says, in effect, well all that may be well and good but that does not apply to state economic regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.803" offset="18310562">Well, I believe that the implication is clear that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4555.665" offset="18326026">I believe, if it doesn't, I respectfully submit that Congress is suffering from schizophrenia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4562.324" offset="18352671">If on the one hand it has a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde complex, if in one hand it protects federal courts, federal economic regulation but on the other hand, slashes and disfigures state economic regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.437" offset="18417142">To me, the two forces are entirely inconsistent and I think the implications from this Act are clear that state economic regulation, where it doesn't impose any direct interference with the federal government, is to be abided by for the welfare of the national economy, and as I hope to show to your satisfaction later, to the welfare providing a strong transportation system in this nation which of course enhances the national defense of this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4607.150" offset="18531976">Now, I believe that the doctrine espoused by this type of -- by the Solicitor General, this doctrine espoused is -- to describe it succinctly, is pennywise and pound-foolish because I do not believe it's the intention of Congress that federal procurement officers should engage in cutthroat competition which has a detrimental effect upon the national economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.820" offset="18646601">Now, moving on to the effect of Penn Dairies decisions, the Penn Dairies decision and that is, in that case, the State of Pennsylvania, in the interest of protecting its milk supply and in the interest of providing a pure milk supply, promulgated certain minimum rates so that supply would be enhanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.465" offset="18741269">And of course, this Court held, I think wise and so soundly so, that that regulation should apply to the federal government because all in effect, all it did was imposed an economic burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.099" offset="18791737">Now, it looks like to me that in this -- what the Solicitor General says that what we're trying to do in this case is to dictate the term of the government contract, I think that that is the language is too strong for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4684.580" offset="18841684">I don't think that it's applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4686.759" offset="18850356">I believe that this had just as much effect upon the regulation of the federal contract in that case as it does in this case, and it is -- I do not think it is a regulation of the federal contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.251" offset="18900407">I believe it has an effect upon it but it does not regulate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4702.879" offset="18914931">Now, the Solicitor General relies heavily upon the Peniston case, a case decided -- not upon the Peniston case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.017" offset="18955473">He relies heavily upon the dissenting opinion in the Peniston, Justice Bradley's standing opinion which has received some added dignity because it has been referred to a couple of times in cases fairly recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="4725.935" offset="19007091">But it is a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4727.771" offset="19014405">The holding in the Peniston case, I think, militates against the Solicitor General because it upheld state taxation of the property of a federal instrumentality and also the Peniston case is decided in the last century.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.159" offset="19064038">But, I think that this -- that the regulation here in Penn Dairies does not dictate the terms of the federal contract any more than it does say -- where a state law requires the payment of minimum wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4753.265" offset="19116387">You could say just as easily there that the state is dictating the terms of the federal contract and for that matter to the tax cases because, of course, in every -- the -- an economic burden is imposed on the federal government, that right there affects the terms of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.110" offset="19175842">So of course, under the Solicitor General's theory, there right there dictates the terms of the contract and that theory is sound by the Attorney General, then he recall for a tremendous realignment of the decisions of this Court, not only the tax field but in these other regulatory fields as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.737" offset="19238327">And of course this Court, just recently this past month in Illinois' tax case, has again reaffirmed its position as the tax case is about economic burden, incidental and indirect economic tax burden being imposed upon the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4800.482" offset="19305305">It has upheld that as a result of state taxations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4807.136" offset="19331950">Now, as to the application to Penn Dairies, I'd like to read a couple of excerpts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.332" offset="19360684">There is no qualm to the Constitution which purport, unaided by congressional enactment, to prohibit such regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4821.569" offset="19389628">And the question with which we are now concerned is whether such a prohibition is to be implied from the relationship of the two government established by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.724" offset="19426304">Now, in this aspect of the Penn Dairies opinion, the Court is addressing itself to this Doctrine of Implied Governmental Immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.161" offset="19455979">The Court goes on to say the mere fact that nondiscriminatory taxation or regulation of the contract impose an increased economic burden on the government is no longer regarded as bringing the contract within any implied immunity of the government for state taxation or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4857.021" offset="19531421">The trend of our decisions is not to extend governmental immunity from state taxation or regulation beyond the national government itself and governmental functions performed by its officers and agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4867.485" offset="19573321">We recognize that the Constitution presupposes the continued existence of the state's functioning in coordination with the national government with authority in the states to lay taxes and to regulate their internal affairs and policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4880.538" offset="19625566">And a state regulation like state taxation inevitably imposes some burdens on the national government of the same kind of those imposed on citizens of the United States within the state's burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="4893.743" offset="19678333">Since the Congress has -- since the Constitution has left Congress free to set aside local taxation and regulation of government contractors which burden the national government, we see no basis for implying, from the Constitution alone, a restriction upon such regulations which Congress is not seen fit to impose, unless the regulations are shown to be inconsistent with congressional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4918.346" offset="19776763">Even the case of agencies created or appointed through government's work, we have been slow to infer an immunity from Congress which Congress has not granted and which congressional policy does not require.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.869" offset="19846875">Now, consistent with the philosophy reflected in Penn Dairies, we find the same philosophy in the tax cases, the Dravo case, where the Court reached the same conclusion even on the assumption that tax burden would be passed upon the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4951.794" offset="19910510">Again, there's a clearer definition of that doctrine, Alabama versus King &amp; Boozer, that say all of these tax cases are consistent with the case rendered -- the decision rendered by this Court on this past Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.901" offset="19978951">Now, Justice Holmes in the Panhandle case, which was subsequently -- the majority decision of which was subsequently repudiated in Alabama versus King &amp; Boozer, Justice Holmes wrote one of his famous dissenting opinions and a couple of excerpts from that opinion, I think, apropos to us in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.617" offset="20065886">The first is to come down more closely to the question before us, when the government comes into a state to purchase, I do not see why it should be entitled to stand differently from any other purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="5002.764" offset="20114474">It avails itself with the machinery furnished by the state and I do not see why it should not contribute in the same proportion that every other purchaser contributes for the privileges that it uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5013.435" offset="20157106">It has no better or other right to use them than anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.433" offset="20173093">The cost of maintaining the state that makes a business possible is just as necessary in the element of the cost of production as labor or code.</text>
            <text syncTime="5027.337" offset="20212694">The question of interference with the government, I repeat, is one of reasonableness and degree, and it seems to me that the interference in this case is too remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="5036.877" offset="20250833">Now, that dissent of Justice Holmes subsequently became the majority decision of this Court and it's continued as such until this day.</text>
            <text syncTime="5051.925" offset="20311124">Now, another case which I think is significant is the Esso Standard Oil Company case versus Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="5061.386" offset="20348949">That's another tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5063.606" offset="20357831">In that case, this Court held that the constitutional doctrine of implied intergovernmental immunity does not invalidate a state privileged tax in (Inaudible) storing gasoline, measured by the quantity of gasoline stored as applied to a contract of the United States who store gasoline owned by the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5083.770" offset="20438497">I think that these tax cases should logically apply with even stronger effect in the case of regulation, the case that we're presently with anyway, and even in the tax cases, of course the Court, in the tax cases, the money collected by the state goes directly to the State Treasury and, of course, that goes to, ultimately, to strengthening the vitality and soundness of state and local government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5109.374" offset="20540897">But at the same time, the -- any economic burden sustained by the United States in the case before us goes directly to strengthening the transportation system -- the intrastate transportation system which is used by the United States as well as for private use, and there is a more direct benefit in return achieved in these type of cases, I think, and even in the tax cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5130.195" offset="20624175">So I think, logically, the philosophy of the tax cases should apply with even greater force in cases of this nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.293" offset="20652596">Now, to move on to the Public Utilities case, now, the case there and I think to get the full impact of the decision of this Court in that case, it's well to begin with the decision of the District Court because the District Court wrote a very long opinion in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5155.399" offset="20725008">And, the District Court was very much impressed with the conflict between the interest of national defense and state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.294" offset="20756564">I have quoted that extract somewhat at length, in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5167.579" offset="20773700">I'll refer to a few on the specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="5170.770" offset="20786448">The Court said, “In this atomic age, speed in the movement of men and supply is vitally necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.161" offset="20816018">It would greatly impeded the discharge by the United States of its constitutional power and responsibilities by inevitably causing delays in such shipments when time is of the essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="5190.718" offset="20866278">And in many situations, would expose to the public patterns of movement and traffic which would be subject to interpretation by the intelligence agents of foreign powers and might jeopardize the security of the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.377" offset="20928867">Then, of course, the Court goes on and comment upon the fact that the regulation in Public Utilities, this California regulation, California statute was formerly addressed to the United States specifically and sought to bring the United States under the heels, so to speak, of state regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5226.117" offset="21007862">And, it goes on to this unique type of economic discrimination, this unique type of rate discrimination that was inherent in the Public Utilities case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5319.814" offset="21382666">But I think then, when you balance these two things in relation to the national welfare, I believe the federal government's interest in having a strong intrastate transportation system is more vital to the economy of the nation and to the national defense than the rapid movement of household goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="5336.424" offset="21449017">Of course, I think that under our regulation, this household goods can be moved rapidly anyway.</text>

            <text syncTime="5528.205" offset="22216182">Well I think of course, the procurement provisions are substantially the same, however, I think there are other provisions in the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, which indicate much more clearly than the Armed Services Procurement Act, that Congress intended that procurement of this nature be regulated by state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5545.423" offset="22285040">And of course, even as to the Armed Services Procurement Act, Congress has just passed the 1962 Amendment to that, whereby it set up additional safeguards for armed services procurement and made those safeguards -- made exceptions though as to cases where the prices were set by law or regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5601.681" offset="22510111">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5603.720" offset="22518262">Where we left off involved a consideration of the litigation in the Public Utilities case and I was just getting to the point about the unique economic discrimination that the United States was being subjected to in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.277" offset="22584508">Now, we all know that your military supplies, materials of war, are somewhat exotic, they are not the usual items for transportation for which commodity rates had been established for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5636.395" offset="22648978">Now, your civilian goods, just about always, move at commodity rates, which are somewhat lower than your class rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5647.260" offset="22692446">Now, the class rates are devised to satisfy legal requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5651.151" offset="22708015">In other words, every carrier, every regulatory agency promulgates rates which apply to any kind of shipment anywhere at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5660.420" offset="22745004">For instance, I think one illustration used by General Lasher, a witness for the government in the Public Utilities litigation who made the comparison of the shipment of oranges from Maine to Florida when, of course, no movements like that ever occur but there's a rate for it, and that rate is high.</text>
            <text syncTime="5678.993" offset="22819297">So because they were not commodity rates promulgated governing the shipment of exotic military supplies and war materials, the government, if it complied with state regulation, would be forced to comply -- to pay these higher class rates which you civilian shippers were not subjected to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5698.897" offset="22898918">Now of course, involved in our case is household goods which is a frequent item of transportation and which all regulatory agencies have promulgated rates for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5709.598" offset="22941759">And, you do not have that economic discrimination inherent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5716.773" offset="22970493">Going on reviewing this, General Lasher testified, nothing must be placed as an impediment to the complete flexibility and flow of movement of supplies to our troops in foreign theaters whether it's in peace or in war.</text>
            <text syncTime="5731.141" offset="23027963">Going on, there are many items which move today, which are not described, some items which are willfully misdescribed in order to hide their identity, and their moving in quantity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5743.214" offset="23076237">Were we have to go through a regulatory body, we would never be able to accomplish this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.738" offset="23106330">And there's also great emphasis on the testimony of the District Court placed upon the secrecy requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5758.033" offset="23135483">On the subject requiring secrecy in certain cases, Coronel Hall stated that reeling over a period of time every military shipment is in a sense a security shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5768.695" offset="23178115">Coronel Hall added he did not think it would be possible to reveal unnecessary data for logical and reasonable rate approval purposes in connection with many of the shipments, which are secret in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5778.521" offset="23217507">If everything is made public, we might as well publish it in the newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5786.433" offset="23249063">And the decision based upon this in this, this Court, and I think quite frankly so found a definite conflict because of the requirements -- the secrecy requirements and the speed requirements of transporting military goods, it found that California's regulation for program of regulation seriously interfered with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5809.616" offset="23341850">And because of that distinction, I believe, and also this economic discrimination, this Court reached the result it did in Public Utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5817.640" offset="23373928">But, in reaching that result, this Court carefully distinguished Penn Dairies, carefully distinguished Esso Standard Oil Company versus Evans, Dravo, King &amp; Boozer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5830.068" offset="23423666">It carefully distinguished all of those cases and preserved that policy which has been reaffirmed since then, time established with those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5841.362" offset="23468805">Also, it's interesting to note that on the same day this case -- that this case decided Public Utilities, it decided three more cases -- United States versus City of Detroit, the United States versus Township of Muskegon, Detroit -- and also City of Detroit versus Murray Corporation of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="5859.161" offset="23540067">And in those cases, taxes were imposed upon individuals having leased government-owned property and revive the leases that any economic burden derived in the state tax may be passed onto the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5873.155" offset="23595969">But yet, all three of those cases, this Court in the same day decided Public Utilities and handed down those three decisions and also in the City of Detroit case, Justice Black commented approvingly upon the Penn Dairies case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5897.214" offset="23692204">Now, in the brief, the Solicitor General places great reliance upon Kern Limerick, Inc. versus Scurlock.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.424" offset="23733060">Well now, that case right there is entirely consistent with Penn Dairies, with King &amp; Boozer because in that case, by virtue of drawing the federal contract, the tax -- where the state tax was being imposed directly upon the federal government and this Court has never tolerated any such as that and because of that, the Kern Limerick decision falls in line with the rest of these decisions and they placed great reliance upon Arizona versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="5940.549" offset="23865553">Well in that case there, the state -- in the construction of a federal dam, the state tended to have a hand in the prescription and specifications for the construction of that dam, but of course, the federal government cannot tolerate that because you cannot tolerate the imposition of state standards on the construction of a dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="5958.206" offset="23936188">Just in the case of Johnson versus Maryland, the state tried to have a hand in determining the qualification of persons who could drive federal mail trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="5966.449" offset="23969207">Well, all of that right there is a direct interference as distinguished from the indirect effect -- indirect economic effect in this case because, in our case, there is no prohibition upon the movement of the household goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="5981.092" offset="24027721">The federal government move household goods in such volume whenever and wherever it pleases.There's no impediment there, nothing but the indirect economic burden which has been sustained numerous times by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5999.058" offset="24099610">Now, I would like to devote the next few minutes to a consideration of these noneconomic burdens which the Solicitor General asserts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6008.942" offset="24139107">Now of course, I believe he places, and I think, a great emphasis on these noneconomic burdens because I believe that the trend of decisions as to the economic burden is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="6022.373" offset="24192815">He says one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6023.637" offset="24197935">For instance, he refers to the uniform bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="6028.500" offset="24217370">Now, that tariff provision is at page 85 of the brief for the United States and he says, “Now, state law requires that there'd be a uniform bill of lading on each shipment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6043.730" offset="24278288">Then, he moves on from that and he says, “And that's going to take the federal government a great deal of time,” but that's against the clear terms of the tariff provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.933" offset="24315068">The tariff provision places the responsibility of making that uniform household goods bill of lading on the carrier, not upon the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6063.061" offset="24355610">The obligation is placed upon the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="6065.752" offset="24366373">The federal government is not burdened with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6068.456" offset="24377240">The carrier must provide the uniform bill of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="6071.443" offset="24389151">The government goes ahead and issues its government bills of lading as before.</text>
            <text syncTime="6076.268" offset="24408482">It doesn't make any difference whether the government issues one or 100.</text>
            <text syncTime="6079.138" offset="24419976">That's completely unrelated to this requirement of uniform bill of lading that's imposed upon the carrier and not the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6085.927" offset="24447039">And then, he goes on to say, “Well, there's a conflict between the GBL, the government bill of lading, and the uniform bill of lading.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6092.974" offset="24475251">He only referred to two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="6094.346" offset="24480789">First that he said was that the uniform bill of lading specified at the time which claims must be presented, and there's nothing in the GBL.</text>
            <text syncTime="6103.229" offset="24516315">Well, I don't see any conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="6104.690" offset="24522167">I think the provisions -- I think the two bills of lading on that basis are compatible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6109.673" offset="24542020">He has another one as to discrimination, I believe, he referred to in the GBL.</text>
            <text syncTime="6113.213" offset="24556231">Well, that's certainly compatible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6114.453" offset="24561142">There's no state law requiring otherwise, and the two bills of lading are entirely compatible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6120.857" offset="24586846">The next provision he tried try to assert a noneconomic burden, first, this provision about the property of two or more families or establishments will not be accepted for transportation as a single shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6135.496" offset="24645360">Now, that right there is designed as to rate regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6140.088" offset="24663751">It doesn't mean there must only be the household goods to one founded place at one truck at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6145.155" offset="24684022">That regulation there is designed at the economic -- in other words, you can't combine that with other shipments and, thereby, try to get a lower rate because that's rate discrimination, but that's -- all it means is that each shipment must be considered separately for pricing purposes, for figuring the rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6163.385" offset="24756955">Now of course if you're going to move, say in this case like nine families from Savannah to Atlanta, there must be an evaluation of the weight of each family.</text>
            <text syncTime="6172.397" offset="24793004">In any system of transportation, you've got to have some mechanism for keeping the goods straight.</text>
            <text syncTime="6178.413" offset="24817037">You can't steer one's household goods together and then try to pick them out of the journey, especially going to nine different places in Atlanta, the goods must be kept separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6187.879" offset="24854862">As far as paperwork is concerned, there must be an individual weight determined for each one and when that weight is determined, it's just as easy to apply the state rate as it is a rate achieved otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="6200.911" offset="24907003">So I say that the economic burden -- that the noneconomic burdens asserted by the Solicitor General upon examination of this are nonexistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6210.995" offset="24947336">We go on now to this next one about -- in the next one, he says -- he goes onto the next one and he says “Now, if we have to follow the state regulation, we may have to comply with, say, 50 state systems.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6226.526" offset="25009507">When now, on the other hand, if you have this cutthroat competition, so to speak, that the government desire to stimulate or how the Solicitor General desire to stimulate these cases, then of course, the federal procurement office are going to be continually advertising, formally advertizing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6243.032" offset="25075545">They are going to continue to be negotiating contracts and renegotiating, and those contracts and the rates they provide for are going to be as (Inaudible) and vary, as there are a number of carriers seeking to do business for the government in intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6258.537" offset="25137507">Contrasted to that is if you have state regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6261.868" offset="25150882">You have a relatively few number of rates which must be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="6265.628" offset="25165928">So actually, the burdens are far less upon federal procurement officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6270.566" offset="25185677">This thing about having to apply with state regulatory systems is actually simpler than this process of continually seeking competitive bids and continually negotiating.</text>
            <text syncTime="6282.357" offset="25232802">Now they go -- he tried to go on to say that -- well, even though we have competition, even though the government procures its transportation and the competition ignores state regulation, well, that's not going to really affect the returns of the carriers anyway because returns have already been sent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6300.274" offset="25304482">Now, they set that up but that is plainly economically fallacious because once a return is set to give a fair return to a carrier, if he attempts to do business in an unregulated segment and does not follow state rate regulation, if he cuts rate, then clearly that's going to adverse -- adversely affect the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="6319.591" offset="25381700">And they say -- and of course, in some cases, we may have to pay more than a state rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6323.892" offset="25398941">Well, that's entirely hypothetical and I believe that if any group of carriers ever got together and tried to enforce a higher rate upon the federal government than what civilian shippers have to pay, I'm sure then that the Solicitor General would become an advocate of state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6340.502" offset="25465396">I'm sure they would say then to the carriers “Don't you know you're regulated by state -- the State Commission?</text>
            <text syncTime="6348.613" offset="25497788">Don't you know you're violating your rates?”</text>
            <text syncTime="6350.735" offset="25506356">And I believe that -- and of course, furthermore, that's hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="6356.074" offset="25527672">Also, as far as this talk about exceeding the demand, exceeding the capacity and had to pay more for it, I think it's a practical matter from the very nature of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6365.613" offset="25565811">I doubt if any carrier ever would be in the position, whereby he'd have to go out and buy new trucks because there are large firms in this nation to make a business of leasing trucks of a common carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="6376.457" offset="25609174">And so, for a big job, a carrier has available to these companies where he can lease additional trucks, and expand and contract his capacity as the bid increases and decreases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6392.140" offset="25671973">Now, I hope that I have shown the Court satisfaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6396.361" offset="25688795">There is no significant economic burden -- a noneconomic burden to speak of.</text>
            <text syncTime="6402.052" offset="25711574">However, in the case Davies Warehouse Company versus Bowles, there was a significant noneconomic burden placed upon a federal administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="6412.426" offset="25753057">In that decision this Court stated, and I'd like to read a couple of excerpts, “Simplicity of administration is a merit that does not inhere in a federal system of government, as it is claimed to do in a unitary one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6425.854" offset="25806764">A federal system makes a merit, instead, of the very local autonomy in which complexities are inherent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6434.120" offset="25839888">The existence and force and function of established institutions of local government are always in the consciousness of lawmakers, and while they're weight might vary, they may never be completely overlooked in the task of interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6450.567" offset="25905612">At a time when great measures of concentration of direction are concededly necessary, it may be thought more farsighted to avoid paralyzing or extinguishing local institutions, which do not seriously conflict with the central government's place.</text>
            <text syncTime="6468.818" offset="25978650">Congress has given no indication that it would draw all such state authority into the vortex of the war power, nor should we rush the trend to centralization where Congress has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6484.741" offset="26042284">Now next, I'd like to address myself to this criminal statute facet of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6492.112" offset="26071855">The Solicitor General then says -- now, there's a criminal provision which states that anyone aiding or abetting in the violation of these statutes is subject to a misdemeanor and consequently if our federal procurement officers were caught doing such a thing, we would be -- they would be imprisoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="6511.256" offset="26148446">But, I think that is clearly fallacious.</text>
            <text syncTime="6514.728" offset="26162239">I think, furthermore, an examination of the criminal statute and the California criminal statutes, the statutes are quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="6522.906" offset="26195048">The California criminal statutes are far more extensive, far more sophisticated in their application.</text>
            <text syncTime="6528.462" offset="26217200">They actually made -- they actually pointed those statutes to persons involved in non-utility businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="6536.425" offset="26249070">The breadth of those statute is much clear than Georgia statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="6539.919" offset="26263071">Now, I think, interpretation of Georgia statute would be governed by such cases as United States versus Farrar and others, United States versus Gebardi.</text>
            <text syncTime="6548.839" offset="26298702">United States versus Farrar held that a person who purchased intoxicating liquors under a federal Act was not the one that the Act was designed against.</text>
            <text syncTime="6558.897" offset="26338931">And the purchaser was not covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6561.817" offset="26350634">It was just the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="6563.287" offset="26356485">And, I think that Gebardi versus United States, the Board of Prosecution on the Mann Act held there they federal -- that the criminal statute was not applicable to a woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="6573.116" offset="26395878">It was the procurer that the criminal statute is aimed at.</text>
            <text syncTime="6576.581" offset="26409671">I think the same interpretations here can be placed upon the Georgia statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6581.590" offset="26429733">But even if we can see everything that the Solicitor General said as to the breadth of the criminal statute, I think there is a clear distinction between a noneconomic -- I mean an economic -- an incidental economic burden being imposed on the United States, that does not interfere with the federal function.</text>
            <text syncTime="6600.897" offset="26506951">And in comparison to that, the imprisonment of a federal official, so that right there, very clearly is an interference with the function of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6610.139" offset="26543940">And this Court has never tolerated such interference as that and, so long as it sits, I'm sure it never will.</text>
            <text syncTime="6616.520" offset="26569435">And very clearly, no state has the authority to imprison a federal official.</text>
            <text syncTime="6621.768" offset="26590438">Now cases like that which were (Inaudible) Johnson versus Maryland, they held the arrest of that postal employee was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6631.076" offset="26627636">In Ohio versus Thomas where you had the governor of this federal soldier's home, they held his arrest for not displaying a state oleomargarine sign is illegal and also in Neagle, which is a famous case where a federal marshal shot a man, killed the man in self-defense of a Justice of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6649.724" offset="26702242">But in case after case, it's quite clear that these state criminal statutes cannot apply to federal officials and that no state has the authority to imprison a federal official.</text>

            <text syncTime="6847.472" offset="27493230">Now in an economic sense, and of course that's how the Solicitor General attempts to push this over, economically, this is really more favorable to the state than Georgia's regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6856.135" offset="27527920">But in the constitutional sense, it's offensive because the United States is singled out, and it's made the expressed subject of state regulation.</text>
