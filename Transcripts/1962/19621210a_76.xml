            <text syncTime="7.863" offset="134875">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.011" offset="151385">First of all, I would like to say at the outset that Senior Counsel on this case for the petitioner, Mr. A.H. Dudnik very much wanted to address the Court but unfortunately is confined to a hospital in Cleveland having underwent major surgery but I'm going to do my best to substitute as associate counsel on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.242" offset="244381">Now, this case is before this Court on certiorari to the Court of Appeals of Cuyahoga County, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.461" offset="277191">It is an action brought under the Federal Employers' Liability Act, Section 51 through 60 as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.860" offset="314807">The case was tried to a jury in the state court of general jurisdiction namely the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.433" offset="365066">It was tried upon a special verdict statute of the legislature of the State of Ohio which actually had only been amended approximately a year before this case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.349" offset="428805">Now, I would like if I may before getting in to what I concede to be the real issue in this case to briefly discuss what the jury did find under the special verdict statute and what the Court of Appeals agreed that the evidence did support so that I can then go into what I consider the prime question in this case and that is what we claimed to be the fundamental error of the Court of Appeals in holding that despite the fact that the jury in the case found a causal relationship between the negligence which the jury found and the injuries to the petitioner which the jury found that such finding of causal relationship said the Court of Appeals or reasons which I will get in to in just a moment is not supported by the evidence, but would require the jury to indulge in speculation and conjecture and therefore the Court of Common Pleas instead of submitting the case to the jury in the first place should have directed a verdict for the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.796" offset="706539">And therefore the Court of Appeals upon a statute of the State of Ohio entered that judgment which it said the Court of Common Pleas should've entered for the respondent namely a final judgment for the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.714" offset="758262">And the court of -- the Supreme Court of Ohio refused to review the case under appropriate statutes and constitutional provisions of the State of Ohio thereby making that judgment final and permitting us to perfect our petition for a writ to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.418" offset="849063">It was -- actually, there were 16 grounds of error asserted by the respondent to the Court of Appeals which included among others the refusal of the Court of Common Pleas to grant its motion for a directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.737" offset="910294">The refusal of the Court of Common Pleas to enter judgment for the respondent railroad on the verdict of the jury being a special verdict which the respondent claimed entitled him the judgment and upon the refusal of a Court of Common Pleas to grant a new trial to the respondent for what it claimed for certain errors and trial procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.890" offset="1066924">This -- and I want to emphasize, this is terribly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.170" offset="1076015">This is not one of those cases where the court below having decided the case on one ground which would be sufficient to what to -- adjudge the case, found it unnecessary to consider other points of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.249" offset="1136410">The Court of Appeals in both its opinion and in its general entry went out of its way to say that it considered each and every amount of error which was asserted by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.282" offset="1184475">And the only one of those grounds of error said the Court of Appeals which we find prejudicial to the rights of respondent is the refusal of the court of -- what the refusal in the Court of Common Pleas to direct the verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.665" offset="1405994">Now, if I may I want to talk about that special verdict for just a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.145" offset="1431907">Now, up until the time that the special verdict statute of the State of Ohio was amended as I say was approximately a year before this case was decided, the special verdict statute in the State of Ohio provided that the jury was to find questions of fact and from those findings of questions of fact, the trial judge was to draw the necessary conclusions of law and then to enter the judgment which should be rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.144" offset="1543920">That statute was amended before this case was tried and the case was tried under the amended statute and the statute as amended said that it would be the function of the jury to try the determinative issues in the case and so that all that would remain to be done by the trial judge would be to enter judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.981" offset="1635244">And the amended statute removed therefore from the functions of the trial judge the duty of drawing the conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.861" offset="1674846">Now, there's no dispute in this case at all but that there is no issue of contributory negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.136" offset="1691878">That case -- that question is not even in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.932" offset="1703058">So that under Section 51, the only determinative issues which could possibly be present in this Federal Employers' Liability Act case would be; (a) Was the respondent negligent?</text>
            <text syncTime="412.959" offset="1755199">And (b) Did such negligence in whole or in part cause injury to the petitioner?</text>
            <text syncTime="419.932" offset="1783097">There are no other determinative issues which could possibly be tried to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.417" offset="1801070">But the trial court nevertheless submitted several ancillary questions to the jury dealing with factual problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.245" offset="1840358">But the jury did specifically find and one of the questions asked the jury is -- was and it was question 16 on the special verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.176" offset="1872123">Was the respondent negligent in one of more of the particulars alleged in the petition to which the jury answered, “Yes”.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.056" offset="1907545">And then they asked question 17, in what respect was the respondent negligent?</text>
            <text syncTime="456.543" offset="1929592">And the jury said, “In causing on his property or permitting to exist on his property a pool -- and I may not be quoting it exactly, this is the open and close, -- “A pool of stagnant water into which were permitted to accumulate dead pigeons, dead rats and bugs and vermin of various sorts”.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.541" offset="2009527">And then the jury was asked in other questions in the special verdict, “Did acts or omissions of the respondent proximately contribute to cause injury to the petitioner?”</text>
            <text syncTime="484.873" offset="2042859">And the jury answered, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="486.877" offset="2050905">And they were asked whether there was a proximate causal of relationship in any -- or in the slightest degree and again the jury answered, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="494.476" offset="2081311">Now, the respondent has argued vigorously however that the jury was also asked the question whether the respondent could foresee that its property conditions which are the substance of this action, the maintaining of a pool of stagnant water with all these vermin adjacent to which the petitioner was required to work whether the respondent could foresee that these would cause injury to the petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="533.128" offset="2235852">Now, let me -- what?</text>
            <text syncTime="534.530" offset="2241494">What (Inaudible)</text>
            <text syncTime="536.688" offset="2250167">Question 20 and this question is quite important.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.226" offset="2264273">I want to talk to you -- talk about that for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.073" offset="2283708">It's noted -- it's on the record on page 13 and it's known as Exhibit T, or question 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.899" offset="2310980">There was another question on foreseeability too and that is question 22 but the question 22 I think we can dispose of in a hurry because that was whether they could foresee the present physical condition of the petitioner and what happen is that he developed this ulceration which ultimately spreads throughout his body literally ate his legs away from gangrene so that after four years in a hospital, it was necessary to amputate both of his legs above the knee.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.358" offset="2412753">But I think the law is abundantly clear that a defendant in a law -- in a negligence action does not have to foresee the end result.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.553" offset="2441592">So that that question I don't think is particularly significant but I want to go back to question 20 for this reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="599.223" offset="2500315">Let me get to question 13 right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.454" offset="2509197">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.720" offset="2510242">Did the jury find a safe place in which to work and they said they cannot answer this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.841" offset="2530722">I would say on that at the outset that a similar question was presented to this Court sometime ago in another case from our office actually called Harris versus Pennsylvania Railroad Company which we cited in our brief, its 361 U.S.15.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.147" offset="2591953">In that case which was a general verdict for the petitioner, the jury likewise could not answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.549" offset="2621524">But in another question, the jury did find specific negligence and this Court held in a per curiam opinion where there was no oral argument simply that the decision of the jury was in line with the well known Rogers case reversed a judgment for the respondent and reinstated the judgment for the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.353" offset="2684740">In this case, although the jury did not answer that particular question, the jury did find specific negligence in one or more the respects claimed in -- claim in petition -- in the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.430" offset="2725073">And since the only other specification besides the general count of unsafe place to work that was submitted to the jury, the only other one was specification of negligence number 6 in the petition which may be found in the record on page 2 or page 3 and that specification is retaining -- pertaining to respondent and that it knew that by permitting said pool of stagnant water to accumulate dead pigeons, rats, bugs and vermin, insects would be attracted to said area and that his employers would have to work under unhealthful and unsanitary conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.672" offset="2874075">And we maintained that in substance when the jury answer question 17, that's what they had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.135" offset="2895914">Now getting back to question 20, the question was, if the answer is to any one, any one of the questions number 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 is yes, was there any reason to foresee?</text>
            <text syncTime="712.984" offset="2955264">Now, this I think is very important because the way the trial judge submitted the question to the jury, he never asked the jury if you can conceive of a collective situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.504" offset="3001344">In other words, all of these things be present at one time, dead rats, dead pigeons, pool of stagnant water and insects and requiring the petitioner to work there would that create a condition where it could be reasonably foreseen that the petitioner would be subject to harm.So that the jury could very well have answered question 20 by simply saying when they said, no, just one of these conditions alone wouldn't be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.720" offset="3098206">You have to have them all there together and in fact the jury did find them all there together in question number 17.</text>

            <text syncTime="843.779" offset="3478444">Now, I want to talk if I may again about question 20 for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.969" offset="3495267">Not too long ago, this Court decided a case called Ellerim -- now, it was the Ellerman Lines case and I got it cited on one of the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.026" offset="3615431">But anyway, the question there is very similar to what we have here and that's what I want to talk about for a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.195" offset="3640195">In that case, it was an action by a shipowner against a stevedoring company seeking reimbursement under what it claimed was the breach of the stevedoring contract requiring the stevedoring company the use actually the utmost care in unloading the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.529" offset="3717517">And in that particular case, what had happened was that as the burlap bags which are around -- had certain bands around were being unloaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.713" offset="3754193">One of the bands snapped and fell and it seriously injured the petitioner who recovered on a general negligence action.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.067" offset="3783659">And then the ship company brought suit for indemnity against the stevedoring company by whom petitioner was employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.850" offset="3810722">And the jury in answer to special questions found negligence but it also found in answer to a special question that the stevedoring company had complied in all respects with its contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.027" offset="3871431">Now the Court of Appeals, the Circuit Court of Appeals, said that as a matter of law, these were inconsistent answers because in order for the accident to happen that way as a matter of law, the stevedoring company had to breach its contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.607" offset="3925765">Therefore, it disregarded the finding by the jury and substituted its own finding thereby reaching a different result from the jury did.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.468" offset="3965262">But this Court held that that overlooked the fact that if advanced around the burlap bag broke this would be consistent with the warranty of unseen worthiness which would make all of the answers consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.223" offset="4028270">And it was the duty of the Court whenever possible to try to reconcile all of the answers and make them consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.827" offset="4054706">So applying that same line of rational to this case I say that when the jury finds negligence, when the jury finds causal relationship and the question is put to the jury in question 20 merely says anyone and omits presenting to the jury the question of the collective situation that that answer can therefore be reconciled with the answers to questions 16 and 17.</text>

            <text syncTime="1025.128" offset="4203917">I think there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.385" offset="4212903">In this case, of course, the finding by the jury generally of negligence on the general issue would be an equivalent to a general verdict of the other questions with deal again with -- be treated similar to interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.580" offset="4265671">Now, the real question as I see it thought in this particular case and by the way before I leave that last point, the respondent in its last brief to this Court stated that the jury was never charged on foreseeability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.274" offset="4332440">This is not in accordance with the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.827" offset="4346650">On page 5, 17, 18 and 19, the trial court very thoroughly charged the jury on the issue of foreseeability in relation to negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.989" offset="4411329">In special charges of writing prepared by the respondent itself because under Ohio law a lawyer has a right to submit charges and writing to be given by the Court and if these charges are correct they must be given in the language prepared by the counsel and submitted to the jury in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.619" offset="4485831">And the general charge to the Court is then taken to be in pari materia with the special charges and there are some total then constitute the total charge of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.706" offset="4522193">And the respondent itself prepared questions on foreseeability and those charges were given by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.083" offset="4551659">So the jury did have them and it is not correct as respondent states in its last brief that the jury was never instructed on the issue of foreseeability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.329" offset="4584678">Now, what the Court of Appeals found and this is very interesting to me was not that there could not be a causal relationship between the conditions because the two doctors who treated the petitioner both testified in no uncertain terms that there was a causal relationship, a medical causal relationship between the disease which the petitioner ended up with and the stagnant pool of water with its filthy conditions which we have referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.773" offset="4694497">The respondent's doctor took the position that there was no causal relationship so that this created a square question of fact we contend to the jury which was resolved in favor of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.938" offset="4739114">But what the Court of Appeals said was not that there could not be a causal relationship but merely that there were also other places where the contaminated insect could've come from and it evolved upon the petitioner to exclude the other places before the jury had a right to say that it came from this place although you have here -- and this is the picture that were shown to the jury, a pool of water with a track and the petitioner is standing about 10 feet away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.547" offset="4861576">This is looking through the south and it -- and all the witnesses testified that for many years there were accumulated in this pool of water and he worked from 10 to 20 dead or dying rats, pigeons, and different kinds of bugs and vermin crawling and flying all around this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.953" offset="4935137">Yet, the Court of Appeals took the position and this was another view showing the same thing.T</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.916" offset="4959065">he pool of water which leads to the south to a drainage ditch and the petitioner was standing about like so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.576" offset="4989680">But despite the fact that the petitioner was right next to a contaminating source, the Court of Appeals felt that it evolved upon the petitioner the duty of looking elsewhere or to eliminate looking elsewhere for this bug or this insect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.357" offset="5044851">And if I may draw an example against from a recent decision by this Court in a totally different type of situation not too long ago, last June, this Court was confronted with a problem in a case called Continental Ore Company versus Union Carbide Corporation where the Court of Appeals held -- the lower Court of Appeals held that a directed verdict on causal relationship should have been to the respondents because the petitioner failed to show that he had tried up all the other sources where he could've gotten this ore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.261" offset="5188420">In other words, the petitioner didn't show that he had made seasonable demand for such ore and that he had shown that all other source -- if he hadn't shown that all other sources where he could get the ore besides those of the respondents were dried up, he failed to meet his burden on causal relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.932" offset="5267101">And this Court held that no such burden evolved upon the petitioner or at least as I understand it that would be a question for the jury to draw the inferences and not the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.365" offset="5308792">And that the Court of Appeals was wrong in saying that a directed verdict should have been for the respondents that these were questions of facts for the jury and yet and in deciding that case, this Court cited its precedent, the Tennant case which of course is one of the leading Federal Employers' Liability Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.181" offset="5376084">And by the same rational, certainly where there is substantial evidence, remember the petitioner testified that although he never saw this insect he felt what was a hard shelled insect, he reported to his claim agent that he was bitten by an insect under the bridge before he ever had a lawyer or he was laying sick in a hospital bed that it was described as being a hard shelled insect about two inches long and an inch in diameter that he had seen insects that fitted that description crawling on these dead hives, in this pool of stagnant water just the track with the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.352" offset="5516831">There was no testimony that any such situation was ever seen elsewhere except underneath the bridge and yet the Court of Appeals said that the petitioner failed to meet his burden on causal relationship because he didn't show that there was any efficient causal relationship between the conditions under the bridge and the petitioner's injury despite the fact that the FELA provides and this Court has interpreted it in the Rogers case as providing that you don't have to show any efficient causal relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.724" offset="5646294">You merely have to show negligence in whole or in part and as a producing cause of a petitioner's injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.246" offset="5672312">So that where we are left now and why we have asked this Court to review the case is because at least litigants in the State of Ohio are being forced to litigate this class of case under an impossible burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.215" offset="5732185">Well, were -- or at least a burden which is totally inconsistent with what we concede to be the interpretation of that Act as this Court has put upon it time and time again.</text>

            <text syncTime="1448.539" offset="5897488">That in his opinion, an organism of some sort was introduced into petitioner's body through this insect bite which he felt as an expert on sanitation problems although not necessarily an expert on insects of necessity was related to the pool and filthy conditions there prevailing and that medical science was unable to properly control the spread of this disease once it was injected into petitioner's body which resulted in his debilitated condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.603" offset="6041788">Doctor Robin Anderson, who treated this man for two years at the Cleveland Clinic, in Cleveland, Ohio, testified -- to use his words and perhaps I can find them in a hurry, because I hate to misquote -- Doctor Anderson stated answer to a hypothetical question, “My opinion is there is a direct relationship between the state and the man's health, the insect bite and the stagnant area.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.290" offset="6196537">And elsewhere in cross examination, Doctor Anderson stated that the condition of the man in his medical opinion was related to the conditions that were maintained in this stagnant pool by reason of the filthy condition there and prevailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.355" offset="6280756">And I might add by the way, the last thing I want to say -- well, that comes up on this hypothetical question which respondents attack in their brief, I would like to point out to the Court that the respondent used the identical hypothetical question to their own doctor, Doctor Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.129" offset="6335927">The very one which they claimed the trial court should not have permitted us to ask, their doctor answered it differently than our doctor did or I should say the treating doctors did.</text>

            <text syncTime="1578.651" offset="6417951">Mr. Nurenberg has dwelled at some length on two issues presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.159" offset="6436028">He has not dwelled on the third.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.571" offset="6445641">He maintains at the outset and I should like to address the preliminary words of this matter what issues are present for the decision of this Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.770" offset="6482422">Mr. Nurenberg's reference in his brief and quote to a large extent also in his argument today has contended to the Court that the sole question presented for its decision in this is the question of whether or not the Ohio Court of Appeals was correct in determining that there was insufficient evidence of causation to take this case to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.558" offset="6565595">Respondent submits to the contrary that there are three questions presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.649" offset="6589942">First, the question of whether or not there was sufficient record evidence of railroad negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.263" offset="6612407">Mr. Nurenberg has not devoted any attention at all to that question up until the present moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.118" offset="6631842">Second, whether there was sufficient evidence of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.669" offset="6646053">And third, whether or not the special verdict returned by the jury in this case is sufficient to support a judgment for the petitioner or whether on the contrary it does not require entry of final judgment for the respondent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2474.849" offset="10002787">Alright, I pass now to the question of the record evidence of negligence which in the first instance where this determined the question whether or not the case should go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.680" offset="10050121">Petitioner had vacillated somewhat in his theory of the case and we've had some difficulty understanding just what his theory of the case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.057" offset="10083558">As originally pleaded and as tried, this case was presented on the theory that the alleged unsanitary conditions on respondent's property attracted an insect and that the insect bit the petitioner as a direct and proximate consequence of those conditions and that he has this disease as a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.441" offset="10173106">To me, it's absolutely indispensably essential to that line of proof that the assumption that a biting insect was attracted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.678" offset="10222111">Now however in this Court in his reply brief and I think for the first time petitioner concedes and he says the presence of an unidentified insects does not imply danger and that the real gist of his complaint and his cause of action is that there were unsanitary conditions on the property just that and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.922" offset="10311032">Respondent felt at the time of trial and continuous to feel that there must be three conditions which coalesce three essentials to cause of action such as this negligent of transmission of disease as it were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.963" offset="10367248">First, that there was a probable source of a medically known disease or infection on the premises and that respondent was unnoticed of that through the notoriety of the disease or infection whatever it may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.019" offset="10423463">Second, that there was a known means of transmission upon which respondent was unnoticed of the existence of it, whether an insect or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.910" offset="10462960">If an insect is essential, a biting insect, that's one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.939" offset="10475081">If not, there must be shown something else from which it could be reasonably anticipated by respondent that these property conditions gave rise to a risk of harm of some sort to its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.564" offset="10517608">Finally, there must be some evidence or some rational basis to infer for the jury that both the disease or the infection or the lack of sanitation or whatever phrase used to describe it and the means of transmission could by some reasonable means available to the Railroad Company have been either eliminated or reduced or in some manners materially controls the risk of harm to employee was lessened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.374" offset="10636831">Obviously, those three things are essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.109" offset="10647803">They doesn't know -- no railroad company can be charged with the duty of keeping its premises immaculately claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.626" offset="10673925">We know and there's evidence, abundant evidence in this case that there are microorganisms, potentially infectious microorganisms which are present everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.232" offset="10712273">They are present in this courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.847" offset="10718751">They're present on everybody's body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.734" offset="10726275">They're present in the pool but they're all also ubiquitous and nothing anybody can do or could ever try to do to -- could get rid of all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.660" offset="10758040">The same thing of course applies to insects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.633" offset="10769951">Insects are everywhere, we know all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.927" offset="10779042">The numbers of them, there are millions and millions of them and hundreds of thousands of species of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.427" offset="10797119">Many of them are not harmful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.327" offset="10804642">Many of them are beneficial to mankind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.304" offset="10820629">Nothing that anybody can do, can eradicate insect life and in the second place nobody would want to do that, just to hog anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.617" offset="10861798">Thus, the only insect life and the only microorganisms, bacteria and (Inaudible) -- and whatnot which reasonable care imposes a duty to remove are those which are harmful and those which reasonable care can eradicate, reasonable meth -- means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.308" offset="10940583">Now, what is the evidence of record pertinent to these questions?</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.561" offset="10957615">First is as to insect life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.021" offset="10967437">The only insects identified by name in this record are ants, flies, mosquitoes, sand fleas and Canadian soldiers, the latter two are seasonal little harmless bugs that flying off Lake Erie of the Cleveland in the spring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.045" offset="11035564">Those are the only names of insects which are -- appear in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.328" offset="11056671">None of them except mosquitoes can be thought of as -- that are -- none of them except mosquitoes are harmful to man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.113" offset="11071822">None of them habitually attack human beings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.058" offset="11095646">It's doubtful that mosquitoes can be said to cause legal harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.309" offset="11112573">They do bite as we all know but in Northern Ohio, as I think this record demonstrates, there is no history of malaria or yellow fever or any of the well known insect mosquito-borne diseases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.998" offset="11167326">Petitioner in this case did say that his testimony on this point being somewhat contradictory that he had seen on previous occasions insects two inches long and described it as the width of his three fingers and a half of inch in diameter about this big around as his little finger that being the size which he felt inside his pant leg when he flapped his leg.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.927" offset="11263039">He didn't see insects of that size on the dead hives as he called them which were in the pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.956" offset="11291146">Now, as to those, there is no testimony whatever as to the fact that any insects of that size are known to be of a harmful nature or propensity to attack human beings in Northern Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.306" offset="11348616">There is no showing whatsoever in this record that any insects or any harmful nature whatsoever would be attracted by conditions under this bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.746" offset="11390307">The record evidence is entirely to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.141" offset="11403891">The record evidence is coming from the only expert, entomologist, who testified in this case and he testified on our behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.054" offset="11435551">He said that the only insects attracted by the conditions under this bridge would be mosquitoes in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.851" offset="11466794">And no mosquito is involved in this case considerably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.486" offset="11481318">Mosquitoes and certain forms of carry-on or varying beetles which crawl their way into the dead animal life and consume it, those insects he said would not bite and would not sting human beings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.249" offset="11544325">There is no evidence that these premises would attract any insect which would attack human beings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.046" offset="11571597">It's true that petitioner's doctors hypothesized in their answer to the hypothetical question that some insects would be attracted by the conditions on the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.225" offset="11620289">All of them, both of the doctors however repeatedly and wholeheartedly conceded that they had no expert information or knowledge about insect life and their conclusions with respect to what insects would be attracted are therefore without anyway whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.061" offset="11715584">Now, if petitioner's theory at the present time be accepted that lack of sanitation without insects be accepted as a sufficient basis for the case to go to the jury, let us just look at that intention for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.337" offset="11784756">Petitioner says that merely the existence of these property conditions without any expert testimony whatsoever are sufficient to -- for a lay jury to conclude that risk of health or risk to the health of employees would be -- would result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.616" offset="11857795">But that is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.240" offset="11864377">There is record evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.352" offset="11868766">There is record expert evidence from both petitioner's doctors and ours as to what health risks were presented by the conditions under this bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.535" offset="11909517">I submit to this Court that the only testimony which in anyway can be said to support a conclusion by the jury of lack of sanitation being a risk to employees consist of one answer given by one of petitioner's doctors to a question asked on cross examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.069" offset="11999692">He was asked, “Doctor, how do you reach the conclusion?</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.723" offset="12010245">How do you justify your conclusion that there is a connection between the property conditions, the presence of the insect, the bite of the insect and the petitioner's disease?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.157" offset="12056012">That was one question which was answered, “Yes, I have that opinion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.051" offset="12071581">And he said, “Well, we know that there are certain recognized diseases which conditions of this sort enhance the growth of.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.609" offset="12109824">Alright, doctor what are those conditions?</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.467" offset="12121213">The only conditions, the only diseases which he was able to respond are plague, bubonic plague caused by rats in the middle ages and malaria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.564" offset="12165622">There is no -- not -- one other word of testimony in this record to confirm what risk of health -- risk to health was presented by these property conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.068" offset="12215672">In further cross examination of both doctors it was developed that their reasoning process goes something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.937" offset="12243153">It's a syllogism major or minor premise and a supposed conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.527" offset="12261439">They say we recognize that certain diseases, certain recognized diseases are enhanced, their possibilities of developing are enhanced by conditions such as for present respondent's premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.359" offset="12308773">That's the major premise notwithstanding the fact that neither of those recognized diseases has ever been known nor has any incident of this sort ever originated near this property before nor since.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.972" offset="12355271">The minor premise is -- petitioner suffers from a disease of unknown origin, having no understood medical cause, a disease entirely unprecedented for which there is not one precedent in any medical literature whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.730" offset="12426324">He suffers from this disease which he -- which had its onset at the time when he was present near this stagnant pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.747" offset="12458402">Therefore, the doctor says, “There is a direct causal connection between the filth and the pool and this unknown disease.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.123" offset="12499884">There are -- in a number of reasons why that reasoning process is unsound and must be disregarded and overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.548" offset="12529560">In the first place, as I have already observed the testimony is heavy in this record that microorganisms, that the only microorganisms which would be present in this particular pool are the same identical microorganisms which are present on everybody's body.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.602" offset="12601762">The testimony is that in inside our bodies and on the outside the same types of bacteria are present which would be present in the pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.407" offset="12645021">The doctors have ruled out all of these microorganisms as a possible cause of petitioner's illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.278" offset="12668531">They simply do not know what causes his illness.</text>

            <text syncTime="3444.329" offset="13880717">Number one, on page 548 of the record at the conclusion of the charge of the Court, so that there is no misunderstanding on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.274" offset="13932440">The Court asked counsel if there was anything further that he was charged on and Mr. Leasure speaking for the respondent stated on behalf of the defendant we do not have any request for an additional charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.058" offset="13995656">However, I want to save my exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.980" offset="14007254">And the law in Ohio was clear and I think that's the law generally that if there should be an error commissioned and I don't think there was one you can't take advantage of it if you don't call it to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.320" offset="14056678">And we do repeat contrary to this --</text>

            <text syncTime="3501.030" offset="14107460">That means that if there is an error of commission in the charge that if the judge said something wrong to the jury when he did say which could be precedentially erroneous then he would be entitled -- the party objecting would be entitled to a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.305" offset="14168586">But if there was only an error of commission then you can't find that error in the upper court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.776" offset="14194500">So at best, respondent's argument could only deal with an error commission and I repeat that if the Court will read the entire charge it's given before argument on page 518, it will find that the jury was instructed and no uncertain terms about this question foreseeability in its overall relation to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.251" offset="14260328">And I do claim that if foreseeability is in the case that on the basis that I gave that anyone is the significant answer and it can't be reconciled with the jury's answers to the specific finding of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.409" offset="14321037">Now, I would like to read if I may, the answer of Doctor Robin Anderson to a question imposed to him on cross examination which gives a fairly good chronology and it's found on pages 260 and 261 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.150" offset="14383940">And he says, the man had met -- I'm skipping the first paragraph about his arm, they treated him and he had a history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.292" offset="14404524">This man had massive ulcerative disease which from a medical standpoint and as far as medical evidence is concerned can be traced back directly to something related to a bite of some insect which was observed and found to be a small red mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.555" offset="14465546">Over a specific period of time, the small red mark increased in size.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.162" offset="14484041">At the end of six or seven days, this red mark had increase to something much longer with what we are told had a head on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.900" offset="14511000">And we must assume that this lesion at this time is the same lesion which started at the time of the original injury and I might say parenthetically that that was well verified medically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.396" offset="14548929">From this point on, their study progressed all of which is verified medically, from this point we have our own history in terms of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.347" offset="14580799">We must carry our basic reasoning back one step further and that is at the presence of filth, of rats, of dead vermin, of stagnant water predisposes to disease, predisposes to the growth of insects and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.109" offset="14631790">This man was bitten in close proximity to such an area of stagnant filth and it is only logical that we must assume that the probability is there that whatever it was and the insect and the bug is related to the presence of that area and this from a doctor who treated this man for two years at the Cleveland Clinic and as -- and is the Head of the Department of Plastic Surgery in that particular institution --</text>
