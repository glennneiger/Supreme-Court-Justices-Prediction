            <text syncTime="14.373" offset="160893">I indicated at the conclusion of the argument yesterday that a bargaining meeting of May 28th, the Company had indicated to the union that the superseniority that they thought they needed would have to be in the neighborhood of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.732" offset="258278">Well, in ensuing weeks, this superseniority plan, this 20-year plan, was announced to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.349" offset="320763">There was, first a letter by the Company on June 10 to all the employees and members of the union indicating that 20 years additional seniority would be given to employees who went to work during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.070" offset="427656">After that announcement, the number of returning strikers drastically shot up.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.858" offset="454823">Up to that point, there had only been about eight strikers who had returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.503" offset="477393">With the June 10 announcement, the number shot up to 87, and the next week there was a further announcement and the number shot up to 125.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.149" offset="523995">At that point, which is about June 25th, the union capitulated and decided that it would have to call on to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.729" offset="562239">A contract was entered into reserving the superseniority question for a further litigation before the Board and the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="588.387" offset="2456952">Now, Section 8 (a) (1), as the Court is well aware, makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to restrain or coerce employees in the exercise of Section 7 rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.186" offset="2508152">Now, a normal strike for economic objective is of course, a concerted activity protected by Section 7.</text>

            <text syncTime="629.497" offset="2621315">Now, the worker who accepts employment during the strike and the employee who returns to work are rewarded.</text>

            <text syncTime="643.992" offset="2679306">Well, the employee who stays on strike is penalized solely because he has elected to continue to exercise his right to strike and the reward and the penalty are inextricable.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.788" offset="2746493">They're like a double-edged sword because seniority is, by its very nature, a relative thing, and if you're going to boost up one person's seniority, you're necessarily going to reduce the relative seniority advantage.</text>

            <text syncTime="771.014" offset="3187440">But the thing that I wanted to point out before I get to Mackay is that the key to these cases is not merely, whether or not, the employer has an ultimate business motive for what he has been doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.594" offset="3277720">Now, it's true that not every interference with Section 7 activity amounts to a violation of Section 8 (a) (1) of the Act or 8 (a) (3) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.430" offset="3333099">It's been recognized by the Board and the courts including this Court that the National Labor Relations Act has to be read in such a way as to accommodate other competing legitimate interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.179" offset="3412093">And for that reason, for example normal business decisions such as granting a wage increase or reducing wages even though it may have an incidental consequence of affecting union or concerted activity may be privileged if motive is a legitimate one and you lose that privilege if the motive is not legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.871" offset="3518882">By the same token, however, there are -- is a class of activity and that's usually the situation where union or concerted activity is singled out as the basis for discrimination where the effect on the exercise of the Section 7 right is so drastic that it cannot be -- it is not privileged even though the employers' ultimate objective may be a business one.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.399" offset="3640926">Now, in Mackay, the Court held, and that was in 1938, that in economic strike, the employer in the interest of continuing his business could hire replacements for the strikers and give them permanence.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.980" offset="3707277">That was an accommodation that was made in the interest of enabling the employer to run his business.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.200" offset="5644204">The sole issue in this case is the Board's declaration of what it calls superseniority is per se unlawful in violation of Section 8 (a) (3) and derivatively of 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.188" offset="5704077">Because when I say derivatively of 8 (a) (1) because at the very beginning of this case, counsel for the Board said he was not claiming any violation of 8 (a) (1) aside from this so-called superseniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.445" offset="5769174">And there is not a word of evidence in this case unlike almost every other case that we have seen, that could support a finding of violation of Section 8 (a) (1).</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.570" offset="5813687">Put another way, in the absence of the illegality, the per se illegality of what the Board called superseniority, Erie Resistor was found guilty of no unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.760" offset="5866454">The affirmative findings are that it was not guilty of an unfair labor practice, that it did bargain in good faith, that it had a lawful, legitimate, economic motive for what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.823" offset="5926640">Up until the day, I have not heard the word per se mentioned in this case from the time of the original hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.896" offset="5966973">This suggests to me as I suggested to the Circuit Court, that perhaps the Board is not proud of its doctrine, I think it should not be proud of its doctrine per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.405" offset="6017024">Furthermore, as it clearly appears here from the argument made by my worthy opponent, the Board wants us to argue every case of superseniority, as they call it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.996" offset="6067388">They want us to say that superseniority is absolutely privileged, that it matters not what the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.994" offset="6103333">Under Mackay, any employer can grant superseniority just as he can replace employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.608" offset="6125798">We have never said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.677" offset="6134053">We do not say that now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.418" offset="6141053">It is not the theory of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.689" offset="6154115">It is not even in the Court with the facts of this case, it never has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.656" offset="6178043">This case, however, was selected by the Board as a vehicle to establish a per se illegality doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.082" offset="6211688">The Board's counsel said so at the outset of the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.306" offset="6232586">It upset my client a good deal to be in the middle of defending himself against this charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.282" offset="6264456">At the very time, the General Counsel issued a ruling, SR 509, in which on identical facts, General Counsel found another employee not even required to answer a complaint on the proposition that he had a lawful economic motive and that this was in accord with Mackay Radio and Olin Mathieson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.833" offset="6358706">We didn't think that was the way a board ought to operate, because this is a serious matter to the smaller company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.055" offset="6395591">It involves something over a million dollars in back pay and that's not a small amount of money to a company that employs 450 people or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.839" offset="6434774">This is a threat to every man in that plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.656" offset="6445955">Not just to replacements, but the strikers who have returned who incidentally are all working today, thanks to the fact the company has recovered from this strike after about two and a half years of struggle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.092" offset="6499767">The complaint against Erie Resisor had a number of counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.794" offset="6514500">One of them was this per se illegality, which was the real reason for the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.423" offset="6533099">Another was that in adopting the policy of superseniority, as they call it, their purpose was not to save the plant but to punish the strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.764" offset="6574477">This count was completely disapproved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.860" offset="6582836">There is not a word of evidence to support it in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.338" offset="6596733">The Board did not find out to be the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.336" offset="6604675">The trial examiner found that not to be the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.224" offset="6620244">Consequently, if motive be the test, Erie Resistor is not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.229" offset="6640306">There were many counts for refusal to bargain in various ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.853" offset="6658800">After all the hearing that we went through in the trial examiner's report and Board's decision, we were found not guilty of any of those charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.583" offset="6697671">This is an extraordinary thing in a case where an employer is charged with the violation of 8 (a) (3), because it leaves standing naked and alone this per se illegality of what the Board calls superseniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.792" offset="6754513">We have referred to the trial examiner's findings, page 59-a of the record and page 64-a of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.119" offset="6795891">Yesterday, I believe the question was asked whether or not there was a finding that this so-called superseniority was necessary to get replacements to come to work, and that's a rather extraordinary example of the treatment the Board has given to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.240" offset="6868302">Perhaps 350 or 400 pages of these thick books are devoted to prove that it was necessary to give what they call superseniority to the replacements to get them to come to work not simply because it's obvious that every man wants a permanent job and not a temporary one, but because we had extraordinary violence on the picket line here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.005" offset="6975404">And as you will see if you read the record, I believe it's the testimony of Mr. Burton that many people who were hired didn't come to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.413" offset="7029008">They were afraid to come to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.464" offset="7037262">We had 300 applications, yes, but you can't run a plant with applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.144" offset="7059937">You have to have people and we couldn't get the people because they would not risk crossing the picket line and risk the censure of these neighbors of theirs unless they were assured of a permanent job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.270" offset="7120436">It was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.460" offset="7125243">This is a finding of the trial examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.165" offset="7136005">The Board did not reverse that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.881" offset="7150947">Instead, on page 19 and not 29, the Board said it refused to consider this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.968" offset="7183235">It would not pass upon it because in the Board's view, any superseniority is illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.394" offset="7208939">They didn't use the words per se, of course, but any superseniority is illegal and therefore they didn't even consider this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.805" offset="7242585">And now when we come before the Supreme Court, I heard the argument made and it was not necessary to have this additional seniority for replacements in order to get them to come to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.484" offset="7297337">We could only wish that that was so, but it is not so and the record will not support such a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.723" offset="7346239">Now, we have to suggest that, and I think we have in our briefs suggested that the Board hasn't defined what it means by superseniority except to indicate that in its eyes it's something pretty bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.612" offset="7405798">After about 20 years of dealing with labor unions, big ones and little ones, and negotiating many contracts, I don't know what the word means.</text>

            <text syncTime="1929.381" offset="7820936">In other words, it didn't say this superseniority will go on for a year or a day, although in the settlement agreement, they did said, “It would continue until decided by the courts,” but had the union been willing to bargain on the matter, perhaps, we could have done something with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.870" offset="7886869">Mackay Radio doesn't fix the term either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.778" offset="7902438">Under the circumstances of this case, there was no way at all for this company to assure these replacements of permanence of tenure and to keep the promise, which I suppose everybody would want them to do, unless they either gave these people some additional seniority beyond the date that they were hired, the artificial credit that mentioned, or made some other arrangement with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.098" offset="8015809">Because we had on the date the strike began, about 450 people on layoff and under the contract that was in effect when the strike began, there was no terminal point for this seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.946" offset="8071189">It just went on and on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.984" offset="8079339">As Mr. Justice Goldberg would agree, I think, this is an unusual feature in a contract that there it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.172" offset="8104103">We had 450 people with no prospects of reemployment but having seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.971" offset="8131271">As a practical matter, certainly it would make no sense to replace people on layoff because nobody would take a job simply to be laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.237" offset="8168364">We had to replace people that were working and if we did and if we give the replacement seniority just from the date they started to work, as soon as the strike ended, they would go to the bottom of that 450-man layoff list and there would be no permanence of employment the fact that might just as well find.</text>

            <text syncTime="2156.907" offset="8731042">This is the narrow point in this case; not whether or not the Board correctly found facts because it didn't find any facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.416" offset="8761031">It said it didn't have to consider the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.191" offset="8772106">All additional seniority for replacements is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.491" offset="8789347">That's the proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.050" offset="8799587">The Court of Appeals would not accept that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.576" offset="8813693">The Court properly said, in violation of 8 (a) (3), motive is an indispensable factor and so it is under every case that has been decided in the Courts of Appeal or in the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.759" offset="8882448">Let us consider now what the Company might have done in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2200.817" offset="8906689">It might have simply replaced these people, said nothing at all to the union, and gone ahead and kept them out after the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.850" offset="8942738">It could have replaced every one of the strikers, which would have broken them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.664" offset="8966040">It could have simply not negotiated a contract containing seniority because the contract had expired and after the expiration of that contract, there was no seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.788" offset="9014523">To the company's everlasting credit it did none of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.953" offset="9031137">It never ceased to try to make a contract with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.478" offset="9049318">It never refused to sit down with the union and try to make a contract that had some usually satisfactory seniority arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.692" offset="9082128">It is not true that the Company insisted on superseniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.720" offset="9102294">The word “superseniority” was put into Mr. Farrell's mouth, but if you look at page 156-a of the record and 161-a of the record as examples of Mr. Farrell's efforts to make this clear, he said, “We took a positive position where we're going to have to have some sort of protection for these people in the way of giving them job assurance that we have told them they would have.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.879" offset="9242937">He did not say superseniority and at page 161-a, he was asked about superseniority by General Counsel and he said, “I object to superseniority per se because my company said the Company consistently evidenced its willingness to negotiate with the union as to the form of the assurance would take.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.813" offset="9318588">In this particular case, what we are talking about is the Company's effort to keep a lawful promise to the replacements that they would not be discharged when the strike was over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.041" offset="9371564">Now, they could have done this with -- excuse me sir.</text>

            <text syncTime="2391.738" offset="9670301">This is true of every case in which you have permanent replacements because the union's ultimate position was all the replacements have to be discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.207" offset="9708231">Well that made it very difficult to get a contract, but again, to the company's credit, they did get a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.381" offset="9740936">The strike did end and strangely enough, well, they're criticized for it, the record shows clearly that they hired only so many permanent replacements as they absolutely had to have in order to survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.185" offset="9796106">When this college let out in June, they hired college boys and told them, “This is temporary.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.838" offset="9818676">They used clerks who make awfully poor production people, I might say, and sometimes labor relations men who are worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.622" offset="9849814">And they try to get by with any method they could without displacing any of their striking employees, but if this plan didn't operate, it would die and it almost did die.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.069" offset="9907597">This was no question of just building up the profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.255" offset="9920345">This was a question of surviving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.513" offset="9929435">What was done here was purely defensive, but really no choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.044" offset="9955558">And yet in spite of this dreadful fact, the Company still tried to bargain with the union, it never took the position that the union is out or break the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.124" offset="10003832">It wouldn't make the contract of the union exactly the contrary is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.045" offset="10027551">Instead of condemning a company like this, it should be commended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.567" offset="10045628">This is not to say there was no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.341" offset="10052733">Indeed, there was, and there still is, but I do believe it's a kind of a problem that could have been solved by collective bargaining as the union had been willing to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.864" offset="10102784">I want to say one word too but the emphasis that's been placed on the additional seniority granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.534" offset="10141550">My friend, Mr. Come suggests in his presentation that perhaps the purpose of this grant of additional seniority was to entice strikers to come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.066" offset="10195675">That is absolutely unsupported in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.600" offset="10209782">The record shows that the contrary is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.913" offset="10223052">This Company carefully avoided an invitation or enticement to the strikers to return, but when they did or if man who wanted to come back to work, the Company didn't say, “No, you can't do it,” but the need for replacements was not to get the strikers to abandon the strike, it was to get strangers and outsiders to come in to work and this was the only reason that this policy was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.266" offset="10356485">Furthermore, the policy was adopted only after about 11 unsuccessful negotiating meetings in which it appeared that there was no chance of getting the union to agree to any arrangement that would allow the replacements to stay at work.</text>

            <text syncTime="2587.347" offset="10452720">The notice itself or several notices on May the 3rd, the company sent a letter to all its employees, strikers, and others, telling them that on May the 6th or 7th, they would begin to hire permanent replacements and that anybody who is replaced could have his job only to that point then he'd have no job.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.007" offset="10555434">Then they began to bargain with the union on the very first day they hired a replacement, suggesting different ways of handling this but not getting any where.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.884" offset="10590960">On May the 28th, they handed this so-called 20-year proposal to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.259" offset="10616456">The union, of course, rejected it along with everything else, but oddly enough on May the 30th, the union got on the television station and broadcast this all over Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.834" offset="10662745">The Company has -- had said this is confidential, we're trying to bargain on, but the union got on the television and said, “This is the company's policy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.384" offset="10696913">So on that day, the union broadcasted and then people did indeed began to come in, not by any announcement on our part, but by an announcement on the union's part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.625" offset="10741844">Finally, on June the 10th, a letter was sent out and published, saying that the policy had been adopted and on June the 15th, a notice was posted on the bulletin board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.400" offset="10792939">Those, I believe, are the notices concerning the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.416" offset="10809031">No special letter, which I am aware of, was sent to the strikers, but if the striker came in and said, “I want to go to work”, we said, you can go to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="2690.561" offset="10865664">In this respect, I should like to answer one other question that was asked, whether or not, this differs from offering say replacement, an additional 10 cents per hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.502" offset="10913416">Yes, it does in our view because offering a replacement an additional 10 cents per hour has nothing to do with his permanence of tenure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.121" offset="10959809">There is a vast difference between a permanent replacement and a strike breaker.</text>
