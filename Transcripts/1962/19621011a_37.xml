            <text syncTime="10.635" offset="145951">Mr. Teichner.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry Teichner</label>
            <text syncTime="13.237" offset="156296">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.448" offset="177194">This case presents the question whether the common law action for damages sustained by a shipper by reason of motor carrier misrouting of a shipment of goods has survived the passage of the Motor Carrier Act of 1935, which is part 2 of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.874" offset="270817">The general situation is not one of novel impression with this Court because this Court had occasion to go into the Motor Carrier Act to 1959 in a case entitled T.I.M.E. Incorporated against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.443" offset="357125">This is an action brought by a shipper of goods against a common carrier by motor vehicle to recover damages for a misrouting of its goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.310" offset="420655">During the years 1952 -- 1953 and 1954, the plaintiff in the action, the petitioner here delivered some goods, 350 shipments to the defendant, the respondent here, for transportation between Buffalo, New York and New York City, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.784" offset="550536">These goods consisted of foam rubber pads.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.551" offset="573628">The respondent motor carrier was certificated and had operating rights both interstate and intrastate between those two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.821" offset="654608">It had filed tariffs with the Interstate Commerce Commission for its intrastate route between Buffalo and New York and it had also filed tariffs with the Public Service Commission of the State of New York similarly for the transportation of that commodity wholly intrastate.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.336" offset="760665">Now, the rates that were filed for the interstate movement were higher than those for the intrastate movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.134" offset="807894">These shipments were tended unrouted to the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.210" offset="832240">The carrier chose to move these shipments via its higher rated interstate route instead of the cheaper intrastate route and the effect of that was that the petitioner had to pay $10,000 more for the movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.948" offset="947179">Thereupon, the petitioner instituted a suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking to recover the sum of $10,000 as damages for the misrouting of its shipments claiming that it had a right to have the carrier move the shipments via the cheapest route.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.437" offset="1073089">In its complaint, the petitioner requested that the determination of the action be held in abeyance pending the filing of a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission to have a determination as to whether or not the practice of the carrier was a reasonable one and to have a determination as to what were the reasonable rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.175" offset="1204120">The respondent filed an answer and in its answer, set up as one of its defenses that it could not transport these shipments over the lower rated intrastate route because of certain difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.628" offset="1281860">Thereupon, I filed the complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission and I set forth the facts and I asked for a determination as to what were the reasonable rates and what would a reasonable practice under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.641" offset="1345912">In other words, I sought from the Commission, a determination as to whether or not the intrastate route was a reasonable one or whether it was an unreasonable one.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.838" offset="1414771">The action of the District Court was held in abeyance and a full hearing was had before the Interstate Commerce Commission on that administrative issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.973" offset="1467225">The Interstate Commerce Commission made a decision and held that the intrastate route was a wholly feasible route and that the carrier should have moved these shipments over the intrastate route so that the shipper could have had the benefit of the lower rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.153" offset="1583940">Now, when that decision came down, the carrier felt aggrieved and thereupon instituted a suit in the District Court of New Jersey against the United States of America and against the Interstate Commerce Commission and asked for an annulment of the Commission's decision on the ground that it was not supported by the evidence or record.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.347" offset="1708805">That suit was tried in the District Court of New Jersey, but before the court made a decision and while the action was still pending in the District Court of New York, this Court decided the T.I.M.E. case.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.512" offset="1797413">Now in the T.I.M.E. case, this Court decided that a shipper of goods by a certificated motor carrier cannot challenge in post-shipment litigation, the reasonableness of the carrier's charges which were made in accordance with the tariff governing the shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.539" offset="1889573">Thereupon, the carrier made a motion in the District Court of New York in this action for summary judgment on the theory that the T.I.M.E. case was authority for a dismissal of the complaint on the ground that a justiciable issue was not presented upon which relief could be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.200" offset="2004198">That motion was granted and Judge Bicks, District Court Judge Bicks who wrote the opinion in the matter, stated that in view of the fact that a referral to the Commission was necessary on the administrative issue as to the reasonableness of the intrastate route, therefore, the Interstate Commerce Commission had no jurisdiction in the matter and the District Court had no jurisdiction of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.833" offset="2146722">An appeal was taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.774" offset="2170441">That court affirmed, Judge Moore dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.576" offset="2197713">The majority of the Court likewise felt that T.I.M.E. compelled a dismissal of the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.124" offset="2263855">It is our position that T.I.M.E. does not authorize a dismissal of the complaint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.549" offset="2309517">We contend that T.I.M.E. merely went to the question as to whether or not intrinsic reasonableness has an issue on the case would prevent the Interstate Commerce Commission from taking jurisdiction as well as the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.898" offset="2414947">A case involving simpleness routing does not involve intrinsic unreasonableness of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.689" offset="2458102">The reason that it is conceded for the purposes of the suit that each one of the rates, the interstate as well as the intrastate rate is a applicable rate to each one of those movements and that it is a reasonable rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.211" offset="2560188">The only complaint is that the carrier committed wrong in transporting these shipments over a higher rated route when a lower rated route was available --excuse me.</text>

            <text syncTime="675.519" offset="2805426">So that, we have a situation where a motor carrier has committed a common law wrong in exacting a charge for a transportation of shipments of goods when the shipments were tendered unrouted to them and they have the obligation of giving the shipper the cheapest route.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.983" offset="2915349">That is a traditional misrouting case in the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.971" offset="2943248">The question here is whether or not the Motor Carrier Act abolished such action.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.717" offset="2974281">We contend that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.677" offset="2986088">We see nothing in the legislative history for the Motor Carrier Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.440" offset="3005106">We see nothing in the act itself that proscribes an action for motor carrier misrouting.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.762" offset="3038438">It is a simple wrong that was committed by the motor carrier for which it should respond in damages to the shipper.</text>

            <text syncTime="848.670" offset="3498088">Well, the Jersey Court was asked to hold in abeyance its decision until this Court decides this matter because there too, the question arises as to whether or not the Interstate Commerce Commission has any jurisdiction on the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.932" offset="3571127">And of course, if it should be found that the Interstate Commerce Commission does not have jurisdiction then the United States and Interstate Commerce Commission will fail in that case and the order of the Commission will be annulled.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.009" offset="3639359">Now, there are cases of misrouting where it is not at all necessary to go to the Commission for an administrative finding and this would be a case of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.621" offset="3685857">Let us assume that a carrier has two routes between the same points, one is a higher rated route than the other one and the motor carrier thereupon, transports the shipment over the higher rated route, and a suit is instituted to recover damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.466" offset="3785226">If there is no question at all about the reasonableness of the intrastate route or the lower rated route, then of course there is no question at all to present to the Interstate Commerce Commission and under those circumstances, the court in which the action is brought may determine all the issues on the case, and we then have a simple common law case.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.144" offset="3895986">That is one the differences between a case of a misrouting and a case where rates are attacked as being intrinsically unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.424" offset="3945096">In the latter case, it is necessary at all times to refer the matter of reasonableness to the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.601" offset="3989817">However, in a case of motor carrier misrouting or rail carrier misrouting, there is no necessity of referring the matter to the Interstate Commerce Commission in case no issue is raised with respect to the reasonableness of the lower rated route.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.121" offset="4063901">Now, one of the factors for example that may be involved in determining whether or not a lower rated route is reasonable would be road conditions, whether the route conditions are such, that we cannot reasonably expect a carrier to transport the shipment over such route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.964" offset="4155225">Absent such question, the Interstate Commerce Commission would not be resorted to at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.251" offset="4184377">That is one of the differences between misrouting and the T.I.M.E. case which involved merely intrinsic unreasonableness of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.445" offset="4237145">Now, there is another distinction and it is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.442" offset="4285106">In the T.I.M.E. case, this Court held that a shipper has a built-in protection granted it by the Motor Carrier Act with respect to the reasonableness of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.936" offset="4363160">It is incumbent upon an interstate motor carrier to file a tariff of its rates with the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.910" offset="4399000">As soon as the carrier does so, any member of the shipping public can come in and attack those rates and say that they are unreasonable and they prove that they are unreasonable.</text>

            <label>Mr. Wilfred R. Caron</label>
            <text syncTime="1373.036" offset="5595512">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.834" offset="5606693">The petitioner's brief and to some extent petitioner’s argument has created by either inadvertence or intention, the impression that there was deliberate misconduct on the part of the carrier, respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.919" offset="5679000">And so in view of that, I would like to clarify the facts insofar as they help to narrow the conduct involved and what has been done here which is assailed as improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.072" offset="5739708">First of all, the complaint merely refers to the routing practice as unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.316" offset="5768652">It does not allege that it was willfully done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.680" offset="5782131">It does not allege that it was deliberate or that it was discriminatory at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.687" offset="5810134">We simply charged a rate that was in accordance with the filed tariff and which applied to the route that was actually used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.262" offset="5856423">Now, a reference might be made for a moment to the report of the Commission, Division III which decided that the routing practice in question was not reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.896" offset="5902921">First of all, the examiner that made his report to the Division recommended that the charge of unreasonableness was unsound and should be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.337" offset="5948688">However, the Division did not agree with that and by a 2 to 1 decision found that it was unreasonable under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.235" offset="5984319">Now, what was unreasonable?</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.880" offset="5990902">Well, first of all, let’s consider the routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.149" offset="6007933">The interstate route was 385 miles long or 12 miles shorter than the intrastate route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.707" offset="6050252">There is a quote in my adversary's brief about routing shipments around Robin Hood's barn but that really didn’t happen at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.746" offset="6090376">Actually, the intrastate route was 3.1% longer, although it did involve a lower rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.929" offset="6123081">Now, the selection of the route again as disclosed and discussed in the ICC report, was based on matters so far as the carrier was concerned of practicability and economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.717" offset="6178252">It was the feeling of the company that the shipment could not be practicably handled intrastate and there were reasons given for that, the size of the vehicles, the fact that there were less than truck load shipments which had to be broken down in a terminal and so it used the interstate route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.628" offset="6261844">One of the Commissioners dissented on the ground and by the way this is before T.I.M.E. on the ground that it had no jurisdiction to decide the issue of reasonableness of past routing practices.</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.074" offset="6771649">If it is not reasonable or practicable, then of course the carrier cannot do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.567" offset="6793592">So far as I understand the law, there is no right on the part of the carrier arbitrarily to refuse, to pursue a designated route specified by the shipper.</text>

            <text syncTime="2702.646" offset="10913938">Mr. Chief Justice, I think it was the concluding paragraph of the majority opinion in T.I.M.E. which adverted to the malice we have just discussed whether or not the shipper would have a right to attack the rate as being unreasonable anti shipment and at the time when the rate was first proposed to be put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.291" offset="11008502">With respect to this matter as to whether or not, a shipper by motor carrier has a right to designate the route.</text>

            <text syncTime="2772.082" offset="11191672">Now, there is no such -- no counterpart of that provision in part two with respect to motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.896" offset="11226990">And the Interstate Commerce Commission in its decision in the case that we have at bar stated the following, “Misrouting is an unreasonable practice violative of the provisions of Section 216 (b) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.266" offset="11308387">And while a motor carrier must under Section 217 (b) of the Act observe its tariff rates over the route of movement, it also must observe just and reasonable routing practices.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.190" offset="11364080">This duty is not affected by the absence from part two of the Act of any specific grant to shippers of the right to designate routes by which their property shall be transported.</text>

            <text syncTime="2863.228" offset="11556237">In other words, we have in part two a specific grant to a shipper of a right to route his own shipments and to that direction must be observed and obeyed by the rail carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.000" offset="11627395">And as the ICC points out, part two of the Act does not give such specific grant to a shipper by motor carrier, the inference being that under those circumstances, a shipper by motor carrier would not have a right to specifically route a shipment with respect to movements by motor vehicle.</text>
