            <text syncTime="71.756" offset="390353">This case is on a direct appeal from a judgment of the District Court for the Southern District of New York dismissing after trial, a Government antitrust case against the Singer Manufacturing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.094" offset="443747">The District Court concluded that the Government had failed to prove the existence of the conspiracy charge and of the Government’s other contention with respect to a certain agreement is being an unreasonable restraint of trade have not been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.475" offset="501321">The principal question in the case is whether certain actions taken by the appellee, Singer and a competing Swiss manufacturer of sewing machines, a company called Gegauf, by which a key patent governing the particular type of machine involved here was transferred from the Swiss company Gegauf to the Singer Company because both parties believed that Singer would be better able to enforce this patent against the common competitive enemy of both, Japanese manufacturers of sewing machines that was selling them in this country for lower prices, whether this, together with subsequent action that the two took to enforce the patent, a matter to an illegal conspiracy and combination and restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.476" offset="709256">There's a second issue in the case which is whether a provision in the cross-licensing agreement that Singer and the Swiss firm, Gegauf entered into by which each party agreed to facilitate the allowance to the other of the broadest possible patent claims, its self-constituted and unreasonable restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.741" offset="794311">Now, this case involves a particular type of household sewing machines, something called the machine-carried multiple cam zigzag machine.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.848" offset="1426787">And finally, the reason we're not attacking it here is we don't think there's anything in the record that establishes that the agreement with Vigorelli in anyway related to an attempt to exclude the Japanese competitors.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.549" offset="1629602">At the point that Singer entered into the cross-licensing agreements, both with Vigorelli and with Gegauf, at this point Singer was concerned that the machine which it had been developing might be infringing these patents and it wanted to free itself from the threat of being an infringer.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.530" offset="1709537">It was, if I may use the phrase, this was a defensive alliance, an attempt to protect themselves so they could make their own machine, but when you get to the situation which forms the guts, if I may say, of this case, Singer shifted from the defensive to the offensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.800" offset="1774529">Singer then begun its campaign not to ensure itself protection that it could manufacture free of the threat of infringement by Gegauf but it begun this -- went -- entered into this joint program we think with Gegauf, to enable it to exclude its competitors.</text>

            <text syncTime="589.427" offset="2461132">The Court will notice that there is on this side of the device a series of metal discs or cams, and the outside of each one of these has different protrusions of different sizes and different shapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.545" offset="2513586">There's also attached to this a little finger-like called a cam follower which can be moved from one cam to the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.902" offset="2542947">As this revolves, the cam follower bounces back and forth following the configurations of the cam.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.111" offset="2575862">And this movement is transmitted by a mechanism to the needle.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.413" offset="2592998">And the result of this is that as the cam goes around and it's transmitted, the needle, while it's going up and down at the same time is moving laterally back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.195" offset="2640123">And that's how the zigzag stitches are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.002" offset="2647333">It goes in effect like this, up and down.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.038" offset="2659558">And the beauty of this device is this machine carried the cams, all being together here that the housewife may select a large variety of patterns by the simple expedient of turning dials and selecting one cam or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.352" offset="2736776">And there shall here before the Court, this is a model of the machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.675" offset="2758092">The cams are in here and now they can see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.965" offset="2779199">In here, it's transmitted to the needle here which goes up and down, and with zigzags from side to side laterally as the cloth is going through.</text>

            <text syncTime="692.156" offset="2871986">With one -- with one minor exemption, yes and this particular type of machine in the year 1959 represented about 45% of Singer's total sales of household sewing machines in the United States, roughly about $45 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.145" offset="2947950">Now, before turning to the facts, I would like to discuss one matter which in a sense is lurking in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.698" offset="2986193">Singer makes a great deal of the fact that in the sewing machine industry, the Japanese manufacturers have made a remarkable achievement in getting into the American market.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.195" offset="3048155">It points out that the Japanese have been vigorous competitors, that they have now gained a major share of the American market.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.780" offset="3078457">That they are undercutting prices and that other manufacturers in America of sewing machines are going out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.625" offset="3105834">And from these facts, Singer suggests that what it did was permissible here because it was done to protect an American industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.317" offset="3144600">As it puts it in these circumstances, any restraint it imposes is not an unreasonable restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.212" offset="3172185">We think that the answer to this is that the antitrust laws do not permit American manufacturer to justify, otherwise illegal conduct because of the fact that this is done to protect it from foreign competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.780" offset="3246477">The Sherman Act permits as designed to protect both domestic and foreign competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.071" offset="3271659">And if in fact, as a matter of national policy, it is considered desirable that some steps should be taken in order to protect this American industry from foreign competition, this is not the way to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.394" offset="3344906">There are other ways to deal with this problem, particularly under the Tariff Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.836" offset="3362670">It may also be dealt with -- through international agreements doing action by the Executive branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.534" offset="3385553">But we don't think the fact that the lower priced Japanese machines are making serious inroads into business of the American companies, justifies in any way what Singer has done in this case in an attempt to proceed and to stop this competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="879.081" offset="3619715">If Singer is able to undersell the Japanese firm, if Singer can manufacture a better machine, the customers feel that despite their higher prices, they prefer the Singer machine as this time, we do say that this American company and its Swiss competitor cannot enter into a joint course of dealing for the purpose of using their combined power against the Japanese.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.809" offset="3710621">Now the -- I like now to turn to the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.165" offset="3723995">The story that we are going to tell basically fits into three phases.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.746" offset="3746356">The first phase involves the cross-licensing agreement between Singer and Gegauf.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.320" offset="3768613">The second phase involves the transfer of the patent from Gegauf to Singer and the third phase involves certain actions the parties took after the transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.541" offset="3809573">The background of the case is just quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.702" offset="3826186">In late 1955 and early 1956, Singer Company had pending before the United States Patent Office an application basically the four gadgets that I've shown the Court earlier covering machine-carried multiple cams which it hoped would be granted and which will protect this machine which had already developed and which was then in the process of towing up to manufacture.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.014" offset="3935378">In 1955, it had settled certain patent disputes with the Italian firm, Vigorelli, by entering into a cross-licensing with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.397" offset="3972995">And it had reason to believe that its patent application which is known as the Harris patent would have priority in the United States over the applications filed by other manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.191" offset="4024090">In January 1956, it learned to its great consternation that the Gegauf Company had on file a patent application in the United States which had a priority date, nine days earlier than the Singer application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.211" offset="4104234">And it was of the view that if this matter came to a head, the chances are that Gegauf would prevail over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.225" offset="4140283">It was afraid that -- it was informed that its application was ready for issuance and it was afraid that when the patent office came to examine its application preliminary to issuance, they would quickly discover that the Gegauf patent was also pending, covering the same invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.554" offset="4209560">And that they would then be what the Patent Office describes as an interference proceeding which is a proceeding by which the Patent Office determines which of two competing applicants for a patent claim is the first inventor and therefore entitled to the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.211" offset="4268178">And it was afraid as I've indicated that it would come out second best in this conflict with Gegauf.</text>

            <text syncTime="1101.732" offset="4510281">The second in the sum -- I'm sorry, in the second volume.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.052" offset="4527626">It's Government Exhibit 24 and it's this first full paragraph on page 1062 in volume 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.048" offset="4575587">Mr. Waterman said, Gegauf's big fear is that the Japanese machines coming into the United States will be sold at a lower price than his machines will be because of their low price labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.478" offset="4629295">I think its fear is well founded and we did not do anything to cause them to be other than along the line that he was thinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.932" offset="4659075">Because one of the strong points of our argument for an agreement between our two companies is in order to fight against this Japanese competition and they're building a machine that in anyway reads on the patents of ourselves and of Bernina and Bernina, I might add is the trade name for Gegauf which are in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.968" offset="4743293">In other words, he emphasized that the purpose of the agreement was in order to fight against this Japanese competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.084" offset="4767744">Then down at the bottom of page 1063 in the top of 1064, Mr. Waterman also told them that Singer was prepared to fight with them, they're going to litigate with them if they didn't reach an agreement and as he said that, we left them no doubt that we're going to offer objection to the issuance of their patents, not only in the United States but in other countries where they have pending applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.383" offset="4848933">And we let them know that we thought we could knockout their claims, but then in so doing we were probably going to get hurt both of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.391" offset="4888952">The result of this was the cross-licensing agreement which is set forth in the following two pages of the record 1066 and 1067.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.483" offset="4925315">The actual cross-licensing agreement itself which we are not attacking is set forth in paragraphs two and three, and it took the form of an agreement by Singer and Gegauf not to attack each other on the basis of the patents listed in the agreement, which included the Gegauf patent application to Harris and certain others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.836" offset="5014758">In addition to that, and we are attacking paragraph one of the agreement, contains two sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.024" offset="5043493">In the first one, Singer and Gegauf agreed not to do anything, which might restrict each other's claims in any country relating to the subject matter of these patent applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.213" offset="5088214">And the second paragraph, each undertook in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Patent Office concerned to facilitate the allowance in any country of claims as broad as possible as regards the subject matter of the patents and patent application referred to above, in other words, not just these particular patents but the subject matter, the whole subject matter of this machine-carried multiple cams.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.776" offset="5198451">Now, at the time this agreement to facilitate the allowance to the broadest possible claims was entered into, Singer and Gegauf, as far as this patent is concerned, were merely applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.639" offset="5249964">They didn't have this patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.516" offset="5257488">At this time, the Japanese of course were not infringers of any patent and Singer, Gegauf and the Japanese all had the equal right to sell this machine in the United States until any patent issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.024" offset="5311509">Necessarily, any broad patent which would issue, as a result of this agreement, would define the scope of what conduct the competing Japanese might engage and the broader of the patent, the greater the likelihood of course that more and more of the Japanese machines would turn out to infringe this patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.109" offset="5403773">And the agreements that they made to help each other in obtaining broad patents, we think, must be considered in the light of the statement which I have just read to the Court, that the reason -- one reason for this agreement was to fight against the Japanese competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.271" offset="5468453">Now, we think that the purpose of this provision is very plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.672" offset="5482036">Each of these people was concerned about the Japanese competition they wanted to insure that one or both of them would get the broadest possible patent which would be the most effective method for opposing the Japanese.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.426" offset="5537102">Now, at the time the that Singer entered into the cross-licensing agreement, the record shows that it gave consideration to purchasing the Gegauf patent, decided not to do it, however, for various business reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.266" offset="5596453">The following week, Singer met with Vigorelli with whom it had entered into a cross-licensing the year before and they had a conversation with Vigorelli's lawyer, who asked them what the patent situation was in the United States and they told Vigorelli that they'd entered into this cross-licensing agreement but they're going to have a terrible time they thought Gegauf would have a hard time enforcing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.254" offset="5692374">And they indicated to Vigorelli's lawyer that they thought they could do a better job in enforcing this patent and Gegauf could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.716" offset="5722258">Vigorelli's lawyer asked whether they would have any objection to passing this information on to Gegauf, Singer replied he wouldn't but they wanted to be sure it didn't appear that it was coming from Singer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.358" offset="5764786">And Vigorelli's man said, “Don't worry about that” and this information was passed on to Gegauf.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.456" offset="5801148">That was in the Spring of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.024" offset="5819434">That summer, Mr. Gegauf's son came to the United States on a visit and Singer had a conference with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.213" offset="5852244">And young Mr. Gegauf expressed to Singer his concern that he had seen a great many Japanese sewing machines in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.940" offset="5887143">Singer in turn pointed out to young Mr. Gegauf that in view of the large number of importers, it would be very difficult for Gegauf to enforce this patent effectively against these Japanese machines and he asked -- Singer people asked young Gegauf whether he thought his father would be interested in selling the patent to Singer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.124" offset="5975855">That was in the summer of 1956. Early in September, Gegauf wrote to Singer in response to this suggestion, and this letter is set forth at page 1079 of the record again in volume 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.361" offset="6032802">It's a short one page letter marked “confidential” in which after thanking the Singer Company for the courtesies they had shown to Mr. Gegauf, the last paragraph, Gegauf stated, “We agree that something should be done against Japanese competition in your country and maybe South America and therefore looking forward to your early reply.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.876" offset="6118902">Within two days, Gegauf indicated that this was what they had in mind in the next page of the record at 1080, Singer replied -- I'm sorry, Singer replied to Gegauf, “We do believe it may be possible that we can both strengthen our positions with respect to the Japanese competition which you mention and I hope that we can again meet and discuss our respective situations.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1932.051" offset="7831594">I'd like to just refer to the basis, to the arguments, the way in which Singer was able to persuade Gegauf to sell the patent to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.308" offset="7880600">We start with a year after they had held their first meeting in October at which Singer was unwilling to pay the $250,000 that Gegauf had requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.993" offset="7927306">There was a series of letters in which suggesting that now -- that the Gegauf patent had issued -- I'm sorry, now that the patents were about to be issued and that the interference had been settled, it would be appropriate to discuss mutual enforcement of the patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.271" offset="7992508">And throughout these discussions, the argument that Singer made against the transfer and in -- I'm sorry, the argument that Gegauf made, against the transfer and in support of its high price was two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.164" offset="8060008">First, it said, “We can get a lot more than the $125,000 we're asking by licensing this patent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.613" offset="8093863">Singer's reply to that was, “Don't look at this as though -- treat this as though this is just the money you're getting out of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.605" offset="8121762">Look at this as insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.098" offset="8127718">Look at what we're doing for you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.006" offset="8135346">Secondly, Gegauf suggested that if Singer did get the patent and that if Singer did enforce it against the Japanese in the United States, all that this would do, would be to drive the Japanese to Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.182" offset="8200129">And that in Europe, this would be down to Gegauf's detriment and Singer against it on the contrary, on the contrary, we will be able to give the Japanese such a blow in this country by enforcing our patent against them, you won't have to worry about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.701" offset="8266167">And as the District Court found in this case that Singer continued to drive home the point that Gegauf stood to benefit more by enforcement of the patents in the United States and it stood to lose because the possible danger of the Japanese coming to Europe and the sale was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.304" offset="8340564">Now, we think that when these negotiations are looked at in the light of the undisputed documentary evidence and what the Court found, several things are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.089" offset="8387688">First, there can be no doubt that Gegauf was induced to sell the patent to Singer and at this price below what they were asking because Singer convinced Gegauf that Singer would be better able to enforce this patent against the Japanese than Gegauf and it was to the mutual interest of both of them that Singer should do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.286" offset="8484551">It's also we think quite clear that even though there was no expressed agreement by Singer to enforce the patent against Gegauf that both of them understood that this was precisely what was going to be done, there was no need to enter into any agreement on the part of them that Singer would enforce the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.401" offset="8560933">This was the reason that Singer made quite clear they wanted to purchase the patent and this was the argument it used in inducing Gegauf to sell it to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2188.013" offset="8855385">And when Gegauf found out about it, it wrote to Singer complaining because they said, “Why did you license this other German firm, maybe Sears would have taken from us, you should have given us the opportunity to get that.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2204.820" offset="8922676">I don't think there was -- had been any agreement for breach of contract they would have at length but it certainly violates the whole spirit of the relationship between them and the purpose which they entered into this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.302" offset="8968547">I'd like also to invite the Court's attention to a letter that Gegauf wrote to Singer in the summer of 1958 at page 1128.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.789" offset="9014523">This was after the patent had been assigned after it had issued and after Singer had brought the first infringement suit against the Japanese.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.492" offset="9073351">And in this letter, Gegauf in telling about some discussions he had with the firm called Pfaff, which had been allowed to be licensed under the assignment agreement said about the next to the last paragraph, halfway down, in these discussions with Pfaff, “I did not mention of course that you intend to proceed against the Japanese on the basis of your patents and ours, what happened already in the meantime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.628" offset="9173870">According to my opinion, the Japanese can be hit only if we succeed in preventing them manufacture of certain machines for reasons of patent rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.504" offset="9213367">I said if we succeed, once again, this letter we think clearly and it shows that Gegauf was aware that Singer was planning to institute these proceedings against the Japanese, that it view itself participating in this campaign and then it was see -- saw the whole thing as a joint program, the design to protect them against the Japanese.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.661" offset="9306049">Now, the assignment of the patent to Gegauf to -- I'm sorry by Gegauf to Singer, was not the end of the joint cooperative endeavors of this parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.784" offset="9358503">After the patent was issued to Singer in the summer of 1958, so I've indicated Singer brought an infringement suit against the principal Japanese manufacturer which is still pending and in January of 1959, it filed a complaint with the Tariff Commission under Section 337 of the Tariff Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.033" offset="9435512">That's the provision of the Tariff Act which permits the Tariff Commission to recommend to the President and the President to bar imports into this country where the importation of articles in commerce results in unfair competition or in unfair acts to the detriment which will result in destroying or substantially eliminating an industry efficiently operated in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.715" offset="9546271">The purpose of this proceeding, the complaint before the Tariff Commission, requested the President to issue an order barring from the United States all infringing machines which violated the so-called Gegauf patent which Singer now had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.099" offset="9607816">And while it's true that it sought relief against all infringing machines which under the theory of the case would have to do before the statute, the District Court found that in bringing this proceeding, Singer had been motivated by the deluge of infringing Japanese imports and that the principal threat of Japanese machines came from the Japanese import -- I'm sorry, principal threat to the Singer machine came from the Japanese imports and not from European production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.645" offset="9717948">Now, during the course of this proceeding, the Tariff Commission raised the question with Singer whether in view of the provision in the agreement for the transfer of the patent which reserved to Gegauf the right to license this German firm Pfaff, whether in fact Pfaff had been licensed because the Tariff Commission takes the position it will not direct exclusion of a foreign product if in fact the American manufacturer is permitting licenses under the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.915" offset="9851068">Singer told that it hadn't been, but Singer was afraid that this answer was not convincing to the Tariff Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.193" offset="9876146">So Singer wrote to Gegauf saying that the only way they could satisfy the Tariff Commission, that there had been no license to Gegauf, was to delete Gegauf's name from the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.325" offset="9932675">Gegauf wrote -- I'm sorry, to delete Pfaff's name from the agreement, Gegauf wrote back that it was agreeable to help Singer as much as possible in its fight in the United States, imposed a condition that wanted a certain guarantee of immunity from Singer, which Singer reluctantly gave them and then the agreement was signed deleting the reference to Pfaff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.017" offset="10039463">And the last document I'd like to refer the Court to, is at page 1206 of the record, paragraph number four of that document.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.755" offset="10082408">This was an affidavit which Gegauf executed contemporaneously with the signature of the agreement, which deleted Pfaff's name from the assignment and it shows we think beyond any question that Gegauf and Pfaff was still -- Gegauf and Singer were still cooperating in this campaign against the Japanese.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.107" offset="10163806">To read -- the language reads, “at the request of Singer and for helping them in their fight on the United States market against foreign competitors, I have today signed this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.745" offset="10218350">” Now, I've indic -- already indicated our basic theory of the case on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.163" offset="10239979">The Sherman Act requires that each competitor compete on his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.765" offset="10262444">The competitors cannot join hands, cannot combine forces against a common enemy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.926" offset="10287104">I think this Court put it very well in a somewhat different context in the Associated Press case when it stated that the Sherman Act was specifically intended to prohibit independent businessmen from becoming associates in a common plan which is bound to reduce their competitor's opportunity to buy or sell the things in which the groups compete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.104" offset="10375816">This principle -- this basic principle of the Sherman Act, that a competitor must act individually, was applied by the District Court in the National Lead case to hold that competitors cannot agree with each other not to license under their patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.224" offset="10432240">And we think that in this very case, the same principle requires the conclusion the when you have two competitors and have a common enemy, one competitor cannot transfer the patent by agreement with the other where the reason for the transfer is because the other competitor is better able to enforce it than the first against their common enemy and thereafter the two continue to cooperate in this joint campaign.</text>

            <text syncTime="3093.938" offset="12479091">We don't contest the validity of agreement not to -- well, I think it depends on the circumstances which I'd like to come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.339" offset="12508766">In the normal practice in an interference proceeding is after an examiner has determined that the claim which is sought is patentable, a preliminary investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.313" offset="12552652">He then searches the file to see if any other claims are on issue for the same invention and if he concludes that two inventors have claims pending the matter is put it into interference and the purpose of the interference proceeding is to determine who is the first inventor and entitled to the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.152" offset="12631960">Now, if there's no issue as to the validity of the patents as to their scope, there's obviously no strong public interest in determining which of the two inventors gets it and indeed in that kind of situation, it's in the public interest we think to settle these disputes before the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.216" offset="12704266">But under the practice before the Patent Office, when an interference is declared, the junior applicant for the patent not only may attempt to show that the senior claimant, the one who has filed first has in fact -- in fact is not the inventor, he may attempt to attack the patent of the senior claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.774" offset="12794441">He can contend that the patent is too broad or he can contend that it's invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.214" offset="12816280">Now, the significance of the latter is two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.907" offset="12827042">From his point of view, this means, if he doesn't think he can prove he is the inventor, if the patent is invalid he at least can prevent the man who has priority of invention in keeping him from patenting the invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.573" offset="12877615">But from the point of view of the public interest, this is far more important because this is one of the few checks that exist under our Patent Office procedure against the issuance of unduly broad or invalid patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.734" offset="12934353">Most Patent Office procedures are ex parte.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.100" offset="12943757">The Patent Offices that are well-known, the patent examiners unfortunately are over worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.300" offset="12968521">They do the best job they can, but I think the Court knows that the very large number of patents that after preliminary inquiry had been issued by the Patent Office have been subsequently invalidated by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.962" offset="13027244">Now, in this case, we think that when parties to a proceeding before the Patent Office, at a time when the interference hasn't even been declared, get together and agree that they will facilitate and help each other in obtaining the broadest possible claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.934" offset="13111150">And I'm not saying parenthetically there is a question in this case as to the District Court held that the only provision which applies in the United States is the second sentence of the first paragraph which I think my adversary is going to stress and the first one doesn't but we don't think this makes any difference because we think that an agreement to facilitate the allowance of the broadest possible claims necessarily also covers the obligation in the first sentence of not restricting the claims of the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.280" offset="13228492">And I will -- I will just also mention in passing because he may stress this that they made a claim that we have waived any attack on the first -- second sentence of the first paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.517" offset="13269452">We deal with that in our brief, but let me come back to the thing that we think is the basic vice in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.067" offset="13295679">When you have an agreement by which two applicants before the Patent Office, two people whose claims are pending and where the interference hasn't even been declared and they agree with each other that each will facilitate the allowance of the broadest possible claims to each other, this necessarily can lead to the issuance of broad claims that are illegal and I think I can demonstrate this graphic dramatically by the very facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.290" offset="13400482">Let met tell the Court what happened; at the time that this agreement was entered into, the Patent Office had notified both of the parties that the claim of each of them was ready for interference and suggested a particular wording of a claim, this is the Patent Office practice for interference between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.046" offset="13487522">Each of them had accepted the claim and this is obviously the claim they had reference to when they stated -- recited in the agreement that interference proceedings were about to open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.431" offset="13529109">After the agreement was entered into, two weeks afterwards, the Patent Office itself advised these people that the claim that the Patent Office had proposed was too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.050" offset="13571532">It was too broad because the Patent Office had discovered an earlier patent which in fact covered this invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.227" offset="13604237">An earlier patent, it had not previously discovered that it had been issued in 1912 and what the Patent Office did and said in view this earlier patent, we now suggest a much narrow -- a narrower claim which the parties then accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.585" offset="13661706">Now, if the Patent Office had not had the good fortune to turn up this 1912 patent in its search, the inevitable effect of this agreement is that this invalid patent would presumably have issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.346" offset="13720743">This Court stated in the Precision Instrument case that applicants before the Patent Office have an uncompromising duty to report to it all facts concerning possible fraud or inequitableness underlying the applications and issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.793" offset="13782497">And we think it's a violation of that uncompromising duty when two applicants for a patent whose claims have not even put in interference, agree at the outset that they will do everything to facilitate the allowance of the broadest possible claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3495.111" offset="14083845">I like to stress at the very beginning that it involves fundamentally one thing and one thing only and that is the acquisition and enforcement by Singer, Gegauf patent number one, a patent which covered machine which it invented, developed, manufactured and sold and there is no other element that's involved here now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.348" offset="14192724">This case started out and the Government started it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.068" offset="14207666">It alleged that there were of course agreements and understandings outside of the written agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.927" offset="14235042">It alleged that these agreements and understandings were made to Vigorelli and Gegauf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.199" offset="14268165">It alleged that the agreements were to have transferred from Gegauf, two Gegauf patents to be used in combination with three Singer patents against the Japanese and the Japanese only and there was a complete pooling charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="3567.467" offset="14373282">The trial court found and after, you can see a very extensive examination, that there was no agreement or conspiracy of any kind, no agreement or understanding made in connection with anyone of the three acquaintances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.497" offset="14433364">It was not as counsel stated that the trial court found that merely in connection with the assignment agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3599.341" offset="14500760">In each instance separately, it found that there was no understanding or agreement of any kind between Gegauf and Singer as to the use of the patent, whether it would be licensed, whether it would be enforced or anything whatever to do with Singer's use of the patent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3628.135" offset="14615907">The counsel before the trial court occupied at least 19 sessions and I think more in pre -- pre-trial conferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.872" offset="14658853">It sat in on the drawing of stipulation which occupies a very substantial number of pages in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.656" offset="14686020">The counsel marked at the directions of the court, every single letter and submitted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.969" offset="14715277">They crossed mark them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.330" offset="14724681">Government counsel marked in red, defense counsel marked in blue, every single line that was considered significant by either party in any document.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.331" offset="14772746">Those documents were submitted to the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.225" offset="14784240">They were argued for nine days and I can assure you there's no significance that any counsel connected with the case thought there was in any of those documents that was not called to the attention of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.220" offset="14840247">There's been probably as exhaustive and as careful an analysis of all the documents, as it's possible for a trial court to give to a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.196" offset="14892178">It had also before it the testimony of the chief and principal negotiator who attended every conference who is not Mr. Waterman as stated by Mr. Friedman but was Mr. Stanford, a counsel and a patent counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.700" offset="14950170">He attended every single conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.978" offset="14959261">He was on the stand for a large number of days and was cross -- cross-examined handling by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.758" offset="14998444">On the basis of all these testimony and of all of this experience, the trial court found not only that there was no agreement and no conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.841" offset="15054764">It used the word that it had no significance except respect to the depth of its feeling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.040" offset="15079528">Having found in several occasions before that there was no agreement of any kind and no understanding it came to a point later where the Government is trying to relate a provision in the agreement to an underlying conspiracy to pool patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.275" offset="15140446">The trial court said, “This is probably the fourth time it came to it, we have before found that there absolutely was no agreement or conspiracy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.168" offset="15184018">Now, obviously, it absolutely doesn't add much except as a matter of feeling because if there was no agreement or no conspiracy, there was none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.859" offset="15214843">But when the trial court in this opinion after stating several times, says, “Absolutely, no agreement or no conspiracy”, you know the intensity of his feeling with reference to all of this testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.429" offset="15265102">I do not deem that it's possible to read the record in this case or read the statement of facts that we prepared without coming to the same conclusion because there just literally is nothing to the Government's case in any respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.396" offset="15324975">Our -- I'm sorry that our brief is so long but after all this phase covered a period of four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.691" offset="15362173">It involved not only the three contracts between Singer and Gegauf, it involved a cross-license agreement with Vigorelli, with Mr. Smith, license agreement with Sears and many other agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.761" offset="15414418">All of these had to be gone into in addition to many other considerations for the purpose of determining the attitude, purpose, intent of these parties in dealing throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.534" offset="15465514">Now, the Government would have you believe that the trial court was under the impression that if it found that there was no agreement, that that settled the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.452" offset="15505220">Then we'd have another Parke-Davis case where the trial court was under the impression that if there was not an agreement, it settled it, and there could be no conspiracy and no combination without it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.012" offset="15551404">The trial court to the contrary, went into every single argument that the Government put up, trying to show that even outside of the agreement, there were a -- or was a what you would call a combination or a conspiracy between these two parties to get to a particular result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.811" offset="15638653">The court spent pages on it and you can find it and I can cite in the reference to 1693 and 1694, 1705 to 1740, are literally pages of the Court's opinion dealing with various facts that the Government raised in trying to show that there was a concerted action, unity of purpose, common design.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.079" offset="15727679">There was hardly any combination of words that could be used, that the Government didn't use in this case because it soon found that it was hopeless to find any agreement, whatever, between Singer and Gegauf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3919.231" offset="15780342">The trial court made the very express finding that there was no common purpose and no unity of purpose here, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.252" offset="15816391">And it found that the sole purpose and Singer's sole interest in acquiring this patent was to protect its own product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.862" offset="15850872">Now, if I may just add one word so we could bear with it and I want to point out that nothing is involved in -- with respect to the restraint of any trade whatever other than a sewing machine that infringes Gegauf patent number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.048" offset="15923597">There's no -- there's no argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.947" offset="15931120">There's need no allegation now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.607" offset="15937808">There's no contention, whatever, that the purpose was to exclude other machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.145" offset="15963930">The phrase has been used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.616" offset="15969886">They use it through their brief frequently, Japanese competitors, but when it's analyzed, it is always in reference to Japanese competitors selling infringed sewing machines.</text>
