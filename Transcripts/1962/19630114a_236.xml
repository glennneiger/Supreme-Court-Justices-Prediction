            <label>Mr. Edward J. Davis</label>
            <text syncTime="34.205" offset="240201">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.939" offset="259114">This case here is here on certiorari on question one; the petitioner relies on Rule 52(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.121" offset="319822">The petitioner was indicted on four counts, on bribery charges alleged to have been committed in violation of Title 18 U.S.C., Section 201.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.179" offset="372067">The petitioner was found not guilty on count one, which alleged that the petitioner bribed United States Revenue Agent, Roger S. Davis on October 24, 1961 and violated [Inaudible] to refrain from making an examination of books and records relating to sales and receipts of the bar and lounge at Clauson's Inn, Falmouth, Massachusetts in the years 1959 and 1960 and the first two quarters of the year 1961 from computing tax on said sales and receipts and reporting the same to the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.894" offset="526921">The tax alleged is a cabaret exercise tax that would attach if the operation was conducted with the entertainment of singing or dancing in connection with the playing of the orchestra or jukebox.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.858" offset="582823">There was evidence at the trial to support the charge in count one that the petitioner offered Agent Davis a bribe of $420 on October 21, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.807" offset="630575">On the record of the trial, there was no dispute that the petitioner gave and Agent Davis received $420 on October 21, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.378" offset="672893">The issue was, whether it was given and received as a bribe and the jury decided that is was not a bribe under the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.171" offset="708106">Counts two, three and four alleged that the petitioner bribed Agent Davis on October 24, 1961 with intent to influence him to conceal from the government the sales and receipts of any cabaret tax due thereon for the petitioner's operation of the bar and lounge at Clauson's Inn for the years 1959, 1960, 1961 and thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.993" offset="803297">The jury returned guilty verdicts in counts two, three and four.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.181" offset="820120">The uncontroverted facts established by the government's evidence are set out for record references on pages 6 to 16 of the petitioner's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.156" offset="864005">The facts show as follows: First of all, the record is darn of any activity in the petitioner's business operation at Clauson's Inn, showing that the petitioner conducted, held out or knowingly permitted the singing or dancing entertainment that would create the tax liability prior to October 16, 1961, at which time the policy was changed to offer such entertainment as shown on the books of the petitioner and on the defendant's Exhibit D in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.205" offset="1012172">Further at the trial, Government Agent Davis testified that he knows no basis for a cabaret tax liability on the operation prior to August 31, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.195" offset="1072149">The Revenue Inspection Service organized a plan to entrap the petitioner by arranging for Agent Davis to go to Clauson's Inn on October 24, 1961 and meet with the petitioner at the petitioner's private office according to their stated purpose, to relate back, the conversation of Davis and the petitioner to the meeting of October 21, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.954" offset="1183222">Agent Davis testified that his agreement with the petitioner was to return to the premises so that he could file a return if due.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.049" offset="1227525">Agent Davis came to Clauson's Inn on October 24, 1961 in concert with other agents with a Minifon on his person.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.408" offset="1269008">Invited himself into the petitioner's office and the Minifon recorded what the petitioner and Agent Davis said and did at the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.122" offset="1311848">The Minifon recording is an evidence over objection and shows at the outset of the meeting of October 24, 1961, that the plan was frustrated by a statement of the petitioner stating, “I never did thought a cabaret tax, I never thought there was a need of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="322.856" offset="1394813">This statement registered the mind of the petitioner then and there with the force of a verbal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.361" offset="1424802">Notwithstanding this statement, agent Davis proceeded to convert his operation into the making of cabaret tax claims, false and fictitious in view of the fact that he knew of no basis of cabaret tax for 1959, 1960 and 1961 prior to August 31, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.208" offset="1528247">And that these statements of fact of claims were grossly false and grotesque in relation to the petitioner's operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.039" offset="1571506">Agent Davis stated to the petitioner at this meeting on October 24, 1961, a claim of tax penalties, which was false on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.103" offset="1615809">Immediately following this claim of penalty, agent Davis made the thrust for the bribe, “Now, I don't want to get greedy or anything, but well what would you be gaining?”</text>
            <text syncTime="390.818" offset="1666696">In effect, the request for the bribe and the bribe resulted pursuant to the request.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.012" offset="1699401">As under Sherman against United States conduct of the government agents relevant and important and the conduct cannot be disclaimed by the government, with respect to the facts that I have stated here, I would ask the Court's attention for the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.220" offset="1768260">Referring to the meeting of October 21, 1961 the testimony of Agent Davis was, “I told him,” referring to the petitioner, “I asked him how much money was on the desk and he said $420.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.892" offset="1834924">About that time I picked the money up, it was about 10 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.352" offset="1852792">I put it in my pocket and left his office.”</text>
            <text syncTime="440.815" offset="1866585">When Agent Davis left Clauson's Inn with the $420 that Saturday night, he was in a predicament.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.038" offset="1891558">Obviously, he was in violation of regulations of his department in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.148" offset="1911933">Under the regulations, if there was an indication of a bribe, he was to change the subject, close the file and leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.515" offset="1941400">He had been attached to the Internal Revenue Service for two years and was in account of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.060" offset="1963656">His visit at Clauson's on October 21, 1961 was routine.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.790" offset="1986539">A policeman investigating a matter is routine would consider it as unthinkable, to take a bribe without a corroborating witness and then attempt to explain it to a superior.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.307" offset="2032619">And the facts in this case, he testified that he first talked with a fellow agent after leaving the inn on the night of October 21, 1961 and then later, with his Group Chief at the instance of a fellow agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.773" offset="2090506">At the time, Agent Davis on his own testimony had no basis for an excise tax on the petitioner's operation, for any time prior to August 31, 1961 and he did not state to the petitioner on October, 21, 1961 that he owed any amount prior to October 16, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.866" offset="2182875">His superiors even know or ought to have known these facts and also the agreement of Agent Davis with the petitioner that he was to return to the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.162" offset="2219969">So that he, the petitioner, could file the return if due, before they started up with the task force equipped with Schmidt and Minifon devices to entrap the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.565" offset="2261661">On the testimony, none of the Revenue Service Agents know of any basis that the petitioner owed any excise tax on the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.929" offset="2299068">Consequently, there is involved in this plan, an operation of the Revenue Inspection Service Agents in concert with Agent Davis and imputable to Agent Davis at least, the relief of his own situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.085" offset="2359672">In relation to the invading of the petitioner's mind by Agent Davis with lies to setup a false promise for tax liability to ensnare and provoke him into criminality, it is submitted is diabolic in aspect and sounds [Inaudible].</text>
            <text syncTime="590.073" offset="2463640">Under Sorrells and Sherman, entrapment symbolizes instigation of a crime by government officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.343" offset="2504704">Also, the defense of entrapment is properly invoked from the officers of the law. Induce a person to commit a crime, which he would not otherwise have committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.605" offset="2553814">Agent Davis from the facts of this case instigated, incited, persuaded and induced the petitioner to make the bribe in circumstances where the agent created a false framework of facts in the petitioner's mind of cabaret tax liability, impossible to have been conceived by the petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="885.396" offset="3645001">The government in its brief, I'm glad Your Honor brought that up, I think I can answer it at this time, the government in its brief imputes to the petitioner two alleged misconceptions, first in effect that the equivalent of count one was an adjudication of evidence requiring the rejecting of the government's evidence and accepting the petitioner's version.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.650" offset="3722010">On the contrary, the petitioner's position was that the government's evidence in the case as I stated it, establishes entrapment as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.641" offset="3765896">Secondly, the government imputes to the petitioner in its brief that by reason of the acquittal on count one the case must be judged as though no bribe offer had been made by the petitioner on October 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.391" offset="3824933">Again, the petitioner answers, that no such assumption has been made as an effect of acquittal on count one, but that the offer of the bribe is in effaced, because there was entrapment on the government's evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.901" offset="3887000">If in fact the crime of bribery were to be committed on October 21, 1961 under Sorrells and Sherman, it would be the duty of officials to detect and procure the evidence, but not to instigate and create a new such crime or another crime on October 24, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.965" offset="3983235">This principle was the holding in Sam Yick against the United States, 240 Federal, cited in Sorrells with approval where a Chinese attempted to bribe an officer relating to smuggling Chinese.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.146" offset="4036002">Well there apart, enticed the accused to combine with him in illegal smuggling of Chinese and then charged him with a lot of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.297" offset="4072573">This was held to constitute entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.665" offset="4086053">In the case of United States against Klosterman, 248 Federal second set out at length in the brief, the petitioner's brief, it was decided as a matter of law, there was illegal entrapment on the facts where a federal agent was charged with bribery to close an income tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.022" offset="4159509">Klosterman predicated his decision on Sorrells and the case has particular significance to the petitioner's case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.617" offset="4197857">Klosterman on the basis of Sorrells stated the issue as whether or not the criminal intent proceeded from the government agents of whether or not these agents simply afforded opportunities to one already disclosed to be alleged criminality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.782" offset="4270477">Klosterman decided that the test to be applied under the principles governing illegal entrapment is, “Was the defendant a man otherwise innocent who would not have committed the crime, but for official solicitation or was he predisposed to pursue a criminal desire, which he have already conceived.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1079.853" offset="4422823">As the Court said in Klosterman, an alleged bribe in connection with an income tax matter is not a recurring crime in a series.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.755" offset="4462425">The defendant Revenue Agent Deeney in the case actually conceived the plan to participate in a bribe to close a tax case and approached a fellow agent that they act together on it, a fact, which the Court deemed a criminal act by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.227" offset="4536299">Later agent Deeney events the intention to withdraw and as shown by the excessive persuasion, he abandoned the intent and the particular intent for the commission of the bribery was thus originated and engineered by the government officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.259" offset="4604426">The Court so held and so said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.669" offset="4614040">In the instant case there was more than excessive persuasion by the government agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.326" offset="4636714">He originated and engineered the false framework of facts as to tax liability in the petitioner's mind, which was relation to persuasion was recklessly and grossly false, grotesquely in oddment with respect to the subject matter and the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.342" offset="4724694">A brief examination of the record on pages 84 and 85 at a glance will show this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.430" offset="4757086">On the facts, it could be not found that the defendant was pursuing a criminal design, which he had already conceived with relation to the events of October 24, 1961, or a general or a special intent to commit the alleged bribe when the government agent conceived and planned it on October 24, 1961 and in terms of causality, it is inescapable that the crime would not have been committed but for official solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.386" offset="4896893">Now, if Your Honor please, I will turn to question two.</text>

            <text syncTime="1220.121" offset="4983829">My answer, Your Honor, is two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.105" offset="4991770">First of all, on the established evidence, if they did take the evidence into consideration, that the entrapment as a matter of law, so it should have been beyond that consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.942" offset="5043179">Now secondly, if the question would have to come up afresh with a severance of a trial, it might very well be objected to on the basis in the view of the acquittal as a fragmentation of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.122" offset="5103888">But our position here is that on the evidence and it's clear on the Minifon that was introduced by the government and the government's witness that on the events taking place on October 24, 1961 those facts show entrapment as a matter of law irrespective of what occurred on October 21, 1961, that is my position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.398" offset="5200959">Now if I may turn to the charge and may I ask the Court's attention to page 27 of the petitioner's brief?</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.166" offset="5240038">The quote at the bottom of the page charged, now the law with respect to entrapment is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.641" offset="5269922">“If a government agent by improper means or over-bearing persuasion or wrongful conduct induces a person of ordinary firmness to commit a crime, which he would not otherwise commit, then under those circumstances, the defendant is to be acquitted, not because he did not do something wrongful, but because he was induced to do a wrongful act, which he would not otherwise have done.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.967" offset="5359261">Now on the third paragraph, on page 28, the burden of proof with respect to entrapment is on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.200" offset="5392175">Now, it is to be noted that there was no issue as to how an ordinary person would have reacted or done in the position of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.424" offset="5429060">The issue was whether the defendant was entrapped, not whether an ordinary person would have been, and this is expressly filed and held in United States against Monroe 257 Federal predicating in on Sherman in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.745" offset="5526340">Further, the burden of proof must be allocated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.719" offset="5538252">The burden is upon the defendant to produce evidence that government agents induced him to commit the crime, and whenever this has been brought up by the defendant, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that inducement was not the cause, the creator of the crime and I cite United States and Laundry and Lefkowitz against United States as appears on page 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.011" offset="5619440">Now may I ask the Court's attention to pages 30 and 31, and I say this whole matter is clearly elucidated by Judge Learned Hand in the case of United States against Sherman 200 Federal.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.326" offset="5676701">May I ask your honor's attention particularly to page 31?</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.804" offset="5698539">Judge Learned Hand is speaking of the charge to the jury -- of the Court to the jury where the jury had returned for instructions and the judge concluded his charge as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.248" offset="5744410">“The law says you can't trick anyone into it by artifice or fraud such as giving a fabulous offer, or telling somebody that you are in excruciating pain and you must have it, or some such inducement that would put the idea into somebody's head where it never existed before.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.237" offset="5820270">Continuing in the words of Judge Learned Hand, “With those as the last words on the subject the jury retired and came back almost at once with a verdict of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.700" offset="5874186">So far it concerns the defense, that is the inducement, it was complete without "trickery" or "fraud."</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.881" offset="5898846">It includes soliciting, proposing, initiating, broaching or suggesting the commission of the offence charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.055" offset="5931551">Now on the matter -- the issue was whether the defendant was entrapped not whether an ordinary person would have been, the Court continues, “We are not sure whether the idea that must not have existed before in somebody's head, we assume this meant the accused was the idea of committing the particular offence charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.577" offset="6021726">If so, it added nothing to inducement simpliciter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.788" offset="6038549">And the Court goes on, “No view can we find that the cause was presented to the jury in such terms that they could apply the law as we understand it, and the error, which went to the very heart of the prosecution, was grave enough to be noticed, although the defense had not accepted to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.023" offset="6503424">Agent Davis testified with respect to the meeting of October 24, 1961 on inquiry by the Court calling for precise statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.549" offset="6541563">What I agree to was to return to the premises so that he the petitioner could file a return “If Do”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.201" offset="6568208">Thus the government Agent Davis' indifference to the private office of the petitioner under a precise agreement to transact clearly defined legal government business with the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.860" offset="6614810">And his presence there represented to the petitioner, this time with the Minifon on this person under instructions from his superiors, he invited himself into the petitioner's private office with the purpose of business doing crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.472" offset="6669249">At the trial, admission of the testimony of the Agent Davis on the Minifon recording was objected to, as evidence obtained by unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.938" offset="6711150">If the evidence were excluded, the case in counts two, three and four would trail for lack of proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="1941.366" offset="7868792">Third, there was the question of relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.134" offset="7879868">There was absent the relationship with a federal officer in a private office to have conducted a brief and legal tax business with United States, which by deception was converted to a plan to entrap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.648" offset="7925948">This relationship I argue comes within purview of the statement by Mr. Justice Stewart in Lanza against the State of New York, in which he said with respect to an area immunized by the constitution, the relationship was the line [Inaudible] would particularize confidentiality, must continue to receive safety and protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.239" offset="8040364">On the issue of entrapment, I think the full answer is disclosed by an analysis of the testimony in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.410" offset="8077040">I won't go through it in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.879" offset="8086862">I simply want to point out that there were only fourth times when entrapment can be claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.944" offset="8119150">There were four visits by agent to the premises, Clauson's Inn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.142" offset="8135973">The first time was on August 31st around noon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.670" offset="8150079">At that time no entrapment is claimed, no offer was made, no bribe was received.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.484" offset="8177351">Later that same evening August 31st there was a second visit, but during this visit there was by agreement in the testimony, no conversation between the agent and petitioner and we come to October the 21st in the evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.729" offset="8238268">At that time as I understand the petitioner's argument both in his brief and today, no entrapment is claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.003" offset="8271391">It is however true that the agent accepted $420 from the petitioner, but he did so according to his testimony after refusing it several times and without in anyway inducing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.138" offset="8331891">This in our minds establishes the petitioner's willingness to bribe the agent and is the beginning of the criminal design to settle his tax liability through bribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.827" offset="8390719">The same design continues three days later on October the 24th when there is second meeting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2100.791" offset="8506493">However, the testimony shows that the petitioner was in his words anxious to get a friendly and not a belligerent agent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2159.220" offset="8740237">Petitioner answers, “Well, I said to Mr. Davis, I said, I don't know how to ask you this, but I would rather have you as a friendly agent than a belligerent one,” something to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.305" offset="8788616">I said, “Would you be willing to help me to prepare and form a cabaret tax whenever it comes due and whatever is necessary to make it up, if you wish to do this and on your own time, I will pay for it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.193" offset="8840129">This is the Petitioner's own explanation of the reason to which he gave the $420.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.384" offset="8868864">But according to the Petitioner himself, this is volunteered by him before there is any question of money as the beginning to, before the subject of money even comes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.357" offset="8920795">We think it's therefore clear that the idea of transfer of money for whatever purpose originated in the Petitioner's mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="2233.648" offset="9037928">I think Your Honor's question to Petitioner's counsel resolved that point, however, the acquittal as to October 21st in view of the Judge's instructions merely shows that the jury did not believe that the money was given for the purpose of preventing the agent from examining the books, but it did not show that the money may not have been given for another purpose such as suppressing the tax liability regardless of the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.769" offset="9154435">As a matter of fact, the tax liability wouldn't have appeared in the books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.076" offset="9175646">Now, getting to October the 24th, everyone agrees, I take it that the only testimony with regard to that date which the jury can have considered is the recording itself, recording is complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.755" offset="9250356">It was authenticated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.667" offset="9262059">There has never been any question about it being a true and accurate recording of the events that took place on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.941" offset="9291107">Now as I understand, the petitioner, his only referenced even for October the 24th, his the only pinpointed reference to any claim of entrapment is after the agent goes through a long series of computations and ends up with a figure of $10,000 or $12,000 as liability and makes some remark at that point “I don't want to be greedy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.356" offset="9396746">I think it's important to point out what had already occurred on that same date according to the same recording before any such statement was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.309" offset="9436557">On page 81 of the record, the recording is reproduced in the record from pages 80 to 94, this is right at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.352" offset="9488802">The Agent walks in, the Petitioner asking to have lunch, the Agent refuses, suggests they go into the office, they do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.688" offset="9518164">The Agent then says, how long you have been in business, the Petitioner replies, two and a half years, but no facts or figures have yet been detailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.883" offset="9554944">And at this point, according to the transcripts of the recording, at page 81 towards the bottom, Lopez says, “I want you to have my confidence and I want to have your confidence too.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.400" offset="9612936">Davis says “Well, what is it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.789" offset="9618578">Lopez says again, “Listen, I want you to understand 100% confidential, I want you to place as much confidence in me too” and then this interruption and turning to page, we get a further statement by Lopez.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.803" offset="9670614">“Whatever we decide to do from hereon, I'd like you to be on my side and visit with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.138" offset="9691930">Deduct anything you think you should and I'll be happy too, because you may prevent something coming up in the office,” and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.200" offset="9728188">Clearly there, the bribe offer is already being made long before the statement complained of which appears on page 85 towards the bottom of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.322" offset="9784613">I think the record so clearly dispels any notions of entrapment as a matter of law that I need not pursue that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.081" offset="9819721">There is a claim that the instructions were erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.338" offset="9840724">One of the members of the Court has already suggested that the instruction as to burden of proof may well be cured by the general instruction on burden of proof, which appears at page 129 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.309" offset="9908642">But in any event, even conceding that there was an error in the charge, we take the position that entrapment was not an issue in the case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.903" offset="9959006">It was not even a tax issue, need not have been submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.504" offset="9977396">The judge in submitting it to the jury was merely responding to the oral argument of the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2580.186" offset="10424090">Now even this County, the agent's testimony, the recording shows that the petitioner admits the dancing had taken place long before October 16th because he makes a reference to the summer months.</text>

            <text syncTime="2804.066" offset="11319672">By arguing even to the jury less ambiguously than he did, charged to jury, I mean the closing argument of the defense counsel is not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.843" offset="11362722">However, we have filed the copy of it with the Court since the question has come up as to a possible raising of the issue there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.021" offset="11407444">And finally of course, the defendant did not accept the charge given and the errors he now complains of were only raised on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.085" offset="11455718">Now turning to the second issue in the case, the use -- well, as I understand the petitioner's argument, he objects not only to the introduction of the recording, but he objects equally to testimony of the agent with respect to the conversation that was recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.361" offset="11544848">Nevertheless, we treat the two questions somewhat separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.650" offset="11561984">As to the agent himself, clearly he was guilty of no trespass in entering the petitioner's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.518" offset="11593435">He used no force, no threats, no substitute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.723" offset="11610258">He didn't even make an affirmative misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.586" offset="11625723">He had previously identified himself as a revenue agent, he was well known to be a revenue agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.535" offset="11653517">He did, however, misrepresent his purpose, if you will, in that he didn't say, “I will reveal what you tell me” but that is the extent of any misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.371" offset="11704822">It is certainly less than the misrepresentation On Lee on the question of trespass by misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.891" offset="11734915">We of course feel this case is governed by the On Lee decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.232" offset="11756335">Now as per the instruments, it is argued that the instrument was an uninvited guest, the instrument itself was a trespasser.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.890" offset="11802937">Again, the instrument here is no more trespasser other than the instrument you know On Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.282" offset="11828537">You know On Lee, it was transmitting device, here it was a recording device.</text>
            <text syncTime="2938.276" offset="11856436">Properly speaking, the instrument is more an extension of the agent than a separate third person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.532" offset="11885484">It merely duplicates by an electrical recording what the agent himself mentally records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.173" offset="11928116">But even if there were a trespass, we could not understand the need to exclude the evidence, because there was no connection between the trespass if there was one and the evidence obtained, which was not physical evidence taken from a room, this was not eavesdropping on a private conversation that was peculiar to that room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.948" offset="12043160">The bribe offer could just as well have taken place elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.920" offset="12059042">In fact, the defendant was apparently willing to discuss the bribe at lunch in the dinning room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.382" offset="12084851">It was the petitioner's -- it was the agent's suggestion that they go into the office and his only reason for so suggesting was that he have been told, he'd get better acoustical results on his machine if he did it in the quiet of the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.083" offset="12147754">It wasn't privacy of the office, it was a quiet of the office that was helpful to his mechanical recording.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.909" offset="12182967">There is another fact which removes this case from any question of invasion of privacy in our view and that is that conversation which the machine overhears is not one between two strangers to the machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.938" offset="12271156">It's not eavesdropping on a private conversation between two people neither of whom knows that he is being overheard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.983" offset="12315355">One of the parties to the conversation from the beginning intends to divulge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.588" offset="12341687">The other party knows that he is talking to a Federal Law Enforcement Officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.839" offset="12370735">He knows that he bears the risk that there maybe a breach of this confidence that he is divulging.</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.237" offset="13076355">“The right which appellant here says would seem to be little more than the right to rely upon the agent's apparent inability to produce proof beyond his own testimony of the substance of the conversation in which he engaged.</text>
