            <text syncTime="38.090" offset="257818">Mr. Chief Justice, Your Honors, this Lord's Prayer and Bible reading case, which is before the Court today, has perhaps a unique importance for all of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.966" offset="325319">The reason is that all of us have certainly at some time, been concerned with philosophical meanings attached to our existence here, see the significance of that existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.795" offset="376623">And, all of us have no doubt, directed ourselves to resolution of questions of the goals and means and functions of mankind and all of us have thought and contemplated and no doubt prayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.127" offset="437959">Such contemplation and thought, it is in the very nature of man to perform, sapient man, wondering, inquiring man.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.799" offset="484665">And the nature of man being what it is, man has developed over the long centuries complex and subtle systems of philosophy and out of these systems, and out of the historical knowledge and out of faith, man has constructed complex and subtle systems of religious belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.811" offset="568675">And out of these systems of religious belief, man has constructed doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.310" offset="590618">At the same time, extending back through painful ages, man has concurrently developed differing and no less subtle and no less complex systems of government based at different times and different places on different principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.255" offset="662403">Perhaps, the noblest of all of these systems of government is that system embodied in the enlightened and libertarian Constitution, including the Bill of Rights of the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.909" offset="721021">In fact, the principles embodied in this document are probably so noble and so ennobling that without doubt, many of us experience some difficulty in daily, and drawing ourselves up to the perpetual measure of their standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.342" offset="798762">One of these standards, of course, set forth in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights as interpreted by this Court, is the principle that the church and the state in this country shall remain separate and apart and that in fact, there shall be a wall of separation between them which shall be maintained high and impregnable.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.166" offset="1082034">This particular case concerns a rule of the Board of School Commissioners of Baltimore City which is found at page 4 of the petitioner's brief and it's very short, I'll perhaps read it to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.132" offset="1129994">“Opening exercises,” this is a rule drawn under the administrative powers of the local School Board, and this rule has been in existence, I believe, since about 1905.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.358" offset="1226856">This rule, before the advent of this case was amended as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.223" offset="1246292">“Any child shall be excused from participating in the opening exercises or from attending the opening exercises upon the written request of his parent or guardian.”</text>
            <text syncTime="295.060" offset="1285684">If Your Honors please, I feel that the reason for the First Amendment interpretation having been at some time stated to have erected a wall between church and state is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.045" offset="1341586">It stretches back as far back as the history of governments, and particularly as far back as the history of religions themselves.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.703" offset="1784205">What we have here, of course, is a religious ceremony set up by the school, conducted by the school and, by very strong implication, having the support and the favor of the school.</text>

            <text syncTime="534.156" offset="2242079">However, the respondents' brief did call it a devotional exercise at one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.764" offset="2272486">I'm fairly certain, I believe so.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.821" offset="2304669">The conclusion that, it seems to me that the courts have come to in this country, is that, to quote Mr. Justice Rutledge in Everson as he was reiterated in Engel, “the price of religious freedom is doubled.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.510" offset="2371438">It is that the church and religion shall live both within that freedom and upon that freedom.”</text>
            <text syncTime="576.785" offset="2412607">Yet, in spite of the fact that the doctrine has become established, it would seem to me that the church and the state should be separated.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.532" offset="2467568">There has grown up this practice in the Maryland schools and it's been tolerated and blinked at for so long that the respondents have now denominated a tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.462" offset="2507274">Well, I don't think, if Your Honors please, that we can repeal the Constitution by this particular means.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.964" offset="2533292">A matter which is once unconstitutional does not become constitutional by being allowed to persist, even though it has continued almost as long as Plessy versus Ferguson can continue -- had continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.414" offset="2583030">And, this particular practice has continued without even a Plessy versus Ferguson to support it.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.161" offset="2606017">Our society develops.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.413" offset="2611033">It matures.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.153" offset="2614063">Its institutions develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.061" offset="2621691">They change.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.191" offset="2630154">The practice which one generation had not the courage to question, much less overturn, seems to me must, if we are to advance, be questioned by the next generation.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.686" offset="2672159">And that generation must even summons up the courage to overturn certain practices within the constitutional framework when the issue is put to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.796" offset="2716568">Of course, we are asked how can a religious men have such an attitude, and we are told that the answer to this is that those who urge the petition of the petitioner -- the position of the petitioners here not only are not religious but they have set themselves in opposition to religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.476" offset="2779366">And I respectfully say, if Your Honors please, that this is completely untrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.741" offset="2796398">It is unreasonable to say this as it is unreasonable to say that a person who is opposed to unreasonable searches and seizures is opposed to law enforcement, or that a person who is opposed to censorship is opposed to purity.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.200" offset="2850210">Arguments such as this, I feel, lift a continent of all the stone.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.229" offset="2870376">They are non-sect declarations.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.956" offset="2881243">The respondents, it seems to me, perhaps have the mark of being something like non-religious for they have said in their brief at page 28 that this ceremony has come to have a meaning which transcends mere religiousness, and I don't want to -- I don't wish to cast reflections on a particular language that they chose but it seems to me that infinity plus one is still infinity and I don't know that there is anything which can transcend religiousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.829" offset="3008721">The petitioners certainly do not urge that there is any such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.289" offset="3022618">The petitioners are merely here asking that an injury which they have suffered and which they say is guaranteed under the Constitution be redressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.126" offset="3069952">The injury is very real.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.756" offset="6024401">The authorities that I have been able to find in the theological field seem to be agreed that the Lord's Prayer is a Christian prayer and even within the Christian denominations, there is difference as to which version shall be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.644" offset="6095976">The Douay omits the “Thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and ever, Amen”, as I understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.698" offset="6140176">The matter is something which we run into head-on every time that we try to have a religious ceremony conducted by a government or by a government agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="1535.679" offset="6248114">This case, of course, makes everyone uncomfortable because a large majority of the country loves this prayer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1545.849" offset="6288865">Certainly, the large majority of the country loves the literature of the Bible and it's certainly one of man's outstanding works and therefore, it gives us I think a great deal of discomfort to have to face the fact that perhaps, this ceremony which most people adore is an unconstitutional ceremony because it's a religious ceremony and it is not a secular study.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.039" offset="6397534">There is no reason, and I've seen it lamented many times, it has been lamented in the brief of the respondent in the Schempp case which follows that -- in a footnote, I think it was Footnote 9, referred to in footnote -- to the respondents' brief -- to the Attorney Generals' amicus brief, that study of the Bible, study of religion and religiousness is out of the schools, that things are too neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.864" offset="6528878">Baltimore Sage who is well-known, General W. Johnson, I recall, writing a letter to the newspaper about a year ago lamenting the same fact when this issue first came to the Court that the trouble with biblical study in the school is that there are too many sects who are contesting and as a result, he lamented the fact that every time study of the Bible as literature or as history or as historic or as cultural history is tried in the schools, that these various sects object to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1641.853" offset="6672865">It seems to me that perhaps, the resolution of this matter, if this practice is unconstitutional, is for the sects to not be so selfish, self-centered on their own dogmas that they would raise these objections to the study of the Bible in school, for the use of the Bible in English class, to the study of religions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1739.059" offset="7061671">Nobody would argue that to conduct a catholic mass in the school would be unconstitutional, but they have put forth the argument that this ceremony is only somewhat religious and that it has only a shade of religiousness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1779.689" offset="7224153">Now, what surprised me as I read further in the respondents' brief was that, after arguing that this matter of religiousness can take on any shade in a spectrum and be slightly religious or extremely religious, they then go on to argue that the dissenter is right to be free from coercion does not exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="1809.576" offset="7343689">They said on pages 32 and 33 of their brief, “The dissenter cannot ask that the source of disapproval or the alleged factors of compulsion be eliminated so that he will be spared the burden of any disapproval.</text>
