            <label>Mr. F. Trowbridge Vom Baur</label>
            <text syncTime="2012.166" offset="8152064">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.607" offset="8169827">This is probably the first unauthorized practice case to be argued in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.138" offset="8195950">And in my view of the petitioner's contentions raised a number of serious legal questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.122" offset="8223848">And as a result, I have a fair amount of materials to try to get out in 30 minutes and accordingly I will endeavor to present my argument in more or less outlined form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.153" offset="8267943">Now, there are certain facts which the petitioners did not mention of which I think are material to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.612" offset="8301798">The Solicitor General states in his brief that the petitioner here had practiced in Florida for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.119" offset="8331891">This is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.597" offset="8337742">The petitioner moved to Florida in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.882" offset="8362924">And there he proceeded to rent an office on the First National Bank building of Tampa and to advertise himself on the office door as a Patent Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.210" offset="8408168">And in answer to your question, Mr. Justice Stewart, the petitioner admitted in his brief in the Supreme Court of Florida which I have here, that the term ‘patent attorney', quote, “implies that he is a member of the Florida Bar.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.632" offset="8481938">Then he proceeded to advertise himself in August, 1960 in the classified directory of the telephone book as a patent attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.269" offset="8520495">And properly thereafter, in February 1961, the Unauthorized Practice Committee of the Florida Bar got after him and sued him, sued to enjoin the unlawful practice of law by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.593" offset="8577755">Now here's what the petitioner did in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.580" offset="8589667">First, he rendered legal opinions as to infringement and as to patentability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.723" offset="8618297">Secondly, he prepared patent applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.977" offset="8631254">Third, he prepared legal documents, specifically license agreements, and he was admitted in the court below, and I'm quoting now from page 2 of the record, that the petitioner quote, “holds himself out to the public as authorized to engage in the practice of law in the patent field.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.884" offset="8702934">In short, this is a holding out case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.934" offset="8719130">Now, in the decision below, as it has already been indicated, the court below held that each of the acts in question committed by the petitioner, constituted the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.304" offset="8768554">And the Court also held that the practice of law or rather the practice of patent law was the practice of law because the petitioner argued in the court below that the practice of patent law was not the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.916" offset="8822993">Now it has also been indicated but not quite specifically enough, the petitioner here does not contest the entire decree below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.577" offset="8857684">He does not assert a right to continue to use the term ‘patent attorney' or to continue to hold himself out as a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.152" offset="8891956">Now, he does not assert the right to continue to repair legal documents and notably license agreements, and he does not assert the right to otherwise engage in the practice of law, and notably trademark practice which is also covered by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.312" offset="8948590">And here, we come close to the point of the case perhaps of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.978" offset="8967293">As I read his reply brief at page 2, he does not assert a right to give legal opinions as to infringement and patentability if unconnected with the preparation of patent opinions, but he does assert a right to give legal opinions as to infringement and patentability if connected with the preparation of patent opinions -- patent applications, I beg your pardon.</text>

            <text syncTime="2280.701" offset="9226219">Yes, sir, and here we're coming so closer to the -- to the fine point of case because the petitioner contends in this Court, his brief as replete with statement to this effect that what the court below did was to enjoin him “from practice before the Patent Office”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.050" offset="9267597">Now, I submit to this Court, that is not a fair commentary on the decision below that the court below did not enjoin the petitioner from practice before the Patent Office, and I will state my reasons why it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.503" offset="9349413">In the first place, there is no language in the opinion below which is susceptible of any such interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2973.673" offset="11998020">And in the context of facts in this case, I think it is impossible to practice before the Patent Office in Florida-D.C. and I would like to give you one big reason in my opinion why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.372" offset="12040861">Practice before the Patent Office according to the cases as I understand it means practice in the presence of the practice office, the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.231" offset="12076283">I have cited some five cases in my brief, pages 54 and 55, to the effect that practice before a government official or tribunal means in the presence of the particular government official or tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.796" offset="12142529">Those five cases in turn I may say, cites some other cases and they are not disputed by -- by adversary here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.990" offset="12171368">And further, if I may proceed to the mechanics of practice before the Patent Office which I think there are some significance on this question, we find that, I submit, the practice before the Patent Office cannot begin until, number one, a proceeding is started before the Patent Office, and number two, there is an applicant there who can be represented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.691" offset="12258095">Now, the mere preparation of a patent application does not start a proceeding in the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.373" offset="12284844">Secondly, if it's mailed at the Patent Office and physically received by the Patent Office, it is not automatically filed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.449" offset="12313161">There is a rule of the Patent Office which says, they will be carefully inspected, and if the particular application does not meet the specific requirements of the rules, the application will not be accepted, and will be sent back to the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.127" offset="12367914">And I may that if the statute of limitation runs in the meantime of course, the inventor is in trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.126" offset="12395917">Now finally, there is no applicant before the Patent Office to be represented by anybody until after an application has been physically received and legally accepted and filed by the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.029" offset="12463522">And now I come to my first point, which is if the States have the right to control and regulate the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.279" offset="12524440">This I think has been settled in this Court by Bradwell versus Illinois and in Theard versus United States in 354 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.352" offset="12560802">This Court stated that a states control over its judicial system was “autonomous” and the reason for this appears to be as stated in Theard versus United States that the Court's control over a lawyer's professional life derived from his relationship to the responsibilities of the Court, now I come to my second sub-point under this, which is the fact that the practice of law in a particular State involves federal subject matter in no way diminishes the power of the State to regulate it and here we come, if the Court please, to perhaps the only unauthorized practice of law case that has ever actually reach this Court and then cited by it with approval and that case is Kovrak versus Ginsburg in 358 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.607" offset="12757765">Now in that case, Kovrak was admitted to practice before this Court, the District of Columbia Courts and most significantly, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, a tribunal which sets in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.505" offset="12821400">Now, he was not a member of the Pennsylvania Bar, but like the petitioner here very much, he nevertheless set up an office in Philadelphia and preceded as such -- advertised himself as “attorney at law, proctor in federal taxation”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.567" offset="12885661">And at this point, the Unauthorized Practice Committee of the Philadelphia Bar Association proceeded to sue to enjoin him from unlawfully practicing law in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.599" offset="12929755">An interestingly enough in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, Kovrak's position according to the Court's statement was and I'm quoting now, “That he has a legal right to practice law anywhere in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania with regard to any legal matter in which a federal question was involved, no matter how remote.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.647" offset="13010004">This is on page 26 and 28 of respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.812" offset="13026617">And I may say this is very close to the petitioner's contention in this case, “That he has a right to practice law anywhere in Florida with regard to any legal matter in which a patent question is involved perhaps”.</text>

            <text syncTime="3281.245" offset="13228387">And the Court rejected his contention and said and I -- this is very significant if you will bear with me, I'd like to read it just one sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.741" offset="13262346">No case has been suggested to us which holds that membership in the Bar of the United States Supreme Court entitles an attorney to practice anywhere in the United States without reference to local state requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="3325.822" offset="13406647">Just as the court below pointed out that the -- that the decree below does not prevent him from practicing before the Patent Office in Washington D.C.</text>

            <text syncTime="3462.696" offset="13954173">And I submit to Your Honors that the word recognition does not deal with the subject or purport to grant anything of a nature of a federal license, rather it is a much more passive lukewarm tepid kind of word which deals only, as I read Webster's Dictionary with the subject of acceptance in the sense of being entitled to attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.287" offset="14036511">This is a far cry from an affirmative grant of a license or the language in the Federal Power Act for instance which specifically says that so on as the Commission has power to issue licenses for the construction of dams, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.704" offset="14090219">Now finally and this would be the last point I was trying to get out because I do not have any more time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.460" offset="14113207">This particular statute in dealing with the recognition, I submit, was not passed to implement Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8 of the Constitution, rather it was merely a legislative recognition of a practice which had long existed in many of the government departments as part of their inherent power as a government department under Article 2 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.013" offset="14211427">Now, the first place under that, during the Civil War and shortly thereafter, the Pension Office dealt with the subject of admission of attorneys to practice and their continued regu -- recognition under regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.394" offset="14276942">Then the Attorney General in 1880 ruled that the authority to disbar an attorney practicing before the Department of the Interior was an authority not given by statute but which seems to have been exercised heretofore by heads of departments in the protection of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.910" offset="14342980">That is independent of statute and that is this statute here because it is a companion statute, the two statutes which were passed at 1884, each virtually identical with this one, one dealing with Interior and one dealing with Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.540" offset="14401494">And finally, in Philips versus Ballinger, a case which is cited by approval by this Court in Goldsmith versus Board of Tax Appeals, the court there upheld the disbarment of a lawyer by the Secretary of Interior under the 1884 Act, which as I say is virtually identical with this one on the theory and I'm quoting the case now, “It is unnecessary to consider whether the 1884 Act constitutes anything more than a legislative sanction of the practice heretofore existing under another statute by a -- through all revised statute 161 nullified United States Code 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.459" offset="14553213">And that statute, I may say, gives the head of each department the power to promulgate rules governing the conduct of this department and this Court held in United States versus George in 228 United States that the power given by that statute was administrative only and not legislative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.759" offset="14618415">In short, my point here is, if the Court please, that this particular statute was not passed to implement Article 1, Section 8, Clause 8, but rather was a mere legislative recognition of a practice theretofore existing for many years as part of the inherent power of a government department under Article 2 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.472" offset="14697305">Now there's another feature the red light hasn't flashed yet but there is another feature here which I wish to -- which is of some importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.416" offset="14721024">And that is to take the administrative interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.128" offset="14731891">In 1938, the rules of the Patent Office were revised so as to provide categorically, and I have this in full page type on page 56 of our brief, that the registration on the Patent Office “shall not be construed as authorizing persons not members of the Bar to practice law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.917" offset="14799078">And that in 1949, the rules were given -- addressed the provision and that provision was restated in a new rule to effect that registration in the Patent Office shall only entitle the persons registered to practice before the Patent Office; in short, not somewhere else.</text>

            <text syncTime="3708.863" offset="14938781">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.188" offset="14940139">If you will look on page 56 of respondent's brief, you will see the 1938 rule which provides in categorical terms the registration before the Patent Office shall not be construed as authorizing persons not members of the Bar to practice law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.540" offset="15001579">Now there is a separate -- an additional rule which is mentioned I think in Appendix A which has said the same thing for trademark practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.107" offset="15031777">Then as I've pointed out, the 1938 rules when they were given a general revision in 1949, preceded the State, I submit the same thing by providing that registration in the Patent Office shall only entitle people to practice before the Patent Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.430" offset="15089142">Now there's one other point I should like to try to get up before the red light flashes, and that is that the patent power is a very limited power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.001" offset="15131355">This Court has held in Patterson versus Kentucky and two other cases that except for interference with an -- and fetters exclusive right to a patented invention, the Patent Clause and the patent statute passed by Congress are subject to the State's police power and there is at least one unauthorized practice case which is referred to at some length in Patterson versus Kentucky, one of the leading cases in this Court on federal state relations in the -- rather in the patent field where the -- where Jordan, this is Jordan versus Overseers of Dayton in our brief at pages 71 to 73 claimed that he had a federal right to administer a patented product without getting a license to practice medicine in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.676" offset="15326124">And the Supreme Court of Ohio and also this Court said that he have to get a license to practice medicine in Ohio before he could administer the particular invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3817.435" offset="15373145">Of that, the case at least came close to interfering with an inventor's exclusive right to an invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.645" offset="15397909">Well, our case does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3824.850" offset="15402820">Our case bears no relationship whatever to the protection of an inventor's exclusive right to an invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.851" offset="15438764">Finally, this case, if the Court please, involves the future of the Bar and my last point is that a strong Bar is itself essential to the public welfare, and in this connection, I think it is effect of no small significance that one of the first acts of dictators such as Hitler, Mussolini and Castro is to decimate the Bar and with the decimation of the Bar there disappears also that leadership and public affairs, if I may say so, and the protection of the public which a strong Bar affords.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.588" offset="15569690">And with -- if the practice of law is going to be whittled away, chip by chip and turned over to laymen, lay agencies then the public will no longer have the protection which a strong Bar affords and the public will suffer.</text>
