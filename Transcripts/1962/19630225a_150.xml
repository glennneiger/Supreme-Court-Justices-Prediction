            <label>Mr. David I. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="36.468" offset="249292">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.632" offset="261935">The basic legal issue of this case is whether the New York Stock Exchange is immune from the antitrust laws when it requires its members to boycott a non-member.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.838" offset="334764">Now what are the facts of this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="61.285" offset="348557">Petitioner, Municipal Securities Company, which I assume refer to in argument as MSC was a sole proprietorship owned by Harold J. Silver and was engaged in the municipal bond business in Dallas, Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.994" offset="439359">Municipal Securities Company Incorporated, which I shall refer to as MSC Inc., was formed by Mr. Silver in 1958 and was engaged principally in the over-the-counter corporate securities business.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.739" offset="518353">Now both MSC and MSC Inc. were licensed as securities dealers under the laws of Texas, were registered broker-dealers with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and were members in good standing of the National Association of Securities Dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.431" offset="601109">Neither MSC nor MSC Inc. was a member of the New York Stock Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.591" offset="637785">In 1956, in an order to more effectively trade back and forth with other dealers who traded in municipal bonds, MSC, that's the proprietorship, installed private telephone wires from its office to the offices of various Dallas banks and to the Municipal Bond Departments of two and later three firms who are members of the New York Stock Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.421" offset="765053">After the formation of MSC Inc. in 1958, private wires were installed from the Trading Department of the corporation to the Dallas Trading Departments of nine firms who are members of the New York Stock Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.485" offset="849272">MSC Inc. requested the Stock Exchange to approve these installations and also requested that the Exchange furnish it stock ticker or what is otherwise known as continuous quotations service.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.176" offset="912071">Temporary approval was obtained and both the private wires and stock ticker service were installed during the summer of 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.304" offset="952613">In the meantime, the Exchange was carrying on a background investigation of MSC Inc. officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.928" offset="995035">Then on February 12, 1959, without notice, either the MSC or MSC Inc., Exchange directed as member firms to discontinue all of their private wire connections to both MSC and MSC Inc.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.801" offset="1326582">But there were private wires.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.654" offset="1337971">Now, the member firms upon receipt of the directive immediately complied with it and by March 2, 1959, all of petitioners private wire connections to member firms were settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.988" offset="1423339">And at the same time, Stock Exchange withdrew the stock ticker service.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.145" offset="1443924">Now, attempts to learn the reasons for the Exchange's action proved futile since the member firms didn't know and couldn't find out the reasons for the Exchange's action, Mr. Silver personally visited the Exchange on February 16, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.981" offset="1527306">He was there told by Walter Coleman, the Assistant Director of the Exchange's department of member firms that the Exchange had a long standing policy against giving the reasons for its disapproval action.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.671" offset="1590105">On February 26, Mr. Silver wrote to Mr. G. Keith Funston, President of the Exchange, and explained that irreparable damage was being inflicted upon the financial condition and reputation of his firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.590" offset="1653739">Mr. Silver stated and I quote, “I appeal to your sense of justice and ask for the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.503" offset="1689370">(1) Temporary reinstatement of the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.239" offset="1708283">(2) That we be advised of the reasons for the action of the New York Stock Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.527" offset="1733465">And, (3) That we be given an opportunity to answer any charges and present whatever information you may require.”</text>
            <text syncTime="416.704" offset="1770141">On March 4, 1959, Mr. Funston replied as follows and again I quote, “Thank you for writing to me about your problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.481" offset="1817266">Well, I can understand your position and wanting to know specific reasons for the recent action taken by the Exchange in connection with private wiring ticker service to your organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.194" offset="1864182">I am sure you can also understand our position in defining to furnish such details.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.372" offset="1888841">Before taking any such action, the Exchange always makes a very careful and very thorough investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.727" offset="1918307">I personally reviewed the scope and results of such investigation of this case and feel that the Exchange acted properly.”</text>
            <text syncTime="461.895" offset="1950908">End quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.067" offset="1963656">On the 6th of April, 1959, petitioners commenced for this suit under the antitrust laws and prayed for injunctive relief mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.250" offset="2016423">Later, on the petitioners' motion for partial summary judgment, the Exchange for the first time revealed its reasons for terminating petitioners' wire connections.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.647" offset="2081938">The Exchange asserted that it took the action it did because, one; its investigation had turned up certain scurrilous matter with respect to the Silvers.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.614" offset="2137840">The nature of which Your Honors has been disclosed neither to the petitioners, to petitioners' counsel or even to the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.311" offset="2184652">Two, the Silvers' sold certain shares of the U.S. Hoffman Machinery Corporation in 1955, 2 months after acquiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.876" offset="2238882">Although at the time of acquisition, they stated they had no present intention of selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.084" offset="2263751">Three MSC Inc.'s application for private wire connection approval omitted from a long list of corporate connections covering a ten year period, the names of two corporations with which Mr. Silver had been connected.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.910" offset="2347029">And four, and perhaps the most important, in 1953, some six years prior to the Exchanges' action, the Defense Department had suspended the security clearance of a corporation, not one of those omitted from MSC Inc.'s application in which the Silvers were principal officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.901" offset="2470954">Now the District Court considered each of the four grounds relied on by the Exchanges' justification for its actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.738" offset="2510346">And it found and I quote, “First, the record fails to substantiate these charges against the Silvers.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.396" offset="2549008">That's on page 229.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.590" offset="2557680">Second, the conduct of the Exchange could not be justified by the denial of security clearance nor by any of the other facts and circumstances on which it relied.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.238" offset="2604283">That's at 232.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.310" offset="2612642">And third, the Exchange acted arbitrarily and unreasonably in directing that plaintiffs' wire connection will be settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.488" offset="2645347">And that's at page 233.”</text>
            <text syncTime="638.550" offset="2657573">Now these findings were in no way disturbed by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.969" offset="2687248">The District Court held that the termination of petitioners' wire connectors constituted a per se violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.551" offset="2737612">And upon the Exchanges' defense that it was immune from the antitrust laws, the District Court held as follows and I'm going to quote it because this is the position, we are asserting before this Court, and we think it's absolutely right.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.601" offset="2801768">Quote, “Providing that its members do not indulge in conduct which is illegal or inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade and exchange has neither the power nor the authority to determine with whom its members may or may not deal or to direct them to desist from dealing with non-member broker dealers engaged in transactions and over-the-counter securities and municipal bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.366" offset="2924857">If it does so, it does so at its peril and is subject to such appropriate action as may be taken under the antitrust laws.”</text>
            <text syncTime="713.748" offset="2958399">On appeal, a divided Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.568" offset="2981595">The majority held that while there would have been little doubt as to the illegality of the Exchanges' action, if it had not been insulated from liability under the antitrust laws, its actions in this case was within the general scope of its authority under the Securities Exchange Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.429" offset="3065083">And hence, the Exchange was immune from liability under the Sherman Act, Judge Waterman dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.711" offset="3110222">Now, as its claim from the face of the Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides no explicit antitrust immunity or actions taken by registered Securities Exchanges and as this Court has repeatedly held, no immunity will be implied unless of course there is a clear repugnancy between this case and the Securities Exchange Act and the antitrust laws and then only to the extent of the repugnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.613" offset="3285870">In this case, Your Honors, there is no repugnancy, clear or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.530" offset="3321501">In the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Congress empowered the Securities and Exchange Commission to discipline Exchange members.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.070" offset="3371656">And it required the Exchanges themselves to discipline members who violated ethical business standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.030" offset="3423483">With respect to nonmembers however, Congress provided that regulation be conducted by the SEC.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.351" offset="3460786">And this was to be accomplished by the broker-dealer registration provisions of the 1934 Act which in 1938 was supplemented by a program of self-regulation in the field of business ethics.</text>

            <text syncTime="997.177" offset="4092113">Power to prevent abuses by nonmembers was vested not in the Exchanges but in the SEC and later in 1938 in the SEC and National Association of Securities Dealers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1158.953" offset="4739218">And we say the District Court correctly held that so long as Exchange members themselves do not indulge in conduct which is illegal or inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade and Exchange has neither the power nor authority to tell them with whom to deal, with whom not to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.622" offset="4829811">Now, it's important to keep in mind at this point in the argument that the Exchanges' rule against non-approved wire connections as applied in this case had the effect of excluding the petitioners from a substantial part of the over-the-counters securities market.</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.275" offset="5392488">In fact, it was specifically restricted to private wired connections which were used for trading or otherwise dealing and then I quote again, ”Securities not listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.889" offset="6646888">Now, let's take a look at this supersessional repugnancy problem for just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.218" offset="6684296">Section 6 (c) of the 1934 Act which permits the Exchange to adapt and enforce any rule not inconsistent with the Act has got to be read together with Section 19 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.686" offset="6762141">Well, that Section authorizes the SEC to order or supplement an Exchanges' rules with respect to such matters as the reporting of transactions on the Exchange and upon tickers maintained by or with the consent of the Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.428" offset="6845106">And we think its plain, the 19 (b) does not include private wires between members and nonmembers which are used to communicate with respect to transactions and over-the-counter markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.591" offset="6897768">Or a private wire connection is to the over-the-counter market, precisely what the ticker is to the New York Stock Exchange or any other Exchange market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.141" offset="6951894">Furthermore we say, there's nothing either in the 1934 Act or its legislative history that reveals that the Securities and Exchange Commission was given power to decide antitrust issues as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.978" offset="7015320">Where -- while we agree that antitrust considerations are relevant to the performance of the Commission's functions on the 19 (b), there is no pervasive regulatory scheme including the antitrust laws that's been entrusted to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.495" offset="7101315">Because admittedly, unless everybody agrees with, including the majority below, the Securities and Exchange Commission lacks power to grant relief against the wire connection rule as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.422" offset="7169024">We've got no standing to complain before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.708" offset="7186160">And so as the District Court pointed out and I quote, “If the theory of the Exchange were correct, plaintiffs would not only have no remedy before the Commission but it would also find themselves barred from remedy in the courts on the mere say so of a private association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.721" offset="7270275">This is in mark contrast to what occurs in a recognized closed regulatory system.”</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1914.512" offset="7761377">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.118" offset="7775796">The Government has filed a brief in this case and requested time to take part in the oral argument because it involves the interplay between two major regulatory statutes, the Securities Exchange Act and the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.857" offset="7874748">I think it would be helpful in the beginning to try to put the case in a nutshell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.167" offset="7904005">The Stock Exchange has a long standing published rule which forbids its members to maintain direct wire connections without the approval of the Exchange and to terminate any wire connection when requested by the Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.149" offset="7975999">In this case, it invoked that published rule against a non-member, apparently in the honest belief that the nonmember, the petitioner, lacked integrity and reliability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.859" offset="8038797">And that such action was therefore appropriate to carry out the Exchanges' obligation and its members' obligation under the Securities Exchange Act to require its members to adhere to just and equitable principles of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.331" offset="8100655">The Exchanges' investigation into the particular facts with respect to the petitioner was so inadequate and the conclusions that it drew from the evidence that it did gather were so unreasonable, that the District Court had stated that the Exchange had acted arbitrarily and unreasonably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.055" offset="8191561">The Court of Appeals did not disagree with that but held nevertheless that the Exchange was not liable under the Sherman Act even for arbitrary and unreasonable action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.075" offset="8247672">But the Government's concern is with the legal issue and we are not concerned as the parties are with respect to the particular facts, whether the District Court's characterization is a finding that remains binding or whether the case should go back to be retried under a correct legal theory is not really any of our concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.831" offset="8350699">We are concerned primarily here with the correct rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.820" offset="8370657">We think that both Courts were wrong in their analysis of the basic legal issues and that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and the case sent back for the reasons that I'm about to state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.306" offset="8440560">Our analysis of the critical issues, I think, I can state most clearly, if I may begin by stating a few propositions that apparently are not in dispute because they really lay the necessary groundwork for getting to the more difficult questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.018" offset="8511404">And I'll state them rather boldly so as to get out as quickly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.754" offset="8534392">First, the Stock Exchanges' conduct was such as to render it liable to the plaintiff under the Sherman Act, unless the Securities Act gives it some kind of a privilege or immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.088" offset="8591757">That follows I think, from the Fashion Originator's Guild case and I do not understand it to be disputed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.364" offset="8624880">Second, the Securities Exchange Act does not give a registered stock exchange, its members or related nonmember firms, a general exemption from the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.706" offset="8678170">There's nothing in the Securities Exchange Act which makes the Sherman Act inapplicable to the securities market, it's either in New York or elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.600" offset="8721742">There's nothing that authorizes the Securities and Exchange Commission to give blanket immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.846" offset="8742745">And of course, it is settled most reasonably by California against the Federal Power Commission that the mere enactment of a regulatory law does not render the Sherman Act inapplicable to the regulated industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.213" offset="8800214">And I think in this Court there's really no question about that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.121" offset="8827904">Third, the Securities and Exchange Act does place, we say, upon registered Securities and Exchange, a duty of industrial self-regulation, the performance of which is affected with a high public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.994" offset="8895300">Now while there is some dispute about the scope of the duty here, I think that everyone agrees that Section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act does put some duty upon the New York Stock Exchange and the other Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.868" offset="8958830">The theory of the legislation was that certain minimum statutory rule should be laid down that the exchanges which were claiming to be public institutions should then act as if they were public institutions and exert their special position for the benefit of the public carrying the initial responsibility for allow -- raising above strict rules of law, the ethical and professional level of those carrying on the Securities' transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.478" offset="9085262">I dwell on this point and despite the fact that it is not disputed to emphasize the great importance that the Government especially, the Securities and Exchange Commission attaches to the Exchanges' initial responsibility for the duty of protecting a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.508" offset="9157360">No adequate substitute is really available for the Commission to take over all the regulatory and quasi-regulatory functions of the Stock Exchange because it would require or uncertainly an impracticable, and probably undesirable increase of personnel and revision of its entire method of operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2298.088" offset="9295705">I might say that in this Court, I think it is proper to state that the brief that is filed and cited by myself and my assistant, Mr. Friedman, does represent a composite view on the ground that it was up to the Government to formulate a position and as often happens with the Government probably one of the number of agencies might have stated the propositions somewhat differently, they might have answered some of the propositions that we left open here is not involved, but I do think it's fair to say that it was a very great consensus of opinion, and that this is a composite brief for the entire Government although some of the individual people, perhaps including myself might have had it a little differently if they stood alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="2353.378" offset="9516910">I think that the Commission as I understand it, thinks that its failure to set aside a filed rule of a registered Security and Exchange under Section 19 or under Section 6 gives that rule a special status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.763" offset="9614399">The Commission does not say, if my memory is correct, that it has in this case approved what the Exchange did on these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.887" offset="9654941">In other words, I'm going to argue as I progress, that there is a marked difference between the case where the challenge is to some particular rule and it is said that the rule was improper where perhaps the exchanges in action is decisive, and the Court may not go behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.423" offset="9749086">And the case where the essential advice is in the way the Exchange apply their rule to the particular facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2641.948" offset="10671208">The words of the statute plainly just speak, no such limitation or distinction between listed and unlisted security in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.143" offset="10715930">Section 6 (b) requires an Exchange to have rules for disciplining a member for conduct to our proceeding inconsistent with the just or equitable principles of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.541" offset="10761488">There's no line between where you must be just and equitable in conducting trade and where you may cheat in conducting trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.677" offset="10794088">And under Section 6 (b), the Exchanges' rules must be adequate to protect the investee, not just investors in listed securities but investors of all counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.327" offset="10840691">Surely, we submit that these two sections of the statute relating to the rules cover investors in unlisted security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.671" offset="10878098">A stock exchange member who cheats his customers when he's dealing in unlisted securities and they do deal with unlisted security but is scrupulously honest when it comes to dealing with listed securities surely cannot be said to be engaging in misconduct consistent with the just and equitable principles of trades.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.825" offset="10974647">The petitioners' argument in this Court is a little different as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.843" offset="10998784">He says that while the Exchange has a responsibility for the character and conduct of its own members, it has no responsibility for the conduct or character of nonmembers dealing in over-the-counter markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.788" offset="11058552">Well, I'm not disposed to quarrel with that proposition as a generalization, I simply submit that it doesn't answer the question and doesn't resolve the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.300" offset="11116544">But we think that the maintenance of a closed and continuous business relationship builds about direct wire connection is part of the members' conduct and that when the Exchange threatens to discipline members for maintaining wire connections with a dishonest or unreliable dealer, it is in the words of the statute disciplining a member for conduct, his conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trades.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.787" offset="11246529">I suggest first that this is plainly true as a matter of analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.634" offset="11265860">The relationships a man voluntarily maintains are part of his conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.438" offset="11301073">And if he maintains relationships that bring the dishonest or unreliable into closer touch with the financial community where they can rig the market or better prey upon their victims then he is acting in a manner inconsistent with the just and equitable principles of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.674" offset="11394069">Petitioner argued precipitously and at length in his affidavits and papers of the court below that the cutting off of these direct wired connections seriously injured his business because they're so important to one dealing in over-the-counter securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.066" offset="11467630">Well, I submit that every argument that can be made to demonstrate their importance goes to demonstrate the responsibility of the members that extend those connections and bring the unreliable and dishonest further into the financial community where they have better opportunities to engage in misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.591" offset="11573687">Common sense I think, it was suggested during the argument of Mr. Shapiro confirms that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.963" offset="11603257">Surely it can't be argued seriously that the Exchange has no legitimate concern with whether its members maintain direct wired connections with swindlers, professional gamblers, bucket shops or others who lack integrity or reliability but only does this increase the unreliable opportunity to do wrong but of course some of the disrepute and moral responsibility and public criticism will rub off on those who maintain such relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.337" offset="11752678">Finally, I think that the statute itself at least to a degree in one specific application embraces the principle that a member should refrain from affecting transactions having relationships with unfit person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.578" offset="11821641">Section 19 (a) provides that the Commission may expel a member from the Exchange if the member has affected a transaction or any other person who he has reason to believe is violating any provision of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.977" offset="11903248">In other words, there is a specific application of where the statute says that the member is responsible for the person he brings into the community and enables to engage in an improper or unlawful transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.905" offset="11970957">The so-called Maloney Amendment, 15 -- Section 15 (a), as the statute now stands, seems to us to contain nothing to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.580" offset="12017664">The Amendment put the primary responsibility for over-the-counter brokers and dealers upon the National Association of Securities Dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.325" offset="12060714">And there's no doubt that that association exercises with respect to nonmember broker-dealers, the kind of initial responsibility and general requirement of oversight that the registered exchanges exercised with respect to their method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.678" offset="12138036">But the worst that can be said is that under the theory of the court below and our theory, there exists some chance of duplication in the degree of protection accorded to investments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.245" offset="12196342">I submit not only is that inherently desirable, certainly not undesirable but it's not sufficient to show that when Congress enacted the Maloney Amendment, it intended to take away from the registered exchanges, the powers that they previously had under Section 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.366" offset="12284844">I turn now to the extent of privilege, an issue on which the Government is more nearly aligned with the petitioners, the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.051" offset="12339597">That it is with the respondent exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.995" offset="12355375">And again I start with what seems to me to be an essentially undisputed proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.402" offset="12380975">To wit that the Exchange's duty of self-regulation carries an implied privilege or immunity from liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.337" offset="12416711">At least where its action is in truth necessary to promote observance of just and equitable principles of trade, and does not unreasonably restrain competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.705" offset="12470209">I don't think that there's any difference of opinion about this, either among the two courts below or among the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.193" offset="12504168">If you go with me on the first main point that I've argued and say that there is a duty to cut off wire connections from a bucket shop or a non-swindler or someone of that kind, surely if there is the duty that the law won't turn around how would the Exchange liable under the Fashion Originator's Guild for carrying out the duty.</text>

            <text syncTime="3217.274" offset="12972492">And I want here to suggest one very important distinction which comes back to a point that I was discussing earlier with Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.322" offset="13020662">We think the two kinds of cases, as well as another distinction between the kinds of mistakes but now I'm talking about the kinds of reason the -- kinds of challenge to the Exchanges' action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.261" offset="13076459">What the challenge may be to the Exchanges' rule, let me give two illustrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.302" offset="13104567">Suppose that the Exchange were to adopt a rule that no direct wire service may be extended to any graduate, to very recognized to it, anyone who has graduated from a recognized law school or anyone who has been admitted to the Bar of the Supreme Court of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.580" offset="13181680">Such a rule, I take it, would have no tendency to promote just and equitable principles of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.391" offset="13212923">Take another possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.331" offset="13224730">Suppose that the Exchange adopted a rule that no member shall extend wire service to any broker-dealer who deals in listed securities of the big board, over-the-counter, such a rule it can be argued would tend to promote just and equitable principles of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.494" offset="13317308">It can also be answered that such a rule is an unreasonable restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.170" offset="13344057">In such a case, it would seem to us, this doesn't have to be decided but it would seem to us that someone must make the determination other than the Exchange itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.066" offset="13391600">And the question becomes whether that determination is made in binding fashion by the Securities and Exchange Commission when it registers the Exchange, it takes no action to require a change in its rules, or perhaps it is open for litigation in any case in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.294" offset="13476551">We've discussed the pros and cons because this is the first case involving this kind of problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.092" offset="13499747">It is an issue on which the Government has taken no position, because we don't think the question is presented here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3486.858" offset="14050826">They can't make that the Commission, by its silence, simply by its failure to change the rule, intended to give the Exchange a license to cut off wire connection for any reason, however arbitrary, whimsical, or malicious.</text>

            <text syncTime="3815.193" offset="15364159">Now, to answer your questions a little more precisely because there is a point here, Judge Hayes in the court below apparently said, “We read the Securities Exchange Act as giving an absolute immunity from all liability at least under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.882" offset="15450885">And that it seems to me if it's an immunity from liability under the Sherman Act, got to be equally by a parity of reasoning, and immunity from liability for conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3848.541" offset="15497488">Then he was obviously troubled by that conclusion, so he said, “Well, now we've got to create a new statutory cause of action.”</text>
