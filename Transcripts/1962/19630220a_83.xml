            <text syncTime="30.627" offset="225886">Mr. Loevinger?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee Loevinger</label>
            <text syncTime="32.313" offset="232573">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.412" offset="245008">This is an antitrust case that comes up on direct appeal from a judgment of the District Court in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.620" offset="269876">The suit seeks to enjoin the merger of the Philadelphia National Bank referred to in the briefs in sometimes as PNB and the Girard Bank on the grounds that the merger violates the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.206" offset="316165">The District Court found that the Sherman Act applied to the transaction, but that it was not violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.606" offset="337795">The application of the Sherman Act is not an issue on this appeal, but its violation is.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.731" offset="358275">The controlling facts are largely statistical and they're not disputed, although, there is substantial disagreement as to their interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.565" offset="389622">The crucial questions raised by this case are (a) Does an area in which firms conduct all of their business compete with each other and encounter the preponderant part of their competition constitute a relevant market for a merger case and (b) Does the combination by a merger of firms controlling more than one-third of a large market constitute unreasonable lessening of competition or restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.221" offset="496306">The government contends that both questions must be answered yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.281" offset="512502">The issues arise in this fashion; Philadelphia National and Girard Bank are located across the street from each other at Broad and Chestnut Streets in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.006" offset="547401">Philadelphia National has 27 branches and Girard has 38 branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.004" offset="567359">All of these are in Philadelphia or the three adjoining counties of Montgomery, Delaware and Bucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.991" offset="591287">By law, the Philadelphia Banks are permitted to have branches or conduct banking business only in these four counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.013" offset="623470">These four counties are referred to in the record and here as the Philadelphia metropolitan area or the Philadelphia area.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.810" offset="650637">Philadelphia National has over $1 billion in assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.834" offset="666728">Girard has about three quarters of a million dollars in assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.729" offset="682297">The merged bank would have one and three quarter billion dollars in assets or 37% of all banking assets in the Philadelphia area.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.841" offset="726706">The merged bank would be 50% bigger than the second biggest bank, three times as large as the third bank and would have more assets than all of the other 37 banks in the Philadelphia area put together.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.854" offset="782817">The reasons given for the merger are that it would give the merged bank a larger lending limit and thus bestow prestige upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.009" offset="815417">Mr. Potts, the President of the Philadelphia National Bank testified then in his judgment, the most important benefit of the merger to the two banks would be the prestige factor, which would include a larger lending limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.607" offset="861811">Now, this lending limit is the maximum above that a bank can loan to any single borrower, and amounts go above 10% of the capital and surplus of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.160" offset="900054">Yes sir.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="199.268" offset="900472">The Judge outside of prestige, wouldn't it also enable the merged bank to compete with New York banks and other banks of getting business?</text>

          <turn speaker="lee_loevinger" startTime="206.914" stopTime="245.032">
            <label>Mr. Lee Loevinger</label>
            <text syncTime="206.914" offset="930983">Yes sir, it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.515" offset="937462">This is their contention that it would enable the merged bank to compete with the banks in New York or loans exceeding the lending limit of the two banks, which are $6 million for Girard and $8 million for Philadelphia National.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.935" offset="995140">In other words, it would enable them to compete in the market or submarket for multimillion dollar loans, which as I shall show the Court, constitutes approximately one one-hundredth of 1% of the entire banking market in which these companies are engaged or what I would submit to the Court is this most microscopic submarket that has ever been presented to this Court in an antitrust case.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.694" offset="1098167">There are five other banks in -- well, there are no banks in Philadelphia, Your Honor, that are eligible to make loans of $15 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.483" offset="1137351">There are five other banks in Philadelphia that are eligible to make loans over $1 million and therefore in the plus million or multimillion dollar submarket.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.332" offset="1172668">The precise number in the United States is not specified in the record and there certainly are some in New York, but the alleged reason for the merger was to enable these banks to compete in this multimillion dollar submarket with the New York banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.126" offset="1231914">This was the precise finding and it was this view that led the District Court to the conclusion that Philadelphia is not a relevant market in which to test the competitive effects of the merger, because the banks had this competition for multimillion dollar loans with the New York banks.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.209" offset="1480182">$5 million is well within the lending limit of both banks now, so that the -- what they are talking about is the ability to engage in a wholly speculative sub- market, because there isn't even any showing in this record that they would get a single customer who would take from them a loan in excess of $8 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.435" offset="1557086">There is a showing that there are a total of nine loans in excess of $5 million, out of a total of over a 120,000 loans that these companies have in the Philadelphia area.</text>

            <text syncTime="781.143" offset="3227982">Now the points that I shall seek to make are first that the most relevant market for this case clearly is the Philadelphia area for a number of reasons, because the banks involved do all of their business there and indeed are authorized by law to do business only within the Philadelphia area.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.370" offset="3296841">The banks complain that the demarkations of political sub-units are arbitrary and indeed they are, in a sense, as all market limits are arbitrary, however in this case they are less arbitrary than usual because the limits of these political subdivisions are the legal limits of the authority of the banks here to do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.591" offset="3377716">In the second place, the customers in this area require local banks for their banking service as the appellees themselves have shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.773" offset="3414497">In the third place, over 95% of all the customers of both banks involved here are residents of this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.344" offset="3440724">In the fourth place, outside competition exists for only fraction of 1% of the customers in this area, as I shall demonstrate and finally because the banks involved here actually compete with each other in this area in every phase of banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.541" offset="3505507">My second point is that the merger will give the resulting bank control of more than one-third of all the banking business done in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.713" offset="3538213">My third point is that the combination by merger of large and viable firms controlling more than one-third of a market as vast as this, lessens competition and restraints trade in violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.918" offset="3591084">A holding here that acquisition of such a market share is legal would sanction the reduction by merger of the number of competitors in this or any similar market to no more than three.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.289" offset="3632567">This result, I submit, is completely inconsistent with the competitive market structure and with the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.967" offset="3655241">Now, let me address myself to the issue of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.690" offset="3666108">The discussion of the market in terms of the relevant markets suggest that there is or maybe a single unique discrete area that can be identified as the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.669" offset="3706023">This of course is erroneous and misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.273" offset="3716472">The market is simply a conceptual tool for the analysis of complex economic phenomenon.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.164" offset="3739982">Markets overlap, and any single enterprise competes in a number of different markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.727" offset="3762239">A market is always surrounded by a peripheral area in which trade crosses its arbitrary boundaries and the outer limits of all markets are vague and fuzzy.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.530" offset="3797452">This was recognized by this Court in the Times Picayune case in which I believe Mr. Justice Clark said, “The "market," as most concepts in law or economics, cannot be measured by metes and bounds nor does the substance of Sherman Act violations typically depend on so flexible a guide.”</text>
            <text syncTime="941.741" offset="3870386">Now, the market that is to be applied in antitrust cases has been laid down by this Court in Standard Stations and the Tampa Electric Case in which it is said that since preservation of competition is the object under the Antitrust Laws, the area of effective competition between the parties is the relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.261" offset="3944364">This concept has been applied in numerous cases such as Paramount where you held first run theaters in a single city to be a relevant market or International Boxing, in which championship boxing matches as distinguished from all other boxing matches were held to be a relevant market and in which the Court said that definition of the part of trade or commerce encompassed by the Sherman Act involves distinctions in degree as well as in kind, which is illustrated in the application of the Sherman Act to trade or commerce in a localized geographical area.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.615" offset="4073827">Now the Court here found that commercial banking viewed collectively with the relevant line of commerce of product market and this is not contested and it is not an issue on the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.900" offset="4110921">The banks insist that the mode of competition among commercial banks is unique and they argue that it consists primarily of convenience and quality rather than a price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.484" offset="4149269">Actually, there is substance to this argument, that they don't carry a fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.410" offset="4165047">That the point is that banks sell only service, of course banks deal in money as all businesses deal in money, but this isn't the commodity that they are selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.159" offset="4204022">What they are selling is service and all of the service that these banks render, they render within the Philadelphia area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.146" offset="4235995">All of their banking offices are there, all of their deposits are received there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.069" offset="4251669">All of their books of accounts are received there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.365" offset="4260864">All their loans are disbursed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.114" offset="4267865">All their officers and employees are employed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.576" offset="4281657">Now, what the controversy in this case arises out of is the fact that although all their business is done in Philadelphia, some of it is done with nonresident individuals or corporations and this is the source of the mass of statistics that you'll find in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.839" offset="4338709">However, there are two points to note in connection with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.416" offset="4349053">In the first place, the nonresidents constitute a very small minority of the customers of both banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.488" offset="4377370">This again is sometimes obscured by the presentation of these statistics in dollar figures rather than in terms of the number of customers, but the nonresidents is minute percentage, really, of the total number of customers involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.199" offset="4436198">In the second place, the nonresidents no less than the residents who do business in Philadelphia require banking service in Philadelphia.</text>

            <text syncTime="1201.226" offset="4908283">Assuming that there are large amounts involved by a few customers who are able to go to New York and the testimony of the President of the Girard Bank and of other witnesses was that a customer who desired to borrow $1 million or more could go to another city, but that the smaller customers were confined to their local area and there is no conflict about this testimony, assuming that there are large amounts, even assuming that there was substantially more customers than the record shows, this still does not make Philadelphia either not a market or not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.708" offset="5038164">The important thing is that Philadelphia is a relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.840" offset="5050702">Of course there are other markets that these banks may compete in, and of course there are some large amounts involved in some of these other things, although compared to the total they are not large, but the -- I'm sorry in our brief at page 34, using the appellees' figures we show the distribution by amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.688" offset="5130115">For example the demand deposits of individuals by amount 89% of the demand deposits of individuals are from residents of the Philadelphia area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1322.304" offset="5392593">Therefore of commercial -- of the sub-market of commercial and industrial loans, there is just 1% that lies or less than 1% that lies in this sub-market of multi-million dollar loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.118" offset="5443793">But when you add to these 7,000 commercial and industrial loans the 115,000 or 120,000 loans to all the residents of the Philadelphia, the Philadelphia area and these are the residents of the Philadelphia area according to defendants' own exhibits, 120,000 loans, the 70 loans, the 70 business loans in the multi-million dollar markets shrink to one-one hundredth of 1% by number of customers of the people served by these two banks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.607" offset="6649814">Incidentally, in the Columbia Steel case Consolidated did do business in the national market, but this Court noted that its business in the national market was one-half of 1% and dismissed this as being of no significance, that is far greater than the percentage participation in the national market of the Girard and Philadelphia National Banks here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.654" offset="6725987">On the other hand, there is no dispute that the overwhelming proportion of the business of the two concerns involved here is in fact done in the Philadelphia area.</text>

            <text syncTime="1949.431" offset="7901080">This is a distinction that permeates the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.307" offset="7920619">Now, I could nip it in any event it is immaterial where most of these people, where these loans came from and they certainly in the absence of some showing that there is a necessity for them to do business outside because what they are doing is selling, banking service inside the Philadelphia area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.430" offset="7997106">They themselves stress the fact that they're selling service and we agree that they're selling service, they are not selling money; they're selling banking service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.703" offset="8022183">They're like banking service stations that have 65 branches within this four-county area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.400" offset="8044962">When a motorist comes to a service station for service he may have a New Jersey or New York or a Honolulu license plate but he want service at the place of that service station Philadelphia or Washington or wherever it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.091" offset="8091773">When people come to Philadelphia for banking service, the unique and the distinctive and the valuable thing that they are the getting there is not a different kind of money it's a different location.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.778" offset="8130435">They want banking service in the Philadelphia area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.076" offset="8143705">Insofar as there is a multi-million dollar banking loan market, the appellees now are fully qualified and do participate in it and there are extensive exhibits in the record showing their participation in the so called participation loans, loans ranging all the way from $5000 to a $160 million in which they have incidentally participations ranging from under $5000 to over $5 million, but in none of these multi-million dollar loans in which they participate is there is the extent of their participation in excess of $5 million or even close to their lending limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.331" offset="8300648">Now the -- I think that it is therefore fair to say that the Philadelphia area that's been limited is a market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.068" offset="8363656">Of course there are other markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.389" offset="8368880">We don't deny that there are national markets and that there are perhaps even international markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.376" offset="8384867">All we say is that simply because there are other markets and simply because these banks may have some participation whether it is small as I say it is or slightly larger is immaterial, the degree of that participation is essentially material, that where they have an important participation in an area like Philadelphia as large as it is with as many customers, with as many billions of dollars involved, this is a relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.784" offset="8482461">Within this relevant market you can measure their market share by indisputable figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.052" offset="8503568">They have 37% of the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.585" offset="8517674">They have 36% of all the deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.721" offset="8538258">They have 39 -- they will have if they are merged to have 49% of all the deposits of other banks held by Philadelphia Banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.778" offset="8578487">They will have 34% of all the loans of Philadelphia Banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.804" offset="8602624">They will have 65 offices or nearly one-forth of all the banking offices in the Philadelphia area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.923" offset="8639091">This market share then represents the proportion of the banking business done in Philadelphia and controlled by these two banks which is all the banking service that is available to 99 or 99 and nine-tenths percent of the residents of Philadelphia who are not in the multi-million dollar loan category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.121" offset="8735848">99 and nine-tenths of a percent of those people who seek loans from banks in Philadelphia, seek loans of less than a million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.551" offset="8769599">As to these people, they are relinquished to the Philadelphia banking assets and if the merger is permitted, these banks will control more than one-third of these banking assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.846" offset="8822784">Now, the banks contend of market shares have a different significance in banking than they do in other businesses, because as they say banks do not own the funds they lend, they owe them and the bank cannot prevent its depositors from withdrawing demand deposits at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.004" offset="8883388">In fact, however, it seems to me to be clear that market shares are more firmly established in banking than they are in most lines of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.981" offset="8915257">There is a continuing relationship between banks and their customers that does not exist in other businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.850" offset="8938768">Customers for shoes or gasoline or milk can readily change the seller without notifying the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.853" offset="8962800">A bank depositor or a bank borrower can't payoff his loan or withdraw his deposits without notifying the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.742" offset="8990386">It requires significant effort for him to go out and get a substitute bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.543" offset="9005537">Further banks are used as financial reference sources to control business opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.455" offset="9025181">The need for geographical convenience is been stressed by the bank themselves, in numerous applications for branches which are in evidence and as well in their own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.672" offset="9066036">A business or a professional man cannot afford to incur the ill-will of an important banker.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.151" offset="9087979">Consequently bank customers are very slow and low change which was confirmed again by the testimony of Mr. Potts, President of Philadelphia National, who said that if there is one fact “that banks know about it, is that of a nurture and the depositors are very low to change their accounts except for good cause.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.767" offset="9170422">Therefore, this brings you to the controlling question of whether the combination by merger of banks controlling one-third of a market of this size is a restraint, a prey.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.116" offset="9219845">Now, it is perfectly clear that all of the competition between the bank themselves would be wholly extinguished, this was found by the Court and there is no denying it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.974" offset="9255267">The Court however says, that the -- because this will reduce the number of banks in the Philadelphia area by only one, that it will not have the affect of substantially restraining competition or affecting competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2311.206" offset="9348159">I'm arguing -- Section 7 is argued in the brief and we are relying on it, but I simply don't have time to cover both sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.199" offset="9376162">I'm relying on Section 1, because I think that the restraint is so perfect, is so clear, that Section 1 fairly invalidates this merger and the Court need to proceed no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.685" offset="9414092">Our point on Section 7 follows a fortiori.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.585" offset="9429661">Now, the decision in the present case was issued in January of 1962 which was some months before the decision of this Court in Brown Shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.200" offset="9472188">Consequently the Court below relied on the decision of the Second Circuit in the American Crystal Sugar case and used the so called qualitative substantiality test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.849" offset="9514820">However, I submit that the Court -- in the first place this Court has, I think somewhat repudiated that test but even if it had not, that had the Court below read the district court's opinion in American Crystal Sugar, which was affirmed and expressly endorsed by the Court of Appeals, it would have found that the rule of the American Crystal Sugar case expressly disavows the basis upon which the present case rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.708" offset="9602173">In American Crystal Sugar, there were two small companies, neither one of which, there weren't small, but the two substantial companies, but neither one of which were or were to be come by merger the leaders in the industry who together proposed to combine 13% of the market and they said that by combining 13 X 13% of the market they could better compete with the industry leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.287" offset="9688482">The district court alone said this is not what competition means for large companies to compete in order better to compete with giant companies and it held the merger was forbidden and that is the very heart of the case that the appellees made here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2416.163" offset="9767999">-- has I think best been met by the words of the Judge Weinfeld in the Bethlehem Steel case, which I submit deserved the specific approbation of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.183" offset="9808123">Judge Weinfeld said, “Congress and its efforts to preserve the free enterprise system and the benefits to flow to the nation and to the consumer, did not, in enacting the antitrust laws, intend to give free play to the balancing power of gigantic enterprises and leaves the less powerful purchaser helpless, but Congress thought to preserve as a social and economic order not dependent on the power of a few to take care of themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.410" offset="9913031">And this, as of matter of fact, is very close to the words of Chief Justice Warren dissenting in the DuPont case, although I think that the Court did not disagree with him on this point where he said a few sellers tend to act like one, in industry which does not have a competitive structure, will not have competitive behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.597" offset="9985755">The public should not to be left to rely upon the dispensations of many in order to obtain the benefits which normally accompany competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.338" offset="10016684">Such beneficence is of uncertain tenure only actual competition can assure long run enjoyment of the goals, of a free economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.407" offset="10057017">I think that we can best test the positions of the government and of the banks in this case by examining the practical consequences of projecting these positions beyond the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.351" offset="10100799">The government position would not impede the growth of large banks by expansion to meet market demands and it would permit the merger of any but the largest banks holding dominant positions in their local markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.416" offset="10153044">The government position would ensure the preservation of a substantial number of large, vigorous, and competitive banks in markets of size of Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.189" offset="10192123">The bank position, on the other hands they argued, would clearly and certainly permit the reduction of banks in any market to no more than three in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.062" offset="10231620">The bank position would carry to it's logical conclusion, which says that the local market is irrelevant and we can look at the national market would permit the merger of even these three in any markets smaller than New York in order to permit the banks to compete with the larger New York banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.306" offset="10300583">Thus, the logical result of the bank position would be that we would end by having a single market in every market smaller than New York and probably have only three alternatives or competitors left in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.491" offset="10353351">I think that there cannot possibly be any position, any choice between these alternatives nor any doubt as to which one Congress intended this Court to make as between the two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.871" offset="10410820">I would like to save the reminder time for rebuttal if it pleases the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2667.589" offset="10773713">This essentially is a dispute between two branches of the government, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice and the Comptroller.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.117" offset="10811852">The Comptroller decided this merger question, on the basis of the public interest as he was authorized to do under the Bank Merger Act of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.037" offset="10859499">As he was required to do, he asked for the advice or the suggestions of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC in respect only of their opinion on the effect of this merger on competition, probably without regard to whether the public interest was involved, that wasn't their function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.281" offset="10956466">The Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve and to some extent the FDIC reported that in their opinions the effect of the merger on competition would be deleterious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.533" offset="11017488">The only evidence that we have in the case on that subject is the evidence presented by the Department of Justice which the court below found to be totally inadequate to sustain its opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2748.659" offset="11098049">No witnesses were called to explain those statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.969" offset="11111215">No witnesses were called to give the basis for the opinions expressed, and therefore as the court below pointed out, there was no more validity suggested as to those then there was as to the opinion expressed by the Attorney General, which he found to be completely unfounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.059" offset="11183626">But this case involves a charge of a violation of the Sherman act under the Clayton Act in respect of two banks in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.198" offset="11216123">It has nothing whatever to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.060" offset="11223646">With the mergers which may or may not take place will be contemplated in New York and Chicago and Lexington and in other places.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.081" offset="11251649">It involves solely the question of whether these two banks, the Federal, Girard, and the Philadelphia National Bank in Philadelphia, may properly merge without violation of the Sherman act and if, and whether on the contrary that merger would constitute an improper and excessive diminution in competition in Philadelphia and excess of concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.567" offset="11373589">Those are the only two things charged in the complaint which had been pursued since the original complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.076" offset="11411728">Now the court below, contrary to what has been suggested a moment ago, decided this case purely as a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.679" offset="11446105">This Court is asked to review and to reverse the Court below purely on questions of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.543" offset="11473586">The Court below assumed that the Clayton act applied, but held that it was not violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.244" offset="11504306">It held that the Sherman act applied and decided as a matter of fact that it was not violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.424" offset="11529070">So that, for this Court to reverse, the District Court would require it to declare that the finding of the facts of the court below were clearly erroneous and in order to oppose this subject to the understanding, it's necessary to consider two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.883" offset="11614856">First, what is the need to banking; second, what was the evidence presented to the Court below which led it to the conclusion which it announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.108" offset="11659786">Now, banking is essentially different from general industry, from manufacturing and the complete failure of the Department of Justice to understand and give effect to this difference is probably what is the fundamental basis for this case, and certainly is the fundamental basis for the argument that has been presented, both orally and in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.926" offset="11763127">Now I shall like to say first something about the background situation as it existed in the Philadelphia which led to this merger proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.625" offset="11809834">Until 1950, these two banks were essentially wholesale banks, wholesale is a colloquial term applied to banks which deal in large sums, preferably large deposits and large levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.704" offset="11878170">For example, in the early days the Philadelphia National Bank was probably reluctant to accept a deposit of less than $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.109" offset="11915786">The Girard for many years had only 10,000 depositors and as Girard's have said they now have over 200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.148" offset="11943999">Deposits, individual deposits, and corporate deposits up in the millions of dollars in demand deposits were quite common and it was a bank, or banks which dealt largely in that type of business that were called wholesale banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.617" offset="12005857">They were looked down upon the retail bank business done by the smaller banks because that involved a lot more trouble and handling small amounts of money and large number of deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.776" offset="12050474">However, probably 1933 when it became unlawful to pay interest on the demand deposits, both private depositors and corporate depositors concluded that they shouldn't leave millions of dollars on deposit earning nothing and with the added sophistication of corporate treasures, those moneys were drawn out in large quantities and invested in short-term government bonds, in commercial paper, in time deposit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.623" offset="12201880">So that the demand deposits, for which the bank could not pay any interest were translated so far as they could be into time deposits where they had to pay the interest in order to get them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.383" offset="12256946">The result of that was, that the banks were required, these wholesale banks were required to seek elsewhere for the cash which they had to have to increase their deposit account, because although it was suggested a moment ago that the deposits were not too significant, actually a bank can't exist without deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.955" offset="12335208">It can't do business without deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.159" offset="12343986">Deposits constitute approximately 90% of the resources of a commercial bank and therefore if the deposits were withdrawn the bank would collapse, it couldn't possibly do its business with simply this capital and surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.847" offset="12398738">So that the banks sought this other source of money, and that required it go into the retail business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.874" offset="12438862">That trust could transfer large sums in the aggregate, but small individually to the suburbs of Philadelphia, led the banks to pursue their customers in the suburbs and in the course of doing so they merged with the local country banks who then were too small to handle the influx of business that had come from the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.517" offset="12529455">And together the combination produced a benevolent result as it was testified to by the only witness called by the appellant, who knew anything whatever about Philadelphia, and that was Professor Key.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.637" offset="12569893">He said these mergers were beneficial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.565" offset="12577625">They were necessary in order that the banks might keep up with the growing business in the community and it was good for everybody.</text>

            <text syncTime="3160.567" offset="12745644">I can do it very briefly by saying that the banks, as business grew, the small banks became totally incapable of handing and they lost business and could only stay alive at all by merging with a larger bank, that's the point of view of the smaller bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.601" offset="12813772">The point of view with a large moving into the country, it was the only way it could get into the surrounding area because of the restrictions upon opening new branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.678" offset="12850134">So that it was not only a marriage of convenience but of a great advantage to both and it resulted in the diminution of the number of banks, but a great increase in the number of branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.020" offset="12895483">So, that there are now some 300 branches in the four-county area and although there were fewer banks, only 17 banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.802" offset="12934562">Along with this movement of the country and the growth of activities locally, there was a great improvement in the business situation in Philadelphia and its surroundings so that the amount of business that required banking accommodation greatly increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.902" offset="13015019">That is shown with the exhibits in the case, in the growth of business in the surrounding area but there was a great lag in the growth of banks so that the largest banks in Philadelphia became totally unable to handle the business which came to them by virtue of they being in the same area and these big businesses which had outgrown the local banks then were forced to go and did go to many cities, but smaller than Philadelphia but which had banks larger than Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.572" offset="13129644">For example Pittsburgh, which had a bank then with a $25 million lending limit which was produced by mergers incidentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.585" offset="13165693">There is a bank in Boston which had $20 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.873" offset="13178859">There is a bank in Cleveland which has more, Dallas $10 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.632" offset="13193906">So that these business people, went not only to New York in large numbers which has 17 banks with a lending limit in an excess of a $1 million, but they went to these other cities as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.679" offset="13242075">There were 41 banks in Philadelphia, the four-county area, handling all the local business, but the large business went elsewhere because it couldn't be handled locally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.837" offset="13286693">Now, banking is essentially different from commerce or the manufacturing business itself and it is this that should be -- is recognized by the Court below following the guide that was given to it by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.101" offset="13351790">When the Congress had before it this Bank Merger Act of 1960, the house report says, banking offers problems acutely different from other types of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.978" offset="13399333">The Senate report said, it's impossible to require unrestricted competition in the field of banking and impossible to subject banks to the rules applicable to ordinary industrial and commercial concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.786" offset="13450533">And Senator Robinson who is the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency said, banking is too important to permit unrestricted competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.992" offset="13491388">It is impossible to subject bank mergers to the Clayton act under which a merger would be barred if it might tend substantially to lessen competition regardless of the effects on the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.666" offset="13542066">And it was that approach that led the comptroller to reach the conclusion which he did, and which is now challenged not on the ground stated by Congress as the reasons why merger should be allowed but on this very limited statistical approach of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.998" offset="13619388">The fundamental difference between banking and manufacturing is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.081" offset="13643734">When a bank lends all the money that is in the till it has to quit, it can't make any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.165" offset="13676022">It's not the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.472" offset="13685217">It can't continue to manufacture money and unless it gets more deposits which are purely the voluntary act of some private individual or a company, it has to go out in lending business until the loans are paid off or until more deposits come in and that's because the deposits are 90% of the resources that were available to any bank to lend to it's customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.341" offset="13784691">Only 10% is due to the capital and surplus of the bank but 90% to the deposits and therefore it is completely dependent upon the uncontrolled will of depositors who can come and go as they please and do as they please.</text>
