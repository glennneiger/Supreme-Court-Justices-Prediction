            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="25.092" offset="203734">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.483" offset="221288">This case, and I will treat it as a single case for most purposes, raises the question whether the Government, prior to the resentencing of two defendants in a criminal case, may appeal the orders directing that the resentencing take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.904" offset="299029">This case originated in 1954 when three men were arrested in connection with an attempted mail robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.630" offset="333928">These men were Albert Andrews, Robert Donovan, and Hyman Cohen.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.192" offset="352110">Mr. Cohen is no long in -- no longer involved in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.764" offset="370395">They were convicted on all three counts in a trial before Judge Lawrence Walsh in the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.908" offset="399026">They were convicted, that is, of assaulting a post office employee with an attempt to rob with putting the life of the same post office employee in jeopardy by the use of a dangerous weapon and of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.871" offset="454823">Now immediately upon conviction and apparently without any presentence required of law and without asking the defendants whether they had anything to say either in mitigation of sentence or on their own behalf, Judge Walsh sentenced all three of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.583" offset="521697">Counts 1 and 2 merged so there was no sentence on those -- on the first count.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.912" offset="539042">On the second count, he gave them the mandatory 25 years, and on the third count, he gave them five years to run concurrently with the 25-year sentence.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="123.465" offset="597243">Well, the appeal on the case was not heard until 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.179" offset="616051">The record doesn't show why there was that delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.711" offset="626186">I have inquired of both Mr. Healey and Mr. Friedman to determine and their answer is that due to some difficulties about payments in the in forma pauperis petitions and various other things, it simply drifted on that long.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.625" offset="689821">Now, the Second Circuit affirmed the convictions, but remanded for resentencing because Judge Walsh had erroneously thought that he could not grant probation on the mandatory count.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.812" offset="742588">Now notice that the remand for resentencing was specifically for the purpose of determining whether probation could be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.888" offset="778951">It was in the light of his right to grant probation that that remand took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.790" offset="802565">The resentencing was first scheduled for May 15, 1957, deferred for five days so that one of the counsels could prepare legal memo.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.275" offset="844466">On May 28th, it was called for resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.329" offset="856691">Now note that this was almost two and a half years after the original sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.923" offset="879052">Judge Walsh again presided.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.499" offset="889396">The defendants were not present, neither was Mr. Frank Healey, an attorney representing Mr. Donovan.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.527" offset="921475">The proceedings nevertheless commenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.872" offset="934849">Mr. Friedman made an argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.374" offset="940910">Now Mr. Friedman's representation in this case is not entirely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.713" offset="966196">He told the -- he told Judge Walsh that at this particular point because Mr. Healey was not present that he represented all three defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.067" offset="1003604">The docket entries show and the judgment show that he represented only Mr. Andrews and Mr. Cohen, and that Mr. Healey who was now absent represented Mr. Donovan.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.186" offset="1052087">In any event, he told Judge Walsh that he had not been able to prepare the memo which he had hoped he would and he then argued two points, remember now this is in the absence of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.120" offset="1103809">He argued first a legal point.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.244" offset="1112377">That is that the first and second counts didn't merge and therefore the Court could grant some sort of sentence on Count 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.588" offset="1141739">Secondly, he argued a non-legal point.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.776" offset="1150516">He made a plea for clemency.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.534" offset="1165458">Now Mr. Mathews, the Assistant United States Attorney then presented an argument that the first and second counts did merge and Judge Walsh at that point called a recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.701" offset="1210180">After the recess, the defendants and Mr. Healey were present for the first time during this resentencing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.615" offset="1241840">Judge Walsh asked, “Is there anything you want to say?”</text>
            <text syncTime="289.906" offset="1262947">And this question was answered not by the defendant, not by Mr. Friedman, not by Mr. Healey, but by the Assistant United States Attorney, Mr. Mathews who then proceeded to give his version of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.387" offset="1320939">He said the Government did not have much background on these men but he noted that the Court at this point had a presentence report, apparently, the first one in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.550" offset="1365556">When Mr. Mathews concluded, Mr. Friedman, without being asked then spoke up, saying that he was going to speak with respect to Andrews and Cohen and that Mr. Healey would speak with respect to Donovan.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.995" offset="1423339">Mr. Friedman made a plea for clemency for Andrews and Cohen, and Mr. Healey also without being asked by the Court spoke up and made a plea for Mr. Donovan.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.972" offset="1467225">When they were through, despite the fact that the whole purpose of the resentencing was to consider probation, that was the point of the remand, the Court did not ask any defendant whether he had anything to say either in litigation sentence or on his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.092" offset="1539741">He simply proceeded to resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.903" offset="1551026">He suspended Mr. Cohen's sentence and put him on probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.864" offset="1570879">He ordered the prior 25-year sentences of Andrews and Donovan to remain in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.343" offset="1608704">On April 17, 1961, Donovan filed a motion in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.290" offset="1636498">He claimed that his right of allocution under Rule 32 (a) had been denied him and he prayed, “that the sentence aforesaid be vacated and he be resentenced.”</text>
            <text syncTime="396.633" offset="1689893">In three supporting papers, he specifically requested that this motion of his be treated as a Rule 35 motion.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="408.835" offset="1738689">Well, of course part of his delay was his fault in the sense that there was a delay between the resentencing and his filing of this motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.905" offset="1770977">I'd like to point out however, that I think that is accounted for by the fact that the Green case had not been decided at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.958" offset="1799189">The Green case was decided four or five months before he filed his petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.021" offset="1815489">And I think frankly, this was the first time he knew he had any such right, and that's when he filed his -- his petition because up until this time, neither at the original sentencing nor at the resentencing did anybody ask him whether he had anything to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.970" offset="1879228">Now Rule 35, of course, reads in part, the Court may correct an illegal sentence at anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.964" offset="1903261">The docket entry shows that Donovan's motion was entered as a Rule 35 motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.560" offset="1925622">The Court -- the Government stated twice in pleadings -- in pleading that it was a Rule 35 motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.122" offset="1959894">And Judge Murphy granted the motion as made ordering that Donovan “be returned to this District for resentencing”.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.200" offset="2004198">Now Andrews apparently heard of this because he wrote the Court a letter under date of January 25th, 1961, asking for what he understood to be the same treatment that had been accorded Donovan.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.015" offset="2055398">Judge Murphy treated this letter as a motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.301" offset="2068564">He granted it and he ordered that Andrews be resentenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.096" offset="2091760">Now, note that neither Andrews nor Judge Murphy, nor the docket clerk, made any mention of 28 U.S.C. Section 2255 in relation to this letter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1070.411" offset="4384998">Now, as I say, what the Government says in effect here, I think, is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.600" offset="4405791">Technically, since Judge Murphy properly could only vacate the sentence and since the resentencing will be in the criminal case, this is the last order that will be entered in the 2255 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.408" offset="4465037">That's the way I interpret their brief as trying to call for some element of finality here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.195" offset="4484159">Well, now first, let's assume that this is Rule 35 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.248" offset="4504325">Rule 35 doesn't say the Court may vacate an illegal sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.501" offset="4525328">It says the Court may correct an illegal sentence, and unless the correction is a reduction within 60 days, the defendants have to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.467" offset="4565243">So that it reads as if it's to say -- as if it says, the Court may set aside and order resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.155" offset="4604008">Now under 2255, if that's what this is, the Court as I just pointed out specifically given the power both to correct and to resentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.084" offset="4639744">So I think there can be no question but that Judge Murphy had the power to vacate and to order resentencing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.826" offset="4670673">Now secondly, I don't concede that other things couldn't happen in this 2255 proceeding, assuming that that's what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.711" offset="4698258">If his order for example were not followed -- were not followed up there could be new motions in the 2255 proceeding and thirdly, even if the 2255 proceeding, if that's what it is, were now over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.627" offset="4757922">That is not what this Court has said the finality means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.876" offset="4774849">In Collins versus Miller, final orders were entered in the sense asked for by the Government here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.403" offset="4804942">But this Court held that they were not final, a further extradition hearing had to be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.795" offset="4834513">The whole subject matter, that was the -- that was the phrase used by the Court; the whole subject matter had not been disposed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.281" offset="4868472">Now, similar holdings had been made in cases citing on -- cited on pages 20 to 23 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.367" offset="4900864">And so here, Judge Murphy's orders will not be final until what he ordered to be done is done.</text>

            <text syncTime="1481.980" offset="6031339">I mean I don't see that you -- that you convert this into a legal appeal because they walk in and get a stay of an order from which they cannot appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.216" offset="6076270">Now, I'd like the Court to look at what the Government is really asking it to do here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.082" offset="6103751">Let's suppose that the petitioners after they had been convicted by the jury, but before they had been sentenced, had rushed in with a habeas corpus petition attacking their conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.808" offset="6170624">Now, is there any question but that an appellate court assuming that that was denied, let's assume it was denied so they try to take an appeal, they say it's the final order, is there any question but that an appellate court would dismiss the appeal on the ground that this was a non-final proceeding, that this was non-final in every way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.367" offset="6244812">If that, I -- I think that is precisely what the Government is asking you to rule here in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.619" offset="6269889">The Government says that even though had they -- have yet to be resentenced, it can rush in an appeal because an order has been entered in the 2255 proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.803" offset="6310536">If it can, if the Government can appeal here, I can assure you that there's going to be a great revision in collateral attack procedures, not only by the Government, but by petitioners, but by defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.076" offset="6371662">The whole purpose -- the whole purpose and thrust of Carroll and DiBella is going to be diluted completely.</text>

            <text syncTime="1790.534" offset="7265468">Now it's quite true that the concluding paragraph in Your Honors opinion in Hill versus United States intimates that Rule 35 is not the proper remedy even where they're aggravating circumstances to accompany the denial of the right of allocution, but even Hill doesn't suggest that Judge Murphy's orders were void.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.690" offset="7362121">Moreover with great respect, I think the Court should reconsider the question in Hill as to whether this should not be a Rule 35 order, a Rule 35 motion, whether Rule 35 doesn't properly lie here as a remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1909.543" offset="7741524">The majority in Hill seems to have assumed that Rule 35 traditionally has been used to attack only sentences void on their face whereas 2255 is traditionally been used in situations more akin to this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.941" offset="7811114">But Rule -- but 2255 as I've said by its own terms, doesn't apply to this situation because these men are not seeking to be released from custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.767" offset="7846431">Moreover, it's traditionally been used to attack the judgment of conviction which is not being attacked here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.871" offset="7894810">Moreover, the Government itself does not dispute some cases where the absence of the defendant was a ground for Rule 35 relief, on page 14 of its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.318" offset="7952593">It seems to me that the real rule in relation to Rule 35 is that strongly intimated in Heflin and that is that Rule 35 maybe used to attack the legality of any sentence unless, unless that the effect does not appear from the face of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.245" offset="8016332">In other words, unless a hearing must be held to determine the true facts and no hearing was necessary here and none withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.133" offset="8051858">If the Court finds it necessary to reach this question, as I hope it will not, I hope that it will reconsider its concluding paragraph in Hill at least where aggravating circumstances are present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.310" offset="8100655">Rule 35, I contend was quite as appropriate a method as 2255 to do what was done here and as a matter of fact was so far neater and more expeditious method of doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.864" offset="8146840">Now, there's a third independent ground for reversal here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.912" offset="8167006">If the Court should find that Judge Murphy's orders were interlocutory, if it should find further that the orders were not entered in the criminal case, then and only then, we reach the question of whether his orders were correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.515" offset="8221445">Now, first, let me say that they were clearly correct at the time that they were entered because at that time, Green had been decided and eight members of this Court clearly thought that Rule 35 was the appropriate remedy because that was a Rule 35 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.846" offset="8282781">Now Hill had not been decided and even under Hill, which was later decided, Judge Murphy, I think was right in his result because this case contains a number of the so-called aggravating circumstances of a fundamental nature and Hill recognizes that some -- such circumstances came relay the sentence open to collateral attack.</text>

            <text syncTime="2252.610" offset="9113788">It certainly is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.184" offset="9120057">Your Honor, in Green, I think that the Court with great respect, I think it was sort of shall we say assuming quite a bit in terms of the question that was asked and who it was asked off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.440" offset="9177109">But in Green at least the Court said, when you ask -- when you ask a question and it's answered by the defense attorney, it's easy to see how that attorn -- that question could be answered by defendants and then the attorneys in effect are saying, “We'll speak for them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.145" offset="9239907">But it seems to me it's inconceivable to assume that a question could be asked of the defendants, “Do you have anything to say” And the man who answers the question and who speaks up in effect on their behalf is the Assistant United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.188" offset="9292152">So that's what I base it on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.300" offset="9312528">Now, I've covered in my brief and my reply brief and I will not reargue here such matters as Mr. Healey's absence during part of the resentencing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.234" offset="9348263">I'm now talking about aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.151" offset="9363937">Judge Walsh's mistake of fact as to Andrews' part in the crime, Mr. Donovan's record, the failure to grant the right of allocution at the first sentencing, and things of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.823" offset="9414614">I want to add here only a few remarks about the absence of the defendants during this resentencing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.563" offset="9445648">It seems to me that Rules 43 and 32 are not separate rules, but complementary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.732" offset="9474278">Rule 43 provides that the defendant must be present at every stage of the trial and at the imposition of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.779" offset="9502490">Rule 32 guarantees him the right to speak in mitigation of sentence and in his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.500" offset="9529344">Now I think that these rules recognize that there's no point in the defendant being present if he can't speak, and that his right to speak is meaningless if he wasn't present at every stage of what went before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.243" offset="9592351">These petitioners were denied both rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.457" offset="9605204">They missed a legal argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.870" offset="9610846">They missed a plea for clemency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.812" offset="9618578">They had never spoken at their original sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.884" offset="9630908">They have not spoken to this day more than eight years after they originally sentenced them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.343" offset="9652746">Surely, I think that they're entitled to what Judge Murphy has ordered that they'd be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.422" offset="9673017">Now in conclusion, Your Honor, I just have one comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.851" offset="9686810">I pointed out on page 15 on my reply brief that according to the administrative office of the United States courts, of the almost 600 motions to set aside are correct sentences filed during fiscal 1962 under both 2255 and Rule 35, only 18 resulted in the granting of some form of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.973" offset="9771238">Now subsequent to my reply brief, I have the administrative office check to determine how many Government appeals were taken or attempted in any of these actions and I might say that I have informed Mr. Barnett the results of that request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.255" offset="9836440">There were 169 appeals taken during fiscal 1962.</text>
