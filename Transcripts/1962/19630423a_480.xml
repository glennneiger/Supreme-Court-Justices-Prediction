            <text syncTime="27.311" offset="212616">This is a school segregation case brought under the Civil Rights Act Section 1983, pursuant to the judicial code Title 28 Section 1343 subparagraph 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.924" offset="267055">The allegation of the complaint in substance is that the plaintiff-children had been compelled to attend racially segregated public schools and that this violates their rights to due process of law and to equal protection of the law as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.429" offset="337063">The plaintiffs are Negro elementary school children who reside in Centreville, Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.337" offset="360678">Now, Centreville is a city just outside of East St. Louis in Southern Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.285" offset="380531">And they attend the Chenot Elementary School which is one of several elementary schools operated by the defendants and the Community Unit School District Number 187.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.439" offset="425148">It is at this school that the defendants maintain separate classes for white and Negro students in the same school building, and it is also in this school that Negro children are required to use separate entrances to and exits from the school building from those used by the white children.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.190" offset="496097">Now, the Chenot School is relatively new.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.083" offset="503724">It was opened in the year 1957 at the opening of the school year.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.510" offset="521383">Now, the complaint alleges that this school was planned and built and its attendance area boundaries were intentionally drawn by the defendants so as to make it an all-Negro school in the students enrolled.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.727" offset="570284">Now, the presence of the white children in the school at the present time was something that happened subsequent to that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.576" offset="589720">In fact, and as alleged in the complaint, all children of elementary-school-age who reside within the Chenot attendance area are Negroes.</text>

            <text syncTime="164.437" offset="761083">Now, subsequent to the opening of the Chenot School in 1957, there were white children who were transferred into there from the adjacent Centreville school area but, prior to the opening of the Chenot School, the Negro children who were assigned there all attended the Centreville Elementary School which was also attended by white children.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.391" offset="856900">However, at that time, the defendants achieved the segregation by requiring all Negro children to attend classes in the afternoons exclusively while the white children attended school in the mornings exclusively.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.945" offset="1027114">Now, since 1957 and because of overcrowding at the adjacent Centreville School, certain fifth and sixth grade classes only were transferred to the Chenot School Building.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.072" offset="1079672">Now, these classes consisted of approximately 97% white students and 3% Negro students.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.002" offset="1107362">Now, upon being transferred to the Chenot school harbor, they became students and were carried on the roles as being students of the Chenot School and their teachers were carried on the role as faculty members of the Chenot Elementary School.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.218" offset="1156263">However, the complaint alleges that these classes were maintained intact while at this Chenot School in pursuance of the defendants' plan to maintain separate classes are racially for white and Negro students.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.245" offset="1216345">Now, this complaint was filed a few days after the opening of the 1961-1962 school year, and it refers specifically to certain statistics from the 1960 and 1961 school year.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.415" offset="1269008">However, the amended complaint does allege that all or substantially all of these same conditions which we allege existed in 1960 and 1961 were true for the then-current school year, and we submit that this is a sufficient answer to the point which is raised by the respondents in this connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.975" offset="1335254">Now, as alleged in the complaint, at this particular time, there were 251 Negro students and 254 white students.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.529" offset="1365452">All the white students and eight of the Negro students were in the classes which were transferred from the Centreville School.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.305" offset="1400560">There were 10 classes with only Negro students and there were 3 classes with only white students.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.449" offset="1425220">The other 5 classes of the total of 18 had 8 Negro students who were divided along with about 146 white students.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.158" offset="1460015">Now, except for these eight, all the Negro students attended classes in one part of the school building while all the white children attended -- Negro children attended classes in the other part of the building and, further, they were compelled to use different entrances to and exits from the same school building.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.781" offset="1534516">The complaint further alleges that these facts continue to exist through the then-current school year despite request, demands, and pleas to the defendants to cease and desist from their actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.612" offset="1577775">It further alleged that the defendants were acting to perpetuate such a racially segregated public school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.720" offset="1606301">The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the original complaint and leave of court was granted to file an amended complaint.</text>

            <label>Mr. Raymond E. Harth</label>
            <text syncTime="383.575" offset="1637648">The complaint asked for relief of a declaratory judgment declaring the policies of the defendants violated the constitutional rights of the plaintiff-children.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.052" offset="1671607">It asked for an injunction to restrain the defendants from further violating the constitutional rights, and it asked that the Court order the defendants to submit a plan for desegregating their district.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.675" offset="1722075">The motion to dismiss was extended to attack the amended complaint and, in substance, the motion to dismiss said that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because the plaintiffs had not exhausted certain procedures under an Illinois law, referring specifically to Section 22-19 of the Illinois School Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.263" offset="1812459">Now, that Act provides, in substance, that upon the filing with the State Superintendent of Public Instruction of a complaint signed by 50 persons or 10% of the residents of the school district, whichever number happen to be the smaller, alleging that any pupil has been excluded from or segregated in a school because of his race, that the State Superintendent, on receiving such a complaint, was required to set a date for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.069" offset="1923636">It also provided that the State Superintendent may set a date for a hearing whenever he has reason to believe any such discrimination may exist in a school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.022" offset="1959476">The statute provides for representation of the parties by counsel for cross-examination, subpoenaing witnesses, and for the taking of depositions, as in other civil actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.254" offset="2000436">Now, following the hearing -- and this is a significant part of the statute, following the hearing before the State Superintendent, he must decide whether the allegations of the complaint are substantially correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.100" offset="2055816">Now, this is all that he can do after such a complaint is filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.362" offset="2068773">He can only determine whether the allegations are, and I quote from the statute, “substantially correct” and if he does so determine, he shall request, and the statute provides and I'm quoting from the statute, “he shall request the Attorney General to apply to the appropriate Circuit Court for such injunctive or other relief as may be necessary to rectify the practices complained of.”</text>
            <text syncTime="513.664" offset="2158007">It gives him no power, no authority to issue any cease and desist orders to the local school board who he might have found has committed acts of racial segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.542" offset="2201579">All he can do is ask the Attorney General to institute an action in the Circuit Court revealing in the final analysis, of course, that this is really judicial and not administrative.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.167" offset="2244002">The plaintiffs responded to this motion by asserting that the actions being brought under the provisions of the Civil Rights Act need not be preceded by the exhaustion of state remedies, and that the remedies referred to by the defendants were neither administrative, adequate, or available.</text>

            <text syncTime="713.306" offset="2956622">The Fourth Circuit, in its cases, is dealing with a remedy which is called a Pupil Placement Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.940" offset="2983163">Now, it seems to me that what those cases are saying is that these Acts, having been passed after the decision of this Court in Brown versus Board of Education, appear to be constitutional on their faces but -- and appear to provide a method whereby students could be assigned to schools on a non-discriminatory basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.107" offset="3055783">And so, they say in those cases, it seems to me, that before you can show that the state officials have discriminated against you, you must apply for admission to school in accordance with those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.910" offset="3094967">Now, I might point out some of the later cases involving Pupil Placement Acts in the Fourth Circuit have found that the application of those statutes has been unconstitutional and has -- these cases upheld that they need not be complied with it but this is because the Acts have been unconstitutionally applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.149" offset="3168005">The principal issue therefore presented by this case is one which this Court has not previously decided and the various Circuits are in conflict on this particular point and litigation proliferates and, probably, substantive rights of the plaintiffs in these cases go without adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.386" offset="3232893">For example, in the southern and border states alone, more than 293 court cases had been filed in state and federal courts on school segregation as of November 1962.</text>

            <text syncTime="824.654" offset="3401958">Now, a number of these cases have been going back and forth in the lower federal courts because of a good deal of confusion in this very area that is presented by this case as to whether or not, in a civil rights action against school segregation, that it's necessary to exhaust state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.515" offset="3477400">Now, this action is based on the Civil Rights Act Section 1983 which provides for a civil action for deprivation of constitutional rights under the color of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="889.172" offset="3660048">And, the other part of that one was that there was a state judicial remedy, but the Court said, in referring to Monroe versus Pape, in referring to that fact, that the fact that there is such a remedy is no bar to relief because the federal remedy is supplementary to the state remedy and need not be first sought and reviewed before the federal right is invoked.</text>

            <text syncTime="929.356" offset="3820753">The complaint here charges that the plaintiff-children had been deprived of due process of law and equal protection of the law by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.315" offset="3848652">And, the principal issue then, it seems, is whether any suit under the Civil Rights Act seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the maintenance of a racially segregated school system or whether the plaintiffs must, first, seek a remedy provided by the state before suing in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.332" offset="3924720">Now, we submit that the answer to this is and must necessarily be in the negative because the complaint here alleges, among other things, maintaining separated classes and facilities for white and Negro pupils in the same school.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.085" offset="3971741">Now, that such allegation is sufficient to show a deprivation of equal protection of the law is clear from this Court's decision many years ago in the McLaurin versus Oklahoma State Regents and, further, the complaint alleges that the defendants have manipulated the attendance area lines in order to make the Chenot School an all-Negro school.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.915" offset="4043003">And, again, these allegations are sufficient, as shown by the decision of Taylor versus Board of Education of New Rochelle which this Court denied certiorari and, I might also point out by comparison, the case of Chameleon versus Lightwood recently decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.528" offset="4109458">But the Court of Appeals has held that the allegations are not sufficient to allege School Board Acts which are unconstitutional in themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.308" offset="4140596">As to this, we submit that the lower Court is clearly in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.961" offset="4159195">The Court went on to say that, since the allegations were insufficient to allege cons -- Acts which are unconstitutional in themselves, we must, therefore, allege the exhaustion of the state remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.652" offset="4206007">Now, there is no doctrine of invoking state administrative remedies or any administrative remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1332.650" offset="5433971">Now, the defendants, in moving to dismiss, of course admit all facts of the complaint which are well pleaded and what they are saying, therefore, is that we admit that we planned and built the Chenot School to make it an all-Negro school and that we did this by drawing its attendance area boundaries so as to make it conform to the Negro residential area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.812" offset="5514637">We admit further that prior to 1957 that Negro children were made to attend classes in the afternoons while the white children attended schools in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.906" offset="5547029">And we further admit that we are maintaining separate classes for white and Negro children in the same school and make them use different entrances and exits, but what the defendants further say is that there is nothing that a federal court can do about this until the plaintiffs have asked the State Superintendent of Public Instruction to correct what we have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.760" offset="5626441">But, the defendants' position ignores the clear and explicit language of the statutes which give the federal court jurisdiction of this case and which give rise to this action, Section 1983 of the Civil Rights Act and Section 1343 of the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.286" offset="5688508">Now, the effect of the decision below is that a state may encumber or limit this federal jurisdiction which is granted by passing a statute which appears to grant a remedy because the opinions assume that the exhaustion of state administrative remedies or state remedies is jurisdictional and an absolute prerequisite to the exercise of federal judicial powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.696" offset="5782131">Now, if such a view is upheld, I submit that there would be a complete abdication of federal judicial responsibility which would deprive the petitioners of a federal forum completely and remitting them to the remedies made available by the State with the implied invitation, of course, to return if relief is not secured from the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.501" offset="5849422">Now, indeed, if such is to be the rule, then access to federal courts, to a remedy to school segregation could be effectively blocked particularly in those states where, as a matter of common knowledge, there is a strong desire to maintain the status quo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.895" offset="5910967">Now, this Court recently had occasion to consider the legislative history of Section 1983 which gives rise to this action and consider the issue on existence of a state remedy, and that was the case of Monroe versus Pape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.431" offset="5957047">I might point out further that the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan in the case of Monroe versus Pape, considering this very same question in the extent to which the Congress intended to give a federal remedy, stated as follows: “the statute becomes more than a jurisdictional provision only if one attributes to the enacting legislature a view that a deprivation of a constitutional right is significantly different from and more serious than a violation of a state right and, therefore, deserves a different remedy, even though the same Act may constitute of a state tort in the deprivation of a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.657" offset="6098004">Now, while the Court there was talking about a tort action brought by an individual, the same basic reasoning, I would think, would hold true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.089" offset="6127679">The existence of a state remedy is no bar to the federal remedy which is provided by a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.265" offset="6152443">The Court considered the debates in the legislative history of Section 1983 and of Section 1343, and it found that the spirits of tho -- the spirit of those Acts was the access to the federal courts for redress of civil rights was not to be delayed by the availability or non-availability of state remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="2386.764" offset="9650448">And that's made clear in the complaint and these other things given by Mr. Harth today or cited as an example of, and then they delineate those various charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.045" offset="9703528">But the complaint, if one reads the complaint, we'll see it is an attack upon the neighborhood school of policy as such and since the Chenot School District is in the area where there is a predominance or where I think it's all coming from probably, and it's colored board of the south, and the Centreville School that they speak of then there is a mixture in residential housing of the two races.</text>

            <text syncTime="2540.512" offset="10265370">We equate the school district with the City of Chicago in Monroe versus Pape which directly held that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2556.490" offset="10329318">So, we think that although the ground was not urged below by anybody, it was not contended that they were support by Monroe versus Pape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.983" offset="10387310">The fact of the matter is, when this case was filed, Monroe versus Pape was still in the advance sheets.</text>

            <text syncTime="2785.203" offset="11244231">And, the brief goes on and does say, in effect, that if one considers either the point have been waived or, if the Court would consider this without regard to form that there, the Court should take cognizance of the Illinois statute, which we claim to be adequate, and require that petitioners to use that in those means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.717" offset="11346213">Now, the Courts of Appeals in the Fourth Circuit and in the Eighth Circuit have required that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.211" offset="11384247">And the Court of Appeals (Inaudible) in a series of cases, has frequently not required that and we have pointed out, and I think it's obvious there that the administrative remedy being considered was usually something that was far from adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.610" offset="11473795">It would be a vain and a useless thing to require them to go through that sort of useless procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.150" offset="11503992">Now, in Illinois, the segregation in the public schools has been unconstitutional since the adoption of the Constitution, which I believe was in 1872, and the Court in 1901 especially -- specifically rejected a separate but equal interpretation of our Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.316" offset="11612662">And the School Code of Illinois has, for a long time, prohibited a school district from being excluded or segregated according to color.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.442" offset="11661145">Furthermore, the School Code for many years, what is now the School Code, has made it a criminal offense for any school officer or other person to exclude from the public schools on account of color any child and -- or anybody who threatens or intimidates or menaces that child in pursuing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.950" offset="11763127">Now, those statutes have preceded your Brown versus the Board of Education by a good number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.048" offset="11799594">The legislature has attempted to put more teeth in those things in the postwar years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.907" offset="11826970">And, in one of those, they provided, first, by a writer to an Appropriation Bill and, later, in substantive law that no school could participate in state funds as long as there was a practice of discrimination in the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.203" offset="11904188">And, in Illinois, at least the school district of this type, the lands on state funds is vital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.562" offset="11933654">About 25% of the budget comes from the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.758" offset="11950373">And it is required that a school official verify annually with a claim for state money that there has not in fact been a violation of the segregation provisions of the School Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.606" offset="12021844">Now, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, as the state official, he has the duty of transmitting to the state dispersing official these claims for the several school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.988" offset="12087359">In fact the law says that he shall certify those and the auditor of public accounts would not pay out any money without that certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.789" offset="12122572">That's an important point in our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.774" offset="12142425">The same official, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, is the party who is required to hold the hearings under Section 22-19, upon the receipt of a petition signed by 50 voters or more, or who may initiate the proceeding on his own motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.261" offset="12240436">And the proceeding that's outlined in the statute which maybe begun like that is fairly simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.371" offset="12268857">He may appoint a hearing officer, take evidence, and make a finding as to whether or not the complaint was justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.233" offset="12308355">Now, we stop at that point and say that is sufficient, as far as the use of Section 22-19 goes, to ensure the rights of the petitioners because it is inconceivable that in a state where segregation is unconstitutional, and whether statute after statute in favor of the policy of non-segregation, that a state official who makes a finding that there is segregation in School District Number 187, he could not, the next day, certify the request for funds to that same school district and close his eyes to the fact that there was the thing that prevents them from getting the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.566" offset="12525589">Now, that is as close, I think, as one will ever find to an adequate remedy and was the purpose of it, of course, to have these rights adjudicated because the State Superintendent can either, he can block the money which will bring the school district to its knees or he can revoke a certificate of recognition to the school district for the same reason, and that's one of the standards incidentally that he uses, and that would deny the rights of the graduates not to go to university without examinations and rights of the teachers to write some of the Pension Act and host to things of that sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="4335.126" offset="17443924">All I'm saying is you haven't shown that you e -- you have even tried to ask the State to do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4341.308" offset="17468583">At least give the State which has, in the past, given no indication of either a propensity or of affirmative action on their part to deny the rights of Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.057" offset="17527620">Give them a chance and then come back to me later on.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.442" offset="17545174">I think this is not exactly a Monroe versus Pape situation to revert to the question after my colleague by Mr. Justice Douglas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.114" offset="17587806">Monroe versus Pape considered the issue of whether or not you were required to resort to the state remedy and there was no federal remedy in a situa -- under the Civil Rights Act in a situation where what you were complaining about is not a violation of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.658" offset="17670040">And the Court in that case it held that it was very definitely decided in the -- by Congress in enacting the Civil Rights Act that even where the state law would declare the complaint of action to be illegal, still, there was a right to come into federal court under the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.528" offset="17765439">Our question here is entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4417.114" offset="17771813">Our question here basically is this, where a federal judge feels that the State should be given a chance, is he within his proper exercise of judicial discretion in saying, “Gentlemen go to the State and then come back to me”?</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.768" offset="17842448">I don't think, frankly, that Judge Juergens in this case really intended to say “you have no cause of action because you didn't go to the State.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4443.182" offset="17876093">I think what he really intended to say is, “I'm deferring to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.426" offset="17893125">Take a crack at the state remedy and then if you're turned down, either because of the fact that you -- that he requires 50 signatures and doesn't take to the signature of one person or due to the fact that he drags the page out for years so that your remedy will be ineffectual or that he defers it to a state judicial proceeding, then, please, come back here.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4488.876" offset="18058846">He would have said, “I'm n -- just not going to proceed in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.013" offset="18071385">I'm going to hold it in advance then you go to the State and come back here after that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4496.358" offset="18088835">He chose the, let's say, the more serious and the -- what I consider would probably be the less desirable technique of simply dismissing it and say “start your suit over again.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4512.062" offset="18151633">But, I think in his opinion, and he fortunately wrote quite a nice memorandum opinion, he did indicate why he did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.480" offset="18177337">He wanted them to just try, and this is in accordance with the longstanding proce -- practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.159" offset="18212028">We have a lot of -- a long line of decisional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.334" offset="18228746">For example, the famous case of Prentis versus the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad at 211 U.S. 210 which says that, ordinarily, where there is a state administrative procedure, the federal courts will give way to the state procedure and require the exhaustion of the remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.382" offset="18300949">Now, if this is found to be simply a judicial procedure, Mr. Chief Justice, then I would agree with you, then, it doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.164" offset="18328012">This has been utilized only where it is a state administrative procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.377" offset="18356851">And, our answer to that is simply that where you have a state which has been known for years and years to have followed the rule against segregation, against discrimination, where you have no showing whatever that the State Superintendent of Public Education won't be in -- won't inquire properly and will not administratively grant the relief which he has in his control, namely the power of the purse, where he won't do it, then you have a state administrative relief possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.448" offset="18485164">He isn't required to go into Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.846" offset="18494777">That, in other words, is the -- perhaps the ultimate remedy available to him if the local community says, “Well, we're going to operate without any state funds,” and it's rather unlikely that the -- that any state locality is going to operate without 25% of its budget being raised in the form of state funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4624.404" offset="18600939">This Court, in other words, in Monroe versus Pape had simply the question of jurisdiction before it and it held that there -- that they are coequal remedy, the state remedy and the federal remedy under the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.274" offset="18660498">But today, we have a different problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.143" offset="18675963">We've got the question of whether or not the federal courts may defer to the state administrative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4651.344" offset="18708773">And I would not try to reargue Monroe versus Pape.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.069" offset="18735626">I'm pleased that we have such a group of opinions in that case which give a pretty good outline of the problems created.</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.115" offset="18771884">I would simply suggest perhaps that the Court reconsider the points raised by the late Justice Frankfurter in his dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.461" offset="18825174">Those points are -- may I just take a moment to review.</text>
            <text syncTime="4685.134" offset="18843878">First of all, shouldn't there be a proper distinction created or isn't it possible that a distinction should be created in a mind of a federal judge exercising his discretion as to where in cases that exist, and this Court is fully familiar with them, in the south where it's perfectly clear that the state authorities and the state legislature certainly does not intend that the -- that relief be given and where the state law actually sanctions, in many cases, the discriminatory actions complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="4722.646" offset="18993925">And, on the other hand, a state such as Illinois, where this certainly is not the case, where the state authorities are bound by their oaths to uphold not only the federal constitution but the constitution and the laws of the State of Illinois which have, for years, said that discrimination is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.112" offset="19075845">Secondly, it has been suggested by Mr. Harth that there are 263 cases pending in the south covering this type of problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4756.674" offset="19130075">There are many cases pending in the North.</text>
            <text syncTime="4758.801" offset="19138539">However, I have been able to calculate the number.</text>
            <text syncTime="4763.114" offset="19155780">They just aren't listed anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.257" offset="19168423">It is a principle of judicial administration that the effectiveness, particularly of a judicial remedy in the federal courts, is inversely proportional with the frequency of its exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.874" offset="19230908">It seems to me that Justice Frankfurter, in mentioning that, had in mind that, if possible, the federal courts should, particularly in the field of public schools, keep their intervention to a minimum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4797.490" offset="19293288">This Court recognized in the Brown case, and has recognized in other cases since then, that the problems existing in the public school sys -- public school cases are much more difficult probably than any other area under the Fourteenth Amendment because, here, you simply do not have the problem relating, “Yes, admit this man to a college” or the case that came up last week, “Yes, let these people enter the public parks.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.289" offset="19416482">Here, you have a problem of drawing new districts -- new school districts, and the problems are fantastic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4834.437" offset="19441142">And, I believe that not only Justice Frankfurter, but Judge Juergens recognized the seriousness of these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.212" offset="19476250">Third, public school education is basically a question for determination by the state authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4852.507" offset="19513448">They had -- this is clearly a state function and I feel that Justice Frankfurter, in suggesting that, had in mind that if it were at all possible, if there appear to be any likelihood that relief would be obtained in the State, that likelihood should be exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.748" offset="19578337">And here, there's no indication in the record whatever that it would not be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.607" offset="19605817">Of course, I would add another point to those mentioned by Justice Frankfurter, namely that as we see it --</text>

            <text syncTime="5436.580" offset="21849736">Let me say, in connection with what Mr. Justice Harlan said, that this Court itself in Cooper versus Aaron said this, “Every state legislator and executive and judicial officer is solemnly committed by oath taken pursuant to Article 6 paragraph 3 to support the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5456.950" offset="21931133">No state legislator or executive or judicial officer can war against the Constitution without violating his undertaking to support it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5464.546" offset="21961540">In other words, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction has a responsibility here, in the same manner as the federal agencies who hand out funds to the States under the National Defense Education Act and the other Acts providing for federal assistance require that there not be discrimination in the areas where they do give such money.</text>
            <text syncTime="5487.884" offset="22054954">There is no reason why the State Superintendent of education should not follow the same rule and will not follow the same rule in carrying out his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.683" offset="22094137">Now, here are the things which I would like to point out in conclusion which we do not want and which we do want.</text>
            <text syncTime="5505.606" offset="22125798">We would not be pleased with a decision which said that, in all cases, a federal court must defer to a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5515.828" offset="22166653">This could be used, we feel, by jurisdiction which really had in mind delaying, if not completely eliminating, any possibility of segregation being excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="5526.311" offset="22208658">Nor, would we be pleased with the decision that the discretion of the federal courts in this matter is absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5535.104" offset="22243767">On the other hand, we do feel that where there is no showing of the predisposition on the part of the state to frustrate adheres to the Fourteenth Amendment, the state authorities who are principally charged with the administration of the educational system of the State should be given an opportunity to work them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5554.478" offset="22321298">As pointed out last week in connection with the Memphis case, this is the serious -- this is the most serious area of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.202" offset="22360168">This is the area where there are a number of fiscal, economic, transportation, and social problems involved in any determination that's made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5574.395" offset="22400920">And, in this type of determination, we feel that the state, where the -- where, in our view incidentally, the Board of Education not only of the state and the -- but the Board of Education of the locality which are not involved in -- under the Civil Rights Act, we say, could be brought into this situation where they could sit down and be asked to work these things out, a judicial procedure is simply not the proper kind of a procedure for the determination of such thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="5688.570" offset="22857644">The first complaint was accompanied by petition for a temporary injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="5761.065" offset="23147604">The latest point just raised by Mr. Boman, of course, it's true that the amended complaint was filed on the date this hearing was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="5769.542" offset="23181563">Now, he seems to be saying that he now has some regrets about having extended his motion to dismiss to our amended complaint in view of our having withdrawn our the motion for temporary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.562" offset="23221582">However, he has never withdrawn it up to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5783.991" offset="23239346">I might point out too, that the counsel, and both of them, had gone substantially outside of the record and I think that we must confine ourselves to the record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5791.696" offset="23270170">And just as Mr. Justice Goldberg had pointed out that we must take it on the facts as alleged in the record, as alleged and we must take them as being true.</text>
            <text syncTime="5801.022" offset="23307473">Now, first of all, this is not a suit against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5804.349" offset="23320743">This is a suit against a state agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="5807.002" offset="23331401">It is against the local Board of Education whom we claim has discriminated against these defendants, the plaintiffs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.840" offset="23370689">The defendants say that we must, before we can come into a federal court, exhaust state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5822.985" offset="23395349">Now, there are a couple of lower court decisions on this very specific point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5827.237" offset="23412276">In the Fifth Circuit which have to meet with the same problem about a contention that where there was a claim of discrimination, that you would first have to appeal to the State Board -- Superintendent of Education, and that was in the case of Borders v. Rippy where the Court said, that's reported incidentally at 247 F.2d 268, Texas State law gave the Board and the local Superintendent the power to act, and that is of course true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5853.444" offset="23517184">As pointed out in the briefs, the state statutes give the local of Board of Education the power to assign children to school and to draw attendance area lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="5861.148" offset="23548008">The Court went further to say, that in the exercise of such power, they have denied the plaintiffs the right to attend public schools of their choice solely on account of their race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="5871.135" offset="23587924">By such action, the plaintiffs have been denied their constitutional right and they are not required to seek redress from any administrative body before applying to the Courts, and it cited some other cases in support of that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5885.150" offset="23643930">Now, I might point out also that, at this point at least, the neighborhood school policy is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5891.930" offset="23671097">It may become before the Court or the lower court at some time in the future, but it's not before the Court at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5897.105" offset="23691786">What is before the Court at this point is the claim in the complaint that the defendants have intentionally drawn the attendance area lack of boundaries of the Chenot School, this is the only one that is made specific at this point, to make it an all-Negro school in its student enroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="5916.493" offset="23769318">Now, the -- Mr. Boman so -- seemed to me that he conceded that under these facts that we alleged, that we are entitled to some type of equitable action.</text>
            <text syncTime="5925.560" offset="23805576">Well, actually, this is all that we are seeking in this complaint, is equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5929.342" offset="23820727">We are asking for declaratory judgment and for an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5933.494" offset="23837341">Now, the -- this Act is based on 1983 and on Section 13-43 subparagraph (3) of the Judicial Code which provides a right for violation of Fourteenth Amendment guarantees and which is exactly what we have in this case, claim of the denial of due process of law and of equal protection of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5954.337" offset="23920724">He referred also to decisions in the Eighth Circuit referring, I assume, specifically to the case of Parham versus Dove, being one in support of their proposition that administrative remedies would have to be exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5965.969" offset="23967222">But even in Parham versus Dove, the Court of Appeals in reversing the case directed the lower Court to issue an injunction to restrain the defendants for maintaining a racially segregated school system, but what it said was that the individual plaintiffs in that case, because of the dual nature of a class action, that is for the protection of the individual rights of the individual plaintiffs and for the protection of the rights of the class as a whole, it directed that there'd be an issuance of an injunction to protect the rights of the class as a whole but said that, before the Court can determine whether the individual plaintiffs are entitled to relief, they must apply under the Pupil Placement Act of the State of Arkansas to determine whether they are entitled to admission to particular schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="6006.671" offset="24130017">But, we don't have that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6008.068" offset="24135659">We don't have a case here where the plaintiffs are seeking admission to any particular school.</text>
            <text syncTime="6015.618" offset="24165857">Now, again, there's a good deal of time spent on referring to the other sanctions that the State Superintendent might impose, and they refer to the withholding of funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="6026.551" offset="24209533">Well, now, the statutory reference to that says that before a state -- before a local school board is entitled to get funds from the State, there must be an affidavit filed stating that no discrimination exists in the school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="6041.385" offset="24268884">Now, there is nothing in the statute that says that if the State Superintendent receives such an affidavit, even though he may know it to be false, that he can withhold funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="6049.891" offset="24302947">He has no discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6050.855" offset="24306813">He is given no discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.001" offset="24311411">Once he gets the affidavit, he must dispense the funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="6055.031" offset="24323532">And to say that it can be assumed that he will withhold these funds is certainly -- was not certain enough in terms of giving the plaintiffs in this case a remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="6271.244" offset="25188394">I referred to the case of Hillsborough Township versus Cromwell in which there was a consideration given to whether a state remedy would have to be exhausted involving taxation.</text>
