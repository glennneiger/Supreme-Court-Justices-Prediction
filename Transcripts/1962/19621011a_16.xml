          <heading>Argument of George B. Christensen</heading>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="28.559">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 16, Shotwell Manufacturing Company, et al., Petitioners, versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.691" offset="210108">Mr. Christensen.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="28.559" stopTime="603.278">
            <label>Mr. George B. Christensen</label>
            <text syncTime="28.559" offset="217631">Mr. Chief Justice, if it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.470" offset="269249">The tragic tale that's unfolded by this record is I think one that with tax your credulity where we not able to document it, so well as we assert we have documented it.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.354" offset="344795">And once it's understood it's a -- not only tragic but it's a dark and frightening tale but for two things, those two things are first, your decision in the Jencks case in 1957 that gave us the tools to work with at least to start the investigation by the production of witness statements and that ultimately led to grand jury testimony that disclosed how this record at least upon the remanded proceeding had been put together.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.112" offset="527862">And that in turn led us to the evidence of the perjury that had been offered against the citizens we represent upon their original jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.010" offset="575404">And of course the second thing that relieves the tragedy of this case that we assert brings a blush of shame to American jurisprudence is the right to apply here for certiorari and fortunately to have obtained it.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.445" offset="673102">Now, the case is complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.889" offset="682924">I fear that you are going to have the greatest of difficulty in following the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.850" offset="718764">Basic to an understanding of it, I think is this, this was a criminal indictment or evasion of a portion of the income taxes of the Shotwell Manufacturing Corporation, a corporation, for the years 1945 and 1946 indictment alleged some $500,000 of gross income or of net income was unreported and that the resulting tax by the time of trial, they claim they had there shown time of trial not $500,000 but approximately $454,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.568" offset="925654">Now that mind you is the year 1953 when the trial took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.426" offset="965047">Now, there's a greatest difference between that figure and something that had occurred years before and which was in large part, subject to Justice Harlan's opinion when we were here the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.421" offset="1033070">Bearing in mind that this alleged evasion is assumed to have occurred in 1945 and 1946 and that the prosecutors delayed until the last day before the statute ran in 1952 before pitching in an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.906" offset="1114990">The fact is that in early 1948 when the Treasury so-called “voluntary disclosure program” was in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.207" offset="1168175">These petitioners went to Ernie Sauber then assistant deputy collector in Chicago and made a voluntary disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.103" offset="1215822">Now, mind you, here is where mentally you have to shift gears and you get in to some of the confusion in which this entire case evolves.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.213" offset="1272247">The Shotwell Company made candy.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.089" offset="1287711">It made a variety of candy that instead of using corn -- instead of using cane sugar, used corn syrup as its principal sweetener.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.359" offset="1340792">And in the year 1945, after the V-E Day, the fact was, and there is no dispute about this, that the Office Price Administration's price ceilings upon corn, raw corn, corn in the bin in the hands of the farmer, became totally out of balance with respect to the price on hogs.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.426" offset="1449044">And it was of course far more profitable then for a farmer instead of selling his corn to feed it and sell his hogs and there came a time in the late fall of 1945 and I speak from the record that any time I depart from the record, I will tell you so.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.302" offset="1552593">When cash corn virtually disappeared from the greatest corn market in the world, the Chicago Board of Trade, the Commodity Credit Corporation either in late 1945 or early 1946, I forget which itself went out on the so-called black or gray market and began paying anywhere from 25 cents to 50 cents a bushel upward for corn.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.814" offset="1670666">Well, what went on, I don't but obviously, the war was over, the period of price controls was about over.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.372" offset="1712880">They were not adjusted until some time in about June 30th, 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.564" offset="1741615">That is near enough when the ceiling upon corn was removed, it became plentiful and after that, there became plenty of corn syrup and on we went in our way.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.182" offset="1784142">Now, during that time, it is our contention that to get cash, it did not show upon Shotwell's books so that we wouldn't be caught by the OPA inspectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.936" offset="1851120">We sold some candy.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.896" offset="1862928">A character by the name of Lubben whom you've met before, not merely in your first go-around with this case but in the Long and Giglio cases arising out of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.055" offset="1915591">We sold candy to him in which he paid in addition to the ceiling invoice price of the candy, a premium per pound.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.331" offset="1964701">A great dispute as to what the amount of that premium was.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.603" offset="1985808">We then took that cash, didn't record it, said nothing about it and we used that in turn to pay elevator operators or so-called “bird dogs”, you would pay them the premium price upon corn and they would sell and then make corn available to corn products refining, Hubinger, Penick and Ford, whoever the corn refiner was.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.882" offset="2086849">They grind the corn and they in turn would sell you corn syrup at ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.483" offset="2113285">Now, this has all been done secretly.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.494" offset="2137318">As the fellow Lubben fell into the greatest of difficulties as he well could with the characters he was associated with that reflected by your record in United States versus Long and Giglio and Justice Brennan knows that experience with Mr. Lubben in New Jersey that led to a disbarment there and a rectification of a distillery swindle he got into later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.352" offset="2240763">He wanted a loan and my corporate client sends its outside auditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.017" offset="2283395">He used to take a look at Lubben's books and to see what shape he was in.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.863" offset="2298859">Should we loan him some money?</text>
            <text syncTime="550.225" offset="2304293">He'd go into the candy business.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.778" offset="2314533">This auditor, a gentleman by the name of Busby, an auditor, a public accountant of unquestioned integrity, went out there and he came back and he saw our clients Harold Sullivan and Byron Cain and he said he's in hopeless shape, don't loan in any money and what's more?</text>
            <text syncTime="572.312" offset="2392586">His books would indicate that he's been paying you some over ceiling premiums back in 1945 and 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.286" offset="2428531">And you never told me anything about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.314" offset="2436577">I made your tax returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.978" offset="2443264">What are you guys been up to?</text>
            <text syncTime="588.057" offset="2455594">And Lubben had with him on this trip, and this becomes crucial, Shotwell's own comptroller or head bookkeeper, a fellow by the name of Graflund.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="603.278" stopTime="604.524">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="603.278" offset="2516511">I thought he was Busby.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_b_christensen" startTime="604.524" stopTime="838.327">
            <label>Mr. George B. Christensen</label>
            <text syncTime="604.524" offset="2521422">I beg your pardon, thank you sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.295" offset="2528528">Busby had with him this gentleman by the name of Graflund.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.779" offset="2542529">And Graflund on this trip, told him yes and as he put it in testifying to United States grand jury, “I didn't spare the horses in telling you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="623.239" offset="2596342">They returned to Chicago on the 11th of January and Busby goes to his clients and says, “What are you been up to?”</text>
            <text syncTime="629.742" offset="2622360">So you're in tax difficulties and this is a fine kettle of fish and they say to one in substance, “Look, we took the money in.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.880" offset="2670843">We spend it for corn, what's the tax problem?”</text>
            <text syncTime="647.426" offset="2693099">He said, “The tax problem is this, that under Treasury regulations, what you acquire or receive is premium payments, is gross income that you must account for.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.176" offset="2760077">What you may have spent over ceiling for raw material cannot be taken as part of the cost of goods or any other, for our purposes, let's say, deductible item.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.530" offset="2809501">You are going to be taxed upon the gross amount.”</text>
            <text syncTime="680.480" offset="2825279">He then told them about the voluntary disclosure program.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.724" offset="2842311">Busby is not a lawyer and he had never made a voluntary disclosure although he knew about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.696" offset="2866134">And the essence of the voluntary disclosure program and you will find at the back end of both our petition for certiorari in our main brief, the official statements of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.318" offset="2908662">It never came out in a regulation but pronouncements from the Secretary of Treasury as the general counsel of the Treasury and they were in substance, you've got something wrong with your tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.154" offset="2959966">Come in and tell us about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.341" offset="2968743">You'll be taxed, you may get civil penalties but there will be no criminal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.116" offset="2987865">This is the way to avoid going to jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.494" offset="3001344">It was part of a concerted right during those years to get in money, tax money, resulting from precisely transactions of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.122" offset="3043871">It was feared that much of it would escape taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.041" offset="3059545">They said, Busby find out how to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.756" offset="3074382">Busby went to Sauber, he talked with him without disclosing the name of his client, simply finding out what to do and putting it up as a hypothetical case.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.521" offset="3125478">And then he went on and reported to his clients, “Yes, we can do it, it will be all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.146" offset="3147943">All right, go in and disclose and tell them who we are.”</text>
            <text syncTime="765.561" offset="3165602">And that was done.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.520" offset="3173439">Now, I'm not trying to be precise on dates.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.873" offset="3182843">I will get to that and that was part of the controversy when we were here before.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.185" offset="3224116">They said, “We don't know what we did with this money.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.273" offset="3232475">We can't prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.238" offset="3236342">We didn't want to know too much about these people, it was dirty business.”</text>
            <text syncTime="788.004" offset="3255359">And the deputy collector said, “As Treasury regulations at that time 1948 required, you will get no credit for a dime that you spend over ceiling no matter how you documented or proved it.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.963" offset="3331218">It makes no difference whether you know what you did with this money or who you paid it to you aren't going to be able to take it as a deduction or an offset or as a part of your cost to goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.622" offset="3381896">Don't bother to file an amended return, you apparently haven't got accurate records, assemble such information as you can, from memory, from notes, from what you can gather here, there and the other places, an agent will be out to investigate and turn it over to him.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2513.772" offset="10158477">I address myself with respect to Harold Sullivan on two points as to the merits of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.224" offset="10188257">Our subsection 5 of the general brief has captured that Sullivan did not have a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.726" offset="10214275">Suppression question has basically been treated by Mr. Christensen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.343" offset="10232769">My point on the suppression issue is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.034" offset="10243532">You did not want to reach the question of whether these documents were constitutionally inhibited until you got to the question of whether the documents came in as a part of a disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.885" offset="10290866">It went back down to Judge Nordbye and Judge Nordbye said, “Yes, these documents came in as a part of the disclosure and indeed they say it was used in the disclosure recap.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.091" offset="10339767">It's what he found but he said, “I'm not satisfied with the truth of it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.143" offset="10363904">But of course in Rogers versus Richmond, you decided that truth or falsity does not decide the question of constitutional permissive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.909" offset="10402983">But that's another question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.015" offset="10411447">They think constitutionally, these documents cannot be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.976" offset="10431300">That's in the other portion of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.001" offset="10439346">But with respect to Harold Sullivan, the only truth about Harold Sullivan, the trial is exceedingly limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.940" offset="10479156">This was a trial four defendants that lasted several weeks with 75 witnesses but when it was over, Judge Nordbye asked -- he reserved the question of the motion of acquittal for Sullivan and he pondered that six weeks after the jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.200" offset="10548224">He asked for briefs and he only asked for small portions of the testimony of two witnesses to be written up out of the 75.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.830" offset="10586676">And the only testimony that runs through Judge Nordbye's whole opinion denying the acquittal of Sullivan is that this man Lubben said that he had gone to Sullivan's office on February 14, 1946 and he tendered some checks and Sullivan said, “I don't want checks, we want cash.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.245" offset="10680404">And as Lubben so testified, he produced check forms dated February 14, 1946 but with the names of the payees' cut out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.585" offset="10725752">That's to prove his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.964" offset="10735261">Now, that's all there is about Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.269" offset="10744456">Accordingly, when you go to Judge Nordbye's careful written opinion, that's all there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.782" offset="10766503">Now, I point out that the next morning, Lubben took the stand and referring to divine guidance recanted, said he wasn't there in February, it was in the fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.624" offset="10821883">Well, in the fall?</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.635" offset="10825958">He could have been there about February 14 checks and this poisonous point, “he didn't want checks, he want cash” couldn't have occurred in the fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.407" offset="10865037">Now, this Court, therefore have this to Sullivan an instance where the whole case as to Sullivan is upon an alleged extrajudicial admission uncorroborated therefore the corpus delicti cannot be established with the U.S. versus Smith and U.S. versus Collin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.170" offset="10952077">But not only is this an extrajudicial admission which is uncorroborated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.950" offset="10979140">It's recanted the very next morning and I say with all respect that as you said that verdict must stand or fall on the evidence that was in then, as to Sullivan, it must fall.</text>

            <text syncTime="2734.420" offset="11041102">I wasn't clear whether the recanting related to the date of the conversation or to the existence of any conversation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2743.521" offset="11077465">The mechanics of the recanting were, he said, I had “a conversation” in the fall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.763" offset="11114454">He never gave the context or the text of it so I say that it's a recantation in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.480" offset="11145279">At least it is no corroborated extrajudicial admission of that substance that is needed to supply that one thing to hold Mr. Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.178" offset="11200136">Now, at the very least, further, and as an additional point with respect to Sullivan, this case presented a problem which is often occupied the attention of this in other courts where you have a number of man in a long complicated trial in evidences admissible against some but not others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.360" offset="11292818">And then the question is, has the one against to whom the evidence was not admitted can protect so that his faith is not decided by evidence which is not admitted or admissible against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.753" offset="11366379">Judges Learned Hand and Jerome Frank and a number of the justices of this Court have taken the view that where the evidence is vital and dramatic, it is impossible for the jury to perform the mental gymnastics of just simply striking it from their mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.409" offset="11440985">And some fine opinions have been written where it is said that where you have that vital evidence, it just will be transferred inevitably.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.818" offset="11490617">But in any event, this Court has in two cases where the Court gave very strong restrictive instruction that the evidence should not be transferred over to the person against whom that was not admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.846" offset="11566791">In two cases, this Court is permitted the conviction to stand, those being Blumenthal and Delli Paoli.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.847" offset="11594794">That even in Delli Paoli, there was a very strong dissent by Justice Frankfurter for himself and Justices Black, Douglas and Brennan which said that psychologically it was impossible for the jury not to consider that strong dramatic evidence against the other petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.988" offset="11679326">Now, in this case involved and in two cases where the judge didn't make that impregnable barrier, convictions were reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.200" offset="11712136">Those two being Anderson and Kotteakos.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.867" offset="11730840">Now, in this case, most of the evidence was never admitted, much of it was never even offered against Sullivan but when it came time to instruct the jury, the judge affirmatively directed them to consider that evidence against Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.722" offset="11810252">There was an affirmative misdirection not a mere equivocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.337" offset="11828746">For instance, Lubben testified about many conversations out of the presence of Sullivan and Cain and they were highly dramatic with money piled up by motel beds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.847" offset="11870751">They were not admitted against Sullivan but in the instructions, the jury was told to consider them against Sullivan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.330" offset="11900740">The claimed oral admissions of Cain where he was asked many, many questions about how he made up some figures, they were not offered against Sullivan, they were not admitted against Sullivan but in the charge of the jury, the judge very vividly recall them and told the jury to consider them against Sullivan.</text>

            <text syncTime="3177.203" offset="12812204">The jury found these defendants guilty after six weeks trial with very lengthy evidence about 3,000 pages of the transcript printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.239" offset="12872286">Judge Nordbye found that the voluntary disclosure, the alleged voluntary disclosure was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.321" offset="12920665">He found that after two lengthy hearings, one before the trial and the other one after this Court had remanded the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.551" offset="12973537">He found that the unrecorded receipts which had been disclosed by the voluntary disclosure had not been spent for raw materials as had been claimed in the alleged voluntary disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.944" offset="13059114">Judge Nordbye also found that there was an attempt to fix this case by some sort of mechanisms within the revenue service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.114" offset="13127868">I like to give just a brief summary of the facts to support those two findings of the jury and of the -- of Judge Nordbye.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.183" offset="13176142">At the trial, the evidence showed that corporation through its officers had received $400,000 in black market receipts during the years 1945 and 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.580" offset="13261720">And that those receipts had not been reported on the returns.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.116" offset="13287842">There's plenty of evidence of this, direct evidence not only from Lubben of his payments but also from others who had made payments for Lubben.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.258" offset="13344371">And there was a wealth of documentary evidence to support that to corroborate the testimony that Lubben gave as to this approximately $400,000 in payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.041" offset="13407587">The defense was that the taxpayers had received that is that the corporation had received only $150,000 and the defense further claimed and put on evidence to support it that they had spent all of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.001" offset="13507375">The evidence was not different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.179" offset="13516048">There was no evidence of any specific payment at all it was very general.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.290" offset="13548544">The issues that went to the jury then were how much did the corporation get in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.825" offset="13578637">Did it get $400,000 or did it get $150,000?</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.615" offset="13609880">And the second issue was where did it go?</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.454" offset="13625240">Did it go in payments for raw material as the defendants claim or did it go someplace else?</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.156" offset="13667976">There was a sharp conflict in the evidence on this, the evidence on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.687" offset="13702144">It was purely a question of credibility which group of witnesses was the jury going to believe or the jury believed the Government's witnesses and convicted the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.024" offset="13771421">On the voluntary disclosure, the evidence at those hearings showed that sometime early in 1948, the defendants began worrying about these 1945 and 1946 returns.</text>

            <text syncTime="3496.888" offset="14090951">They began to worry about this early in 1948 and the reason for that was that Lubben was beginning to have tax troubles himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.334" offset="14140688">Lubben's tax troubles dated back as far as 1945 or certainly in February 1946 when he filed his income tax return and included only a partial payment and gave certain reasons why he had not paid the full thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.816" offset="14242670">The Treasury began to investigate him at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.690" offset="14258134">And as Judge Nordbye found in his opinion, Shotwell, people knew that when Lubben began having tax troubles, their day of reckoning was not far away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.017" offset="14319470">Consequently, some time before June 21, 1946 -- 1948 Busby and Cain went in to see Mr. Sauber who was at that time a high official in the Chicago Office of the Revenue Service and this is Judge Nordbye's finding on the -- after the supplemental hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.543" offset="14429497">Sauber told them to make a complete computation of the receipts and the disbursements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.672" offset="14474010">Now, the other side has challenged our statement that he wanted -- that Sauber told them to make a computation of both receipts and expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.872" offset="14526882">But that is the testimony of Sauber at the original suppression hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.573" offset="14557706">It's the testimony of Busby at the trial and it's the testimony of Graflund who quotes Cain at length and saying that this is what Sauber told them to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.952" offset="14623222">The testimony of Graflund at the suppression hearing or at the supplemental hearing after the case went back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.818" offset="14666689">On June the 21st, Agent Sam Krane arrived on an errand asking for records of the corporations dealings with Lubben.</text>

            <text syncTime="3737.658" offset="15054033">All of that proof was put before him and he made his finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.241" offset="15084335">After -- immediately after Krane's visit on June the 21st, there were a number of frantic conferences among the defendants as to what should be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.155" offset="15135953">And at that time as Judge Nordbye found, they first began to exert themselves to collect the figures on the attempted voluntary disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.231" offset="15204289">Very shortly after also, Cain with a New York attorney by the name of Grace at a meeting with Lubben and his attorney whose name was Davidson in a night club outside of New York, the Riviera Club.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.504" offset="15297390">And Cain told Lubben and Davidson that he was attempting to settle a case by political contacts and he mentioned a member of the Cabinet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.885" offset="15366875">And I might say that the investigation that has been made as shown no connection of that member of the Cabinet with this case whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3826.997" offset="15411388">There's other evidence in the record that Cain was a notorious name-dropper and that he was likely to say that he had gone all the way to the top.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.663" offset="15466036">So I want to make it clear that although that name is in there, nothing has been shown to connect him with in any way at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.664" offset="15501981">At any rate, Cain said, he was trying to settle it in this manner and he urged Lubben to go to South America and stay there for two years to keep out of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.862" offset="15562794">Grace said that he was going to pay a visit to the office of Dan Bolich who was the Internal Revenue agent in charge in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.842" offset="15614725">He was in charge of the fraud cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.319" offset="15628622">And this Court knows of Mr. Bolich through the Grunewald case where he appears very prominently and in fact, he was a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.768" offset="15682435">After the meetings in New York, Cain called the various interested members or officers of the corporation together in the Belden-Stratford Hotel in Chicago in order to work out the figures which were to be submitted to the Revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3923.285" offset="15796537">Those figures showed receipts of $400,000 and they also showed expenditures of $400,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3936.414" offset="15848991">I'm using it in a very approximate term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.020" offset="15867486">Cain admitted that those expenditure figures were merely plug figures and there is considerable evidence in the record that the officers of the corporation tried to work out the expenditures and the most they could come to is about $125,000 or $150,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3965.533" offset="15965497">And Cain said, “Sauber told us we had to have this in here and we've got to make the figures matched”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.804" offset="15998621">He said, “Give me a piece of paper and I'll work it out.”</text>
