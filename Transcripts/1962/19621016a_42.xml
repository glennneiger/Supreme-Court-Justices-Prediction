            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="37.311" offset="252635">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.680" offset="266115">This is a civil antitrust case, here on direct appeal to the District Court for the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.070" offset="295685">It presents issues relating to the legality under Section 1 of the Sherman Act of the block booking of feature motion pictures for television exhibition and also questions relating to appropriate relief to deal with that practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.417" offset="373008">Block booking is defined as the practice by the distributors of motion pictures of requiring television stations in order to license certain pictures, generally the pictures which they desire to also accept other pictures generally pictures which they did not desire.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.130" offset="455868">And the phrase "block booking" refers to the fact that when these pictures are offered, they are generally offered in blocks of packages of varying numbers, 50, 60, or 100 and 200.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.559" offset="509576">And the issue as presented arises from the fact as the District Court found that these defendants in offering the pictures had on numerous occasions refused to permit the stations to select among the packages and had required them to take the entire package.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.483" offset="589302">There are six defendants in the case, each of whom is a distributor of feature motion pictures for television.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.237" offset="624306">This particular case involves features known as pre-1948 features.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.766" offset="646457">Those are old motion pictures that were distributed and shown in theaters prior to 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.390" offset="676968">The District Court held that each defendant had violated the Sherman Act by block booking and granted injunctive relief and both sides of appeal to this Court, the Government as well as five of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.768" offset="734438">Now, I might just say in passing that of course all of these motion pictures involved are copyrighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.574" offset="761710">The issues in the case fall into two distinct categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.921" offset="779055">There are questions relating to the substantive issues and questions relating to the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.004" offset="803401">The substantive issues tended by the defendants in their appeal of substantive issue was this, the defendants do not challenge the findings of the District Court that they had entered into block book contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.173" offset="868080">They do, however, challenge the Court's finding that these block book contracts were illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.484" offset="897337">The Government's appeal challenges the District Court's failure to find that a block contract arising out of another set of circumstances that I shall detail in my opinion was not illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.564" offset="949582">Now, on the relief issues, the defendant's appeal argues that no relief at all should have been granted against the violations which the District Court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.536" offset="993468">Conversely, the Government's appeal argues that additional relief was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.552" offset="1017605">And in my oral argument, I shall discuss the points in that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.998" offset="1031398">First, I shall discuss the question of violation, and second, the question of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.649" offset="1053968">But before coming to my argument at the outset, I would like to correct four errors which the defendants have pointed out that we have most regretfully made in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.017" offset="1111437">This is the brief, the United States in reply to appellant's brief in Numbers 43 and Number 44.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.495" offset="1137351">It's an intermediate-sized brief of 20 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.971" offset="1159293">The first error is at page 8 about one-third of the way down in the first not full paragraph, the last sentence beginning finally one of Loew's own sales reports discloses that in September 1957, that date should be 1956.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.969" offset="1643290">Now, coming to the facts of the case, the Government in 1957 filed six separate cases against the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.795" offset="1682578">Each case alleged that the particular defendant had engaged in illegal block booking.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.003" offset="1703372">And I want to make it clear in these cases, there's no charge of any conspiracy or concerted action against all the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.495" offset="1733360">Each case was a separate case against each defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.049" offset="1747571">Although as I shall develop in my argument, we think the record shows that there was a common pattern, a common method by which films were distributed to the industry, that is the practice of conditioning them and selling them in blocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.313" offset="1800652">Now in 1956, early in 1956, there had been no substantial distribution yet of these old movies to television, and the motion picture companies, which had large libraries of films, included that they had a very valuable asset which they wish to realize on.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.633" offset="1873899">And they undertook beginning in 1956 to distribute these old movies to television.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.573" offset="1897618">They did it in various ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.231" offset="1904306">Some of the motion picture companies themselves distributed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.013" offset="1919457">In other instances, some of the defendants acquired the right to license these pictures to television from the motion picture companies by substantial cash payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.801" offset="1962611">The method by which they distributed it varied.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.621" offset="1973896">For example, Loew's in the first instance attempted to sell its entire library of 723 films.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.759" offset="2002422">Other defendants distributed the pictures in smaller packages.One of them distributed 13 packages of 58 pictures each.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.399" offset="2032933">But in the course of this distribution, two things, we think, stand out.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.199" offset="2060204">The first is that all of them undertook to distribute their films in packages that with one exception, none of them priced the films individually.</text>

            <text syncTime="650.751" offset="2706369">As to five of the defendants, the District Court found that specific contracts entered into by each defendant were illegally block booked.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.690" offset="2758092">I'll come to those in a moment but I'd like to just in passing, refer to the sixth defendant a corporation known as the C &amp; C Super Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.103" offset="2795813">Without going into the facts in detail, this company followed a somewhat different practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.469" offset="2825279">Because in order to finance the films which it had purchased from RKO, it found it necessary to enter into an agreement with the International Latex Corporation under which the International Latex Corporation made available to C &amp; C certain payments which C &amp; C and their current venues to pay off the cost of its film line.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.412" offset="2925066">And the condition for International Latex making these payments available to C &amp; C was that C &amp; C in turn would procure certain television time for International Latex.</text>

            <text syncTime="730.698" offset="3026213">And the District Court held that with respect to this company that the result of this agreement was to force it to operate under a policy of block booking.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.779" offset="3062471">And the Court found it was unnecessary to find any where the particular contracts for block book as the Court held in effect, all of those contracts had to be block booked.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.409" offset="3101027">In other words, they were unable because of their financing arrangements to enter into anything less than a contract covering a substantial number of pictures.</text>

            <text syncTime="841.620" offset="3469876">Now, the record in this case contains extensive testimony by many representatives of television stations called by the Government that they purchased films which they did not want.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.301" offset="3528600">And in some instances films which they did not use because this was the only way they could get the desirable films in the package.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.159" offset="3564022">Now, I would like to just give the Court two examples relating to the negotiations of contracts which the District Court specifically found had been block booked.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.074" offset="3607698">The first one involves a contract which Loew's made with a station in March of 1958 for the entire library of 723 films that Loew's offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.157" offset="3664018">The station representative testified they only wanted to take 500 because as they said, "We felt that these approximately 200 films, 200 leftover were a group of films that we would never use on the station at all."</text>
            <text syncTime="904.786" offset="3722533">But he replied that the Loew's representative made it very clear that we either bought the whole package and that we could not call from it take anything out of it, and that was it, so we renegotiated for the whole package.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.136" offset="3775927">This material is at the record 709 -- 907, 908, and 909, 915, and 916, it is set forth in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.879" offset="3810931">Now, at the time this witness testified at the trial in March of 1960, approximately two years after this contract had been entered into, they stated that they had not yet run these 200 pictures, that they had no plan to run them at that time, and the reason they were not planning to run them was they said was, "Because there are so many pictures in the group that we feel do not come up to the standard of the operation of our station and the programming that we want to give the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.982" offset="3919287">That's one example the contract found block book where the station was required to take 200 films which it not only didn't want, but was unable to show.</text>

            <text syncTime="985.030" offset="4043525">Now, the second example involved the defendant's C &amp; C Corporation which is I indicated followed on how it had this policy of block booking.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.529" offset="4077484">And among the films included in the RKO Library which were part of the package wasn't foreign language pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.253" offset="4108413">These stations were also required to take and the owner or operator of a station in Huntington, West Virginia explained that he didn't have much of the market for foreign language pictures in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.173" offset="4156061">Now, what the record we think shows in this case is something rather unusual in a tying case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.636" offset="4189915">We have in this record affirmative testimony, testimony of the station owners which establishes the very vice which this Court has repeatedly adverted to in condemning tying agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.479" offset="4245295">That is the fact that the necessary result of a tying agreement is to force the buyer to take something he doesn't want, and that's precisely what this record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.153" offset="4292002">Television stations were forced as a result of these block book contracts to take films they didn't want.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.494" offset="4321364">And in addition to that, the Court has also pointed in the tying agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.416" offset="4337037">The inevitable effect of these agreements is to foreclose competing sellers at the tied product from having access to that segment of the market and similarly here, we think, it's quite clear that in the hypothetical case I gave a moment ago involving Loew's, when they were forced to take the 200 pictures they didn't want, a competing seller of these poor motion pictures though they may be was excluded from that segment of the market covered by the tied contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.370" offset="7152828">The practice is as follows; a distributor comes into a television station, says, "Well, we have a package.</text>

            <text syncTime="1772.475" offset="7193266">The station owner looks and says, "Well, I'd like to take some of these films.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.942" offset="7207163">These are very fine and I don't want some others", well as they say, "Break the package.</text>

            <text syncTime="1782.099" offset="7231718">The individual distributor says, "No.</text>

            <text syncTime="1788.525" offset="7257422">We're going to go around and see if we can sell you -- sell the entire package to one of your competitive stations in the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="1801.264" offset="7308413">At this point, the station then says, "Well, rather than run the risk of Loew's in them all, we'll enter into a package.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.845" offset="7334745">And they entered into a package deal for the entire group of pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.763" offset="7354389">The District Court held that this practice was not an illegal tie-in contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.203" offset="7380198">The District Court held that a defendant as he quoted, "a distributor has the right to test out the market to see whether he can sell a part of the package," the whole package before undertaking negotiations for a part, and therefore he said, "Such a contract was not illegally block booked."</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.431" offset="7449057">We think this was wrong and we think this is wrong basically for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.601" offset="7465775">First, the fundamental vise of the block book tie-in contract forcing the stations to take some pictures in order to get others is equally present whether the refusal to deal is for an interim period, pending an attempt to sell the package elsewhere or whether it is in terms a complete refusal to deal and absolutely within both instances, if the station enters into a tied contract, it is in those circumstances it is required to take pictures that it doesn't want as a condition to getting other pictures.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.849" offset="7846745">When the Court rose, I was discussing the question of the so-called interim refusal to deal except on a block book basis and I attempted to point out that in terms of the effectiveness on these television stations, the effect is the same whether they purchased the complete package including films that they don't want because in the first instance, they're offered only the complete package or in the second instance, they told that they cannot select individually unless and until the station offers the entire package to the competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.748" offset="7994389">Now, I think in a realistic sense, this distinction between the temporary refusal to deal and the permanent refusal to deal really doesn't amount to very much because I think fairly it can be said that when a distributor comes to a particular television station say in the Washington market and says, "Here is a package", and the station says, "Can I have less than the package?"</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.892" offset="8094908">and the station says, "No, you have to take the whole package."</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.731" offset="8114343">Implicit in this, of course, is a notion that they're going to try to sell the package as a package elsewhere in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.180" offset="8144123">And if everyone of the stations in the Washington area refused to buy the package, it seems likely that the next step they're going to do is to then come back and attempt to sell as much of it as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.907" offset="8195009">So that we think in the situation where they say, no, we're not going to negotiate with you for individual pictures until we've had an opportunity to sell them elsewhere in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.001" offset="8247359">This is really making explicit, what we think is implicit in every situation where there's an absolute refusal to sell less than the entire package pending an attempt to sell the entire package to the entire market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.170" offset="8308067">And we think that both of these situations are equally illegal that it's not a question -- it's testing the market in both situations because when the distributor who refuses at all to negotiate for less than a package does so he again is testing the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.271" offset="8392495">He's trying to see if he can't sell it to the first station to sell it to one of the other stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.494" offset="8413393">And when it's done, said, we're only going to do this temporarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.562" offset="8425618">This is basically the same thing and we think that in any realistic sense, these two types of contract, these block contracts, are basically separate from the same vice in each instance, there is the illegal tie-in and we think that they are both illegal, and we think in these circumstances the District Court should have held that this type of situation is also illegal and should have enjoined its use.</text>

            <text syncTime="2482.967" offset="10035284">The District Court upon finding that each defendant had violated the Act concluded record 47 and an injunction should of course be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.155" offset="10076035">The Court further stated that the necessity for such an injunction flows from the facts of this case and the present state of licensing of feature films to the television industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.025" offset="10119502">We think the District Court was clearly correct in deciding that injunctive relief should be granted against these violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.701" offset="10158164">The Court found that each defendant had violated the Act while the telephone number of contracts found who have been block booked was not large admittedly in relation to the total number of these parties contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.600" offset="10205811">They never list words of substantial number.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.871" offset="10214902">It involved a substantial segment of commerce, and it's well settled, I won't burden the Court with the rule that upon a finding of violation of the antitrust laws, the District Court has the duty to enter an appropriate relief that will cure the violations and protect the public against their recurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.666" offset="10302046">I won't attempt to take up the arguments of each of the individual defendants as to the particular violations found and particular evidence showing the continuation of these practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.662" offset="10353977">I just point out one thing, the case of the defendant Loew's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.371" offset="10372890">Defendant Loew's is the only one of these defendants, which in 1957, made a public announcement to the trade that it would then support licensed pictures individually any number from one to 723.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.803" offset="10442585">No other defendant publicized any such notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.126" offset="10455855">But and we think this is most significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.542" offset="10465573">The two contracts of Loew's which the defendant found were block booked were made in 1958 approximately a year after this policy have been announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.526" offset="10517504">So we think the District Court was clearly correct and certainly cannot be said to abuse its discretion in entering an injunction and I now like to turn to the terms of the Court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.515" offset="10569435">The Court entered substantially identical judgments as to all of the defendants and we have used for less than the purpose of the judgment in the first case, the Loew's case at pages 52 to 53 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.305" offset="10624606">And the critical portions of the judgment are in paragraphs IV and V.</text>

            <text syncTime="2654.386" offset="10720946">At 52 and 53 of Volume 1 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.865" offset="10742784">The judgment provisions in paragraph IV (a) enjoins the defendant from conditioning or tying or attempting to condition or tie the purchase of any film upon the purchase or license of any other film, that's in (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.985" offset="10807359">(b), substantial repeats that but it's in terms of conditioning the acceptance of a film for showing over one station upon taking the film for showing in other stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.676" offset="10858036">And (c) prohibits entering into any agreement to sell a license of any feature film in which the differential between the price of the film when sold individually and when sold as part of a package has the effect of conditioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.087" offset="10919685">That is if they say, "Well, here are these pictures and individually they're priced at A, B, C, $1000, $2,000, $2,500 but if you take them all in a package, the price is so much."</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.631" offset="10973915">The Court prohibits a differential between the price of the picture when sold individually and when sold as part of the package which has the effect conditioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.781" offset="11014457">Now, I'd like to explain to the Court why we think these two provisions are not adequate to terminate the block booking which has existed in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.863" offset="11074853">The record in this case shows that all of the defendants attempted to sell their pictures in packages that one exception they did not quote individual prices that no salesman had authority to close a deal for individual films.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.477" offset="11157295">They could close the package but if individual pictures were sold, he had to communicate with the home office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.685" offset="11186134">And of course, in this situation, station owner who was offered a package was a seller who then testified was aware that the package during these negotiations might be sold to a rival station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.951" offset="11243186">But in addition to that and we think this is very significant, six or seven different station representatives testified when they were asked whether or why they had not requested distributors to sell less than the whole package, they said, "Well, we were conditioned to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.148" offset="11316015">This was the way business was done in this industry."</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.840" offset="11330748">As one station representative put it at page 388 of the record, "We have been conditioned in this business for years now to think in terms of conditions of packages."</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.725" offset="11374320">And another one stated at record 736, "It was the way the industry was buying, and anytime they came in with a package, you knew it was a package and you just understood it" so that what you have in this industry is a history of selling pictures on a package basis, difficulties experience by stations in getting individual pictures, violations found by the Court of a number of contracts that were tied, and a recognition on the part of the people who were the buyers, that this was the way pictures were being distributed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.751" offset="13014392">A station in Baltimore, we've cited in our brief, was quoted a price of $61,000 for the 10 Selznick's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.333" offset="13044694">And after that, it purchased a package of 46 including the 10 Selznick's for $62,000.In other words, it was being priced to the basis of buying the additional 36 films for $1,000 or roughly $25 to $30 a film as against the price of $6,000 for each of the Selznick.</text>

            <text syncTime="3278.103" offset="13215744">Now, there's another example which I think graphically indicates the danger of this and how this can be used to illegally condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.432" offset="13253151">Loew's, there's an exhibit in the record, Exhibit 20, Loew's Exhibit 20 which is a long memorandum that Loew's put out to its salesmen at the time it announced this new practice in 1957 in April that it would sell pictures individually and it listed, instructed there was to be no conditioning, pictures would be sold individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.491" offset="13345311">And they priced the pictures individually and of course, we don't say each picture has to be priced with a dollar and cents amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.572" offset="13373628">You don't have to say, "This picture is $230.40."</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.008" offset="13387421">The station is perfectly free to lump a group of pictures together so these pictures are all category B1, the price is $250 a piece, take as many as you want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.573" offset="13429635">And after the pricing have been set up and the announcement of the policy, Loew's had included with a schedule of discounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.358" offset="13460773">I think these are very revealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.810" offset="13470595">They announced that if the station took a package of 100 films selected by Loew's, not the station's choice, but selected by Loew's, then in that event there'd be a 25% discount from the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.374" offset="13524825">If they selected one-half of the Loew's Library of 723 films as selected by Loew's, in that event, 37.5% discount.</text>

            <text syncTime="3451.649" offset="13909974">The defendants, both as appellants and respondents have divided their time for argument so that one of my colleagues will reply to the Government's appeal position that the decree should be enlarged including the temporary -- so-called temporary block booking provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.934" offset="13987088">Another of my colleagues will address himself to the proposition that there were a minimal, minuscule number of alleged violations found not warranting the sweeping injunction decree which is here in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.185" offset="14048110">A third colleague will address himself to the unique position of C &amp; C which followed a practice quite different and which it sold time spots rather than for pictures for money.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.246" offset="14096384">And I will limit myself to the proposition that as a matter of law, there was no basis for the finding of an illegal tie-in in the limited number, a few number of cases which the District Court found to exist and that the complaints of the Government should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.556" offset="14169631">The Government filed six separate suits against six distributors of motion picture films.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.330" offset="14200665">And each of them, it conceded that there was no issue of monopoly, no combination, and no conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.003" offset="14239431">These six suits were over the process of the defendants that they were being combined although their practices were different for reasons of convenience of trial consolidated by the Court and tried together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.858" offset="14298781">It was the Government's claim in each of these six separate actions although Your Honors should observe that there are 115 distributors of feature films to television which is a new industry and not analogous at all with the motion picture case, Paramount case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.992" offset="14375372">The Government contended at all times that 100% of all contracts were block booked, illegal tie-ins.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.422" offset="14417063">Contended at all times that it was the policy of each company to tie-in and block book every contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.894" offset="14442977">This was its position through three years of most exhausting and exhausted trial procedures, 21,000 documents were called from the files of the television stations and thousands of others onto the ages of the FBI were taken from our files.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.359" offset="14512776">There were 13 pretrial conferences with the Court, hundreds of pages of answers to interrogatories, and at the dates of the trial for the first time, the Government withdrew from its position that there was a policy to block book or that every contract was block booked, and dozens of witnesses who had been subpoenaed for the trial were interviewed by the Government and not put upon stand, and other witnesses took the stand, and testified about matters and never were asked about the very contract which was alleged to have been block booked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.843" offset="14658748">And after 36 days of trial, the Court found that out of 202 Loew contracts in total, made in this new industry, two were allegedly illegal for tie-ins by subordinates in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.972" offset="14747251">Out of 221 AAP contracts, four were illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.739" offset="14774314">Out of 411 United Artists contracts, three were illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.705" offset="14798242">And out of 1,500 Screen Gems contracts, two were illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.375" offset="14828857">And this, despite the advantage which the Government had and that these television station executives are sensitive to Government's subpoena, they're under the issues of Government license and supervision and the Court in its opinion even commented upon the fact that these witnesses had an ulterior motive of possibly founding a trouble damage suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.524" offset="14913494">And in the footnote, the Court said that one witness have testified, "If there's going to be a gravy train, I want to get on it."</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.968" offset="14943274">Despite all these, we find, the Government now took into mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.418" offset="14961037">They are separate cases in order to give some impact of the number, 16 or as the Government says 17, I think that was inadvertent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.802" offset="14986533">There are 16 alleged tie-in cases of these thousands of contracts which have been made.</text>

            <text syncTime="3747.658" offset="15094053">Under the authorities, what prerequisite must exist for the finding of an illegal tie-in?</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.173" offset="15128116">The crucial test and we accept those authorities as sound law, we do not quarrel with them, a very beneficent law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.886" offset="15158941">The crucial test is whether the seller has the dominance in the market, equivalent to sufficient economic power to coerce the buyer into taking a subdominant product and thus foreclosing competition for the subdominant product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.457" offset="15241174">It is a very evil practice and that it delimits competition in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.982" offset="15263326">But this prerequisite among others but particularly this one that there must be a demonstration of sufficient economic power to create coercion is the test in all of the authorities handed down by this Court and indeed the Government in its complaint in this action defines block booking as compulsory sale, not sale, compulsory sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.393" offset="15356949">Now, the Northern Pacific case, the latest authority of this Court, the majority and minority agreed that this was the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.346" offset="15396760">The difference of opinion was simply whether the evidence in that case showed sufficient economic power to constitute compulsive --</text>

            <text syncTime="3841.512" offset="15469380">I think you can have, Mr. Justice Douglas, you can have and according to our humble view, you can have economic power in the marketplace without a copyrighted article and you can have none with a copyrighted or patented article and the test is economic power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.122" offset="15539911">And the reason that the block booking case in the Paramount case was sound was that there the copyrighted articles due to the nature of that industry created the complete economic dominance over the industry, 70% of the suppliers of the film that was found by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.670" offset="15602082">Eight companies controlling 78% control the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.549" offset="15617546">And that film constituted 100% of the entertainment in those theaters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.217" offset="15636250">There was no interchangeable product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.620" offset="15645863">And the life of that theater depended upon that particular motion picture and by combining block booking with blind buying in that industry, not applicable at all to this as I shall soon demonstrate by the practices here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.251" offset="15708348">By combining block booking in which 50 odd pictures were sold before they were made, before anyone knew who the stars would be in them with blind buying so that the exhibitor, the theatre owner had to buy them before he could look at them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.131" offset="15767907">They were arrested from the theater operator the power over his own theater and there was clear dominance and the block booking decision in that case was therefore sound.</text>

            <text syncTime="3978.166" offset="16016071">And even though there is a patented article as in the cellophane case, if there are competitive, flexible wrappings, this Court has held that there isn't such an economic power in the market as to constitute the coercion which is the evil in forcing a man to buy that which he doesn't want to buy it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.772" offset="16086497">All of which is lacking in this case and may I cut right through and say to Your Honors that the remarkable fact about this case is that the District Court found there was no dominance of these defendants of motion picture film sales to the distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.614" offset="16157863">He found the crucial test in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.773" offset="16174477">Now, how then if the crucial test was found in our favor, how do we go about finding these few miniscule number of violations?</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.580" offset="16209690">He did so because he deemed himself compelled by the block booking Paramount case to say that the very copyright of a motion picture creates its own dominance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.569" offset="16261622">And the error, we submit, in that reasoning is that the test is not the dominance over the article or indeed you don't need a copyright.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.071" offset="16299656">Everyone has a complete exclusive ownership over any product he makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.190" offset="16316165">The test is the dominance or sufficient economic power over the market in which that article competes with other articles for it is that power over the market which makes it possible to tie-in to compel the buyer to give up his independent judgment and buy a product he doesn't want to buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.132" offset="16387950">Otherwise, the seller is merely improvident in his own strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.579" offset="16405713">He puts down demands because the price is too great.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.426" offset="16421073">The buyer defies him and goes to his competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.526" offset="16433507">He destroys himself by making it unreasonable demand whether it'd be a tie-in demand and limitation of territory, a tie-in provision in the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.042" offset="16475512">He must meet the market conditions or he loses out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4096.527" offset="16489514">And it is only when he has the economic dominance over the market, not over the product, that he has the power to do that which is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.322" offset="16528697">In other words, a benign tie-in becomes evil when it is combined with the economic dominance or sufficient economic power to control the market and thus create the coercion which is the base of the evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.895" offset="16590973">Now, the authorities clearly hold that to be the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.923" offset="16627022">In the Northern Pacific case this Court and referring to the patent made this pertinent observation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.849" offset="16662758">The defendant attempts to evade the force of International Salt on the ground that the tying product there was patented, while here it is not, that's in the Northern Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.774" offset="16702464">But we do not believe this distinction has or should have any significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.317" offset="16720645">And arriving in its decision in International Salt, the Court placed no reliance on the fact that a patent was involved, nor that it give the slightest intimation that the custom of the outcome would have been any different if it had -- if it had not been the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4217.525" offset="16973511">In the Times-Picayune case in view of Mr. Justice White's observation, there, Mr. Justice Clark in his opinion held that because the product was the same, namely advertising into theatres, there was missing that the other ingredient, a different product.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.755" offset="17046444">In other words, the subdominant product wasn't available and consequently the Court there said that this is not an illegal tie-in even though that was obviously in two newspapers out of three, a tie-in that you had to advertise in the morning and evening papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.436" offset="17101093">Similarly, in this case, these motion pictures though copyrighted our interpretation with what the evidence showed 9,000 to 10,000 other copyrighted films available in the market.</text>

            <text syncTime="4270.228" offset="17184266">But there were 8,000 to 9,000 films competing with those films all copyrighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.690" offset="17206105">And if we come to the conclusion that the mere copyright artificially substitutes for the economic power missing in the marketplace as this Court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.977" offset="17243303">He substituted an artificial concept of copyright for the reality that there was no economic dominance in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.050" offset="17271620">If we come to that conclusion, then you reached the absurdity that every article is a monopoly of itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4301.377" offset="17308923">Every owner has control of his own product and consequently no product can be sold in connection with any other product even the same or different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4309.138" offset="17339956">And incidentally, that absurdity was reached in a case in which the Governmet asked this Court to send back the appeal to the District Court and dismiss it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4319.581" offset="17381648">There, the District Court led by -- lured by this argument held that since Guerlain was a unique perfume for itself, although it was in competition with others, that it constituted a monopoly over itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4334.858" offset="17442774">When the case came to this Court, the Government asked that this Court remanded to the District Court and asked the District Court to dismiss that judgment, because you reached that absurdity that any ownership over your own product constitutes a monopoly of that product which isn't the monopoly we talked about in order to protect ourselves under the Sherman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4619.906" offset="18582967">The kind of argument that went on was price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.390" offset="18596968">Since the station have to fill -- had to fill in this time and could only get a standard rate no matter what kind of a picture it shows, it wanted the best pictures obviously in order to have larger attractiveness for its station.</text>
            <text syncTime="4636.689" offset="18650154">But its income did not depend upon how that picture did consequently in order to bring down the price to be within its economic range particularly for fringe time, the kind of argument which has been translated by the Government into forcing which took place normally in the marketplace was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4655.161" offset="18724028">How much is the average price?</text>
            <text syncTime="4656.377" offset="18728835">I need 120 pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4657.689" offset="18734164">Incidentally, they always wanted quantities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4660.145" offset="18743986">I need 500 pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.513" offset="18753390">What's your average price for this package and suppose they fixed $100 as average price.</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.516" offset="18773452">Now, will you drop out 10 of these very bad ones down here and give me five better ones for.</text>
            <text syncTime="4673.128" offset="18795917">That was the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4674.574" offset="18801664">The evidence never revealed a tie-in in the sense that one has it in the Northern Pacific or in any of the other classic IBM cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.923" offset="18839071">And since the Government referred to one case which it deemed horrendous and quoted the evidence, let me illustrate that because I think it dramatically points out what the record really shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.007" offset="18883375">In the very case that Government counsel indicated show tie-in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4701.524" offset="18909497">At record 904, the following -- the Court asked the following question, "What else did you say?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.155" offset="18931963">Did you try to persuade him to offer it on a different basis or something like that?</text>
            <text syncTime="4711.088" offset="18947741">The witness, "I simply told him that the price is out of line for our market."</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.600" offset="18969788">Mr. Gresham, "And on that basis, we are just not interested."</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.075" offset="18987656">A little later, the same witness that he referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4724.472" offset="19001240">Question - "And you were interested on the very sizable quantity of pictures at that time weren't you?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.225" offset="19020257">Answer - "Well, we were interested on the library of films, yes."</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.926" offset="19035094">Question - "And this library wasn't too large if the price was right, is that correct?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4737.896" offset="19054947">No, I would say we were interested on the library at 913.</text>
            <text syncTime="4742.548" offset="19073546">Answer - "I offered him as I recall it $425 for film and that figures up around $300,000."</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.690" offset="19106147">Incidentally Loews' had asked for a million and you just turned them away.</text>
            <text syncTime="4753.541" offset="19117537">This was a biased market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.188" offset="19124120">This very witness testified he kept all the other companies cooling their heels as he put it outside in his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.585" offset="19149720">And I said, Morey, you can take it or leave it $300,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.704" offset="19166229">Question - "Right and he took it?"</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.353" offset="19172812">Answer - "And he took it."</text>
            <text syncTime="4768.861" offset="19178768">Question - "And this was the only proposal, the only offer you ever made to Loew's for the library in concrete terms I mean."</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.510" offset="19209383">Answer - "Yes, sir."</text>
            <text syncTime="4778.064" offset="19215653">Final question, this is the tie-in case the Government found.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.474" offset="19229236">And he hadn't used any oppressive tactics on you in this sale of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4786.303" offset="19248567">He used persuasion as a salesman.</text>
            <text syncTime="4788.332" offset="19256717">Is that right?</text>
            <text syncTime="4789.371" offset="19260897">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.790" offset="19266539">Question - "And you felt you're under no economic, moral, or any other physical force to do what you did."</text>
            <text syncTime="4798.148" offset="19296005">What you did was of your own free will thinking that you have the best deal you could make fairly, is that right?</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.821" offset="19318680">Answer - "We were satisfied with the deal."</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.290" offset="19328502">Question - "The answer to my question is yes."</text>
            <text syncTime="4808.800" offset="19338533">Answer - "Yes."</text>
            <text syncTime="4810.147" offset="19343966">This is the best illustration they have of what they call coercive buying.</text>
            <text syncTime="4815.432" offset="19365073">It was simply an argument of price, the tug and pull in the marketplace to obtain a better deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4824.130" offset="19399868">The cellophane case, coming back to Mr. Justice Douglas' observation about patent because since the lower court did based its entire judgment upon the fact that it was deemed, it deemed itself under the features of that Paramount case to be obliged to find dominance in the market despite the fact that there was no actual economic marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.175" offset="19504044">We have found that the -- in the announces of these cases that whether there is a copyright or not, whether there is a patent or not, the only test is, does that copyright or patent or without it give the seller the dominance in the market sufficient to create the coercion of tie-in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.365" offset="19576874">That is what is illegal and it certainly doesn't exist in this case.</text>

          <turn speaker="myles_j_lane" startTime="4882.854" stopTime="5530.515">
            <label>Mr. Myles J. Lane</label>
            <text syncTime="4882.854" offset="19634761">Mr. Chief Justice, I shall address my argument to point two of appeal Number 43 which just headed the injunctive relief is not warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.634" offset="19705919">I want to make it clear at the outset that these are four separate independent cases that have only one thing in common, and that is there was intense competition among each of the four appellants in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4916.469" offset="19769240">I heard counsel for the Government say that there was substantial number of violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.499" offset="19797347">Well, I want to remind that counsel that as far as Screen Gems was concerned, there were two violations covering a period of four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="4933.009" offset="19835382">And the two violations will be at one station and were made the contracts involved that were entered into 10 months and seven months before the Government started the suit in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.366" offset="19888880">In other words, from September 1956 up-to-date although Screen Gems had entered into 1,500 contracts, the Government was unable to find one single violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4959.408" offset="19941021">I doubt very much whether anybody can consider that substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4964.330" offset="19960665">With respect to Loew's as Mr. Nizer has pointed out, the Government found two violations, three violations to the United Artists, and four for Associated Artists.</text>
            <text syncTime="4977.889" offset="20014895">The total amount of the contracts entered into by Screen Gems was not up in $3 million or $4 million I heard here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4985.809" offset="20046660">The total amount of the Screen Gems contracts are $60,800 and that amount involving 78 pictures, I think the record will show that the stations did not want probably four or five pictures so the total amount of money involved as far as Screen Gems was concerned was about $5,000 to $6,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.770" offset="20154493">I think the question presented here, Your Honors, is whether the District Court molded its decree to fit the necessities of this particular case of whether it neglected the admonition of this Court and also the market that was involved, and the number, and the types of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5036.940" offset="20251146">As Mr. Nizer pointed out, the market here was not motion pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5040.984" offset="20267342">The market here is television programming of which motions -- motion pictures constitute about 7% of the entire market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.809" offset="20314572">This Court not so long ago, enunciated four factors which a District Court must consider in determining whether the moving party, in this case the Government, whether it has met its burden of demonstrating the need for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5075.489" offset="20405373">And those four tests as I quoted are first, the character of the past violations; second, the bona fides of the party's intent to comply with the law; third, the discontinuance of the violations, and the effectiveness of this discontinuance; and fourth, the danger of a recurrence of violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.893" offset="20502967">And using these measures against the situation presented by the various appeals in this case, I shall argue that injunction should not have been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5120.434" offset="20585096">With respect to the first test, the question of the type of character of past violations, the Government has found as I have already pointed out that Screen Gems had two contracts that were held violated out of 1,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="5141.051" offset="20667538">The particular type of violation was not the kind which this Court has enjoined before.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.536" offset="20705468">The lower court found there was no competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5153.975" offset="20719261">There was no -- rather intense competition between all of the defendants in the case below.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.185" offset="20752071">It found out that as between the distributors of old motion pictures and the other type of program and those are live shows, taped shows, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.238" offset="20800345">There was also intense competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5177.301" offset="20812570">And it also found that there was nothing here of an antitrust violation which stifle the programming market.</text>
            <text syncTime="5187.760" offset="20854366">So that with respect to that particular test, it seems to me that it is not the type which this Court has found upon in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.466" offset="20901282">The second factor or test where the intent of the appellants to comply with the law, now the record is clear both to documentary, proof and through the testimony of witnesses at the trial that Screen Gems had a policy of selectivity which was put into effect in March of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="5226.085" offset="21007757">It was a testimony by the former vice president of Screen Gems.</text>
            <text syncTime="5229.980" offset="21023326">There was a testimony by the various salesmen to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5235.328" offset="21044642">And insofar as Loew's was concerned as Government counsel pointed out, Loew's in 1957 put an advertisement in trade papers about their selective policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5248.705" offset="21098141">And I believe as far as United Artists were concerned, they sent telegrams in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="5254.320" offset="21120606">But Screen Gems had its policy through 1956 on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.933" offset="21135130">It was a written policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5259.008" offset="21139414">It's in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5260.474" offset="21145266">It was effectuated throughout that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5263.274" offset="21156446">And as I say, the best indication of good faith on the part of Screen Gems and the other appellants to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5272.785" offset="21194480">In addition to that, the record is replete with instance after instance where these contracts that were put in evidence by the Government in an attempt to show that there was no selectivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.148" offset="21259995">If Your Honors will look at the record, you will see that all of these contracts were contracts where the station was given selectivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.753" offset="21314435">The third criteria were the effectiveness of the discontinuance by the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5311.182" offset="21348080">This was another test which the Government failed to meet in the court below to show a continuance to the violations involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.541" offset="21381517">For example, the record is barren of a single instance, not once in September of 1956 of any attempt on the part of Screen Gems to block book.</text>
            <text syncTime="5338.087" offset="21455705">And I maintain that with all the powers of the Government with the FBI going out and interviewing all of these stations and going through all of our records, the inability of the Government to find one single instance since 1956, a period in which Screen Gems entered into 1,500 contracts as best evidence that there -- of the intent of Screen Gems to give up any violations that they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="5374.195" offset="21600110">If there weren't any violations in 1956, I maintain that there is no need of an injunction at this period.</text>
            <text syncTime="5382.561" offset="21633651">What will the injunction stop if the violation has ceased for the last four or five, or six years and there's no evidence in the record to show that there was any continuance after that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="5397.921" offset="21695091">The last and final test which the Government has been unable to show was this danger as I point out of recurrent violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.262" offset="21764472">The only evidence in the record which indicates the possibility of any recurrence is the testimony of the Government's key witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5426.859" offset="21810761">And I'd like to devote a couple of minutes to that because I think it's most persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5433.116" offset="21835839">The Government called to stand a man by the name of Robert Weisberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="5438.003" offset="21855378">Weisberg was the buyer for an outfit known as TV Television Stations, Inc. and as he testified, he bought for 110 stations which constitute 20% of all the television stations in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5454.037" offset="21919535">Now, obviously, the Government put this man on the stand for one reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="5457.979" offset="21935313">To show that there was a cognizable danger of recurrent violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5464.017" offset="21959450">As I say, this man was the equivalent of putting 110 station witnesses on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="5470.238" offset="21984319">Now, what did he testify to?</text>
            <text syncTime="5473.078" offset="21995708">Instead of testifying as the Government hoped he would, he testified just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="5480.215" offset="22024234">And perhaps this is the reason why the Government has been unable to approve more than two instances of violation against my client and two or three against the other appellants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.731" offset="22070314">He testified that each year, he entered into 5,000 or 6,000 negotiations for these various stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5499.038" offset="22099571">And amazingly enough, he said that in all his experience, that 98% of those negotiations, the parties involved wanted selectivity, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="5514.702" offset="22162160">They wanted to buy in bulk in only two instances or 2% rather of all the cases, did they want selectivity which gives the Court a pretty good idea, number one, of the type -- let's stop here I guess.</text>

            <text syncTime="5537.915" offset="22255052">Well, it gives the Court a fairly good idea of what the policies in the market were at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5544.823" offset="22282637">In other words, the stations wanted bulk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5546.867" offset="22290892">They didn't want selectivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5548.554" offset="22297579">For their own economic reasons, they wanted that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5551.788" offset="22310536">And I say, Your Honors, in conclusion that the function of a court of equity is not to punish past violations but to prevent future violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.502" offset="22361422">And I think as I've demonstrated here, the court below did not meet anyone of the four standards set up by this Court in the Grant case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5624.653" offset="22601958">This company instead of receiving unlimited rights to license the RKO films, television stations, received the right to license those films only in accordance with the terms of a very restrictive contract with International Latex which was entered into for a very sound business reasons on the part of Latex and for the reason on the part of C &amp; C that it couldn't get the RKO financing in any other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5651.813" offset="22710627">And that result was that the RKO pictures could be licensed to television stations only if those stations would make available to C &amp; C for transfer to Latex, a large number of television spots to advertise its product.</text>
            <text syncTime="5668.767" offset="22778441">The large number was needed for a very sound business reasons and C &amp; C had no choice but to comply with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5676.081" offset="22807698">If it made any contracts which did not produce minimum numbers of spots, it could not be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5681.935" offset="22831104">And in that effect of this minimum spot demand in each case on the part of a station was the natural conclusion that as long as they had to give away these many spots, they would take all of the pictures that they could get for that many spots.</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.534" offset="22885543">Now, the District Court observing the practice of television stations and C &amp; C under these arrangements, came to the conclusion, one, that C &amp; C never went to a particular television station and said, "In order to take -- in order to get this RKO picture, you must take that one.</text>
            <text syncTime="5713.940" offset="22959104">Or in order to get some RKO pictures, you must take others or all of our RKO pictures."</text>
            <text syncTime="5720.103" offset="22983764">That is what the complaint defined as block booking.</text>
            <text syncTime="5722.968" offset="22995257">It's what this Court has defined as block booking and Mr. Friedman described as block booking.</text>
            <text syncTime="5728.849" offset="23018768">The Court found instead that C &amp; C conditioned every sale on a minimum price, a minimum price expressed in terms of spots.</text>
            <text syncTime="5738.602" offset="23057742">Then C &amp; C said, this resulted in sales of groups -- I mean the Court said, this resulted in sales of groups of films, therefore, it was block booking and C &amp; C operated under a policy of block booking.</text>
            <text syncTime="5752.433" offset="23113122">Now, it seems to me respectfully that this is error.</text>
            <text syncTime="5755.852" offset="23126810">It's an error based on a full syllogism which runs something like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5760.422" offset="23145096">Every time there is a block book contract, the result is a sale or a license of a group of films.</text>
            <text syncTime="5767.286" offset="23172472">Every time C &amp; C made a spot minimum demand on this television station, the result was a license for a group of filMs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5775.693" offset="23206118">Therefore, C &amp; C's minimum price demand equals block booking.</text>
            <text syncTime="5780.300" offset="23224613">This doesn't necessarily follow and we feel that the legality of C &amp; C's minimum spot demand must be determined not by the result of that policy but by the purpose and the character of the conduct that led up to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5796.118" offset="23287829">Now, Mr. Friedman said, "Nobody in this case challenges the Government's finding that it entered into block booking contracts".</text>
            <text syncTime="5804.861" offset="23322833">C &amp; C does challenge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5806.622" offset="23329834">And the first point we make is that the activities of C &amp; C in demanding minimum numbers of spots was not block booking.</text>
            <text syncTime="5814.742" offset="23362330">We claim it is not block booking, first, because it was not entered into for the purpose of getting a television station to take more than one or several pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5826.753" offset="23410395">It was entered into for the collateral and simple business reason that this was the only way in which C &amp; C could get income from its licensing activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5838.303" offset="23456580">Secondly, in the nature of the C &amp; C contracts with television stations, it's very clear that these stations bought not specific pictures but a bundle of pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5849.291" offset="23500570">For one thing, every C &amp; C license contained what they call the cushion clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5854.318" offset="23520632">C &amp; C was permitted under every contract to deliver 7% to 10% less pictures than the contract call for.</text>
            <text syncTime="5862.338" offset="23552711">There were technical reasons why this was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5865.739" offset="23566294">And any station contracting to license 742 pictures from C &amp; C would have its contract fulfilled of C &amp; C, gave them only 720 pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5876.855" offset="23610807">And there is no way of telling which 720 C &amp; C would give them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5881.307" offset="23628570">Likewise, C &amp; C had an escape clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5883.948" offset="23639124">If it couldn't give a particular license picture to a station, it had the right to give a different picture of comparable quality without specifying what the title of that comparable quality should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="5894.975" offset="23683323">And so it's apparent that when the television stations bought from C &amp; C, they were never sure exactly which titles they were going to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="5903.236" offset="23716342">Secondly, when the C &amp; C contracts went into effect, every station got unlimited runs of all the pictures for 10 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5911.145" offset="23748002">And so, it didn't matter to a television station if out of 742 pictures, it did happen to get two Spanish titled pictures which were in the bundle.</text>
            <text syncTime="5920.159" offset="23784051">C &amp; C just gave them everything it had, but it wasn't the kind of licensing that took place with respect to the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="5927.231" offset="23812263">Now, we claim that in this situation, there is no compulsion on the part of the stations to buy from C &amp; C.</text>
            <text syncTime="5934.931" offset="23843088">This Court held in United States against Bethlehem Steel that economic compulsion or the rest would only be present when two circumstances occurred, one, when there was overpowering strength on one side and feebleness on the other, and two, when the yielding party had no adequate alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="5952.934" offset="23915081">In this case, the record shows clearly that the television stations had the bargaining strength and the distributors were in competition with the host of other suppliers, and secondly, that there were many alternatives if a station didn't like the terms on which C &amp; C offered its pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5969.088" offset="23979760">They could go to other suppliers and suppliers of other programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5973.082" offset="23995747">In these circumstances, yielding to bargaining pressure was merely yielding a preference and not a non-volitional act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5981.463" offset="24029184">The whole business world, every contract has that kind of compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5986.083" offset="24047679">Our second point is that there is a growing recognition in the courts below of a doctrine of business justification where tying is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="5995.008" offset="24083414">When the object and the purpose of tying is something entirely extraneous to the simple benefit or direct benefit of getting a larger share of the market by the leverage of a tie-in device, the courts look to see whether it was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6010.381" offset="24144854">That happened in Dehydrating Process against Smith where there was a valid reason why Smith Company would only sell its unloading device in connection with its own silos.</text>
            <text syncTime="6021.387" offset="24188949">The First Circuit made a very clear opinion of the principles behind this point and this Court denied certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="6028.490" offset="24217370">The same thing took place in United States against General Electric in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6034.247" offset="24240358">The District Court which upheld as an initial practice the right of a new community and 10 assistant companies to sell its component parts only in terms of systems and in connection with the service contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.924" offset="24295111">When the need for that kind of sale disappeared, the tie-in became illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6053.076" offset="24315695">C &amp; C had a very valid business reason for insisting on minimum spots.</text>
            <text syncTime="6057.616" offset="24333876">It was the simple need to get paid from his licensing activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6061.153" offset="24347982">It had nothing to do with whether the stations would take one or more pictures from C &amp; C.</text>
            <text syncTime="6066.587" offset="24369716">Lastly, we say, that this practice in the case of C &amp; C was very reasonable, because in the first place, the device of insisting on minimum spots was no greater than C &amp; C needed to protect this interest in getting paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="6080.678" offset="24426036">Secondly, it had no anticompetitive results.</text>
            <text syncTime="6083.661" offset="24438053">The stations were not precluded by any C &amp; C contract from licensing hundreds and thousands of other feature films from other suppliers and other program material from their resource.</text>
            <text syncTime="6095.020" offset="24483401">No supplier of feature films or television program was ever precluded by a C &amp; C license from doing business with that same station.</text>
            <text syncTime="6103.777" offset="24518510">The Second Circuit in (Inaudible) said this very -- in this very situation that where you have a tie-in with no anticompetitive effects, it is not a violation of the law and this Court denied certiorari, and this in turn is exactly the kind of situation Mr. Black posed as a hypothetical case in Northern Pacific when he said, "If there are a number of groceries in town and one will only sell sugar, if the buyer takes flour and nobody is hurt, this is insignificant tie-in."</text>
            <text syncTime="6136.955" offset="24651212">In conclusion, we say first that it would be impossible as the Government suggested in its brief for C &amp; C to revise its contract with International Latex because unless Latex got all of the spots it needs for its exposure program, it would do no business with C &amp; C.</text>
            <text syncTime="6153.710" offset="24718190">And lastly, we say where the First Circuit and other courts that the antitrust laws do not compel a business like C &amp; C to cut its own throat by licensing on a basis from which it could receive no income.</text>

            <text syncTime="6193.569" offset="24877641">This appeal has been taken by the Government in the five other cases in identical fashion as taken against NTA.</text>
            <text syncTime="6201.320" offset="24908675">The first question raised by the Government --</text>

          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Justin M. Golenbock</label>
            <text syncTime="6204.878" offset="24922885">Yes we do, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="6209.216" offset="24940231">And the first question that was raised by the Government on its appeal is a question as to whether or not, the District Court judge erred in permitting a television distributor in canvassing a market in respect to the acquisition of or distribution of a package of films before licensing anyone or few in that group to a willing purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="6235.169" offset="25044093">This question arose primarily in connection with the contract which NTA entered with a Minneapolis television station.</text>
            <text syncTime="6243.291" offset="25076485">And I do want to mention this contract because I think it bears somewhat on the ultimate determination of this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6252.213" offset="25112221">In that case, it became known into the trades that NTA had available a certain number of feature films which it called the fabulous 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="6260.260" offset="25144404">And the Minneapolis station contacted management of NTA and requested that management to first negotiate with the Minneapolis station before going to its competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6271.992" offset="25191320">In response to that request, the NTA salesman approached the Minneapolis station and conducted negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6280.196" offset="25224129">In the course of the negotiations, the station asked whether or not it would be possible to obtain fewer than a total group of films.</text>
            <text syncTime="6290.327" offset="25264671">NTA required not yet indicating that it wanted to solicit the market, to have an opportunity to talk to the competitors first.</text>
            <text syncTime="6298.876" offset="25298840">Thereafter, a contract was entered into for the entire group of films.</text>
            <text syncTime="6303.461" offset="25317230">Just the course was properly held we believe that so long as it is known to the offeree that the refusal to deal on less than a group is temporary, so long as that refusal of the deal was not disguised as conditioning, so long as it is done in good faith, it is a proper act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6323.983" offset="25399254">As Justice Dawson said, a contract arising from the desire of one party to keep the films away from his competitor does not constitute a block booking contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6339.112" offset="25459858">A similar case occurred in connection with one of the other defendants where while negotiating with two stations in the market, one station requested less than the total group of films.</text>
            <text syncTime="6349.681" offset="25502072">The other station requested all the films and it ultimately entered into a license for all of the films.</text>
            <text syncTime="6356.875" offset="25530911">The Government would have this Court say, in both of these circumstances, that the first station that entered into negotiations would have the priority to determine, to pick and choose among the films and the group that they may wish, and incidentally to deprive the competitors in that market of an opportunity to deal on those films.</text>
            <text syncTime="6376.301" offset="25608547">The Government does say, however, that if this position does not prove to be proper and the action turns out not to be illegal, they like to have such action enjoined by modification of the lower court decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="6391.599" offset="25669778">First, I want to say that the Government's position in respect to this point has shifted since the time of the lower court trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="6399.817" offset="25702588">At that time, the senior trial counsel indicated to Judge Dawson that this point was not an issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6407.872" offset="25734875">Subsequently, the associate trial counsel indicated to Judge Dawson that a distributor need not sell part of a package if at the same time he does have a willing customer to buy all of the packages.</text>
            <text syncTime="6421.269" offset="25788479">Notwithstanding, the position taken in the lower court, the Government now makes this an important point in its appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6430.234" offset="25824319">It's interesting to note, however, that when challenged by the various briefs of the defendants, first is the practicality of this position, and second as to the validity of them, the Government has shifted again and now says that they don't say that a station cannot contact -- a distributor cannot contact all of the stations in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6450.852" offset="25906761">As a matter of fact, they say that a distributor may solicit indications, solicit indications on page 4, Government's reply brief, as to the number of films for the station may desire and also as to the price that the station is willing to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="6470.089" offset="25983770">Now, whatever the ambiguous term solicit indications means, and I don't think that this defendant should be put at the risk of determining it for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="6480.071" offset="26023685">Certainly, there is very little difference between canvassing a market and soliciting invitation -- the soliciting indications.</text>
            <text syncTime="6490.713" offset="26066213">It would appear as if perhaps, the Government has either abandoned its position or has recognized that in any effect it has a very weak position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6500.690" offset="26106128">Mr. Friedman has said to this Court this morning that there's no difference between temporary dealings of the type that I've been talking about and a permanent restrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="6514.724" offset="26162239">He says that as a matter of fact, if a television distributor tells a station that it will not break a group temporarily until it has canvassed the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6528.352" offset="26216782">A television distributor can utilize this approach in every case in which it decides that it wishes to coerce a block book contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="6537.259" offset="26252413">Well, obviously, that's not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="6539.046" offset="26259519">Obviously, Judge Dawson was able to read out from among the few number of cases that he found who have been coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="6545.669" offset="26286059">This case indicated a finding of good faith on a part of a distributor, the matter of the facts under which the distributor works are easily to be found by the trial court and has been found.</text>
            <text syncTime="6561.944" offset="26351156">In respect to the request by the Government further modifications of the decree, there's one prevailing vice in the Government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="6570.553" offset="26385533">They would like to have this Court reviewed this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6573.966" offset="26399222">It's the evidence that they wish they were able to prove in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6578.831" offset="26418657">The Government like any other litigant is bound by its failures and its defaults and the findings of fact by the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6587.232" offset="26452302">In its brief, the Government said that the modifications requested by it are justified in Court, because of the practice of block booking engaged in by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="6599.502" offset="26501413">They also claimed in its brief, that the price differential amendment which is requested by them is justified by the findings of the use of price differentials as a device for block booking.</text>
            <text syncTime="6615.287" offset="26564524">However, in its reply brief, the Government now concedes that there never was any finding of fact by the lower court either as to any policy of block booking or as to the use of price differentials.</text>
            <text syncTime="6627.345" offset="26612799">As a matter of fact, Judge Dawson commented the conclusion of the Government's case that the Government had put in no evidence whatsoever, the price differentials that have ever been used in connection with the conditioning or coercion of block book contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6640.249" offset="26664417">As far as the Baltimore station is concerned which have been cited by Mr. Friedman, I must make it clear that Judge Dawson did not find that there was a price differential use in connection with the contract which he held to be block booked.</text>
            <text syncTime="6654.639" offset="26721886">As a matter of fact, there is considerable testimony in the record, both my Mr. Unger, the president of NTA and others, that because of the quality of the films involved, the particular pricing based on quality of the films was not out of bound and I point out again, Judge Dawson did not so find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6673.585" offset="26797746">As far as the question of price differentials are concerned, I must point out that the Government has adopted for itself an arbitrary standard which has no connection whatsoever with business usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6684.813" offset="26842676">You've heard that the stations like to buy both pictures and they like to pay average prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="6689.649" offset="26862007">The usual negotiation between a station and a distributor involves a negotiation over an average price.</text>
            <text syncTime="6695.529" offset="26885517">The station comes in with a price which may be a little high that is the cost of the negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6701.506" offset="26909445">The distributor in the station then negotiates and reaches a final contract price.</text>
            <text syncTime="6706.698" offset="26930134">The difference between the original offering price and the contract price is not as the Government would have you believe, based either upon an intention to block book or savings and distribution cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="6719.942" offset="26983111">Basically, those differences first come from a negotiating process.</text>
            <text syncTime="6723.854" offset="26998784">In addition, you may have a discount for both or financial pressures may cost the distributor to try to enter into contracts quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6731.473" offset="27029295">The distributor maybe fearful of unknown loses if he's not able to sell his pictures at that time because of new pictures coming into the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6738.003" offset="27055417">All number of reasons is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6740.784" offset="27066493">I think that the Government's proposal in connection with the modification and the decree has been thought up perhaps properly theoretically but it's not connected with the Government as a business usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6755.299" offset="27124590">In closing, I'd like to request that this Court deny the Government's motion for modification of the judgment in recognition of the fact that Judge Dawson has retained jurisdiction of this case and as in Picayune Publishing case and in other similar cases where a judge has retained jurisdiction any future of abuses can be left to its informed hindsight.</text>
            <text syncTime="6779.881" offset="27222915">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="6792.584" offset="27273697">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="6792.957" offset="27275160">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6797.829" offset="27294699">In this Court's decision in the Standard Oil case in 337 U.S., in talking about its previous decision in International Salt, it pointed out that in International Salt, the Court had held that the tie-in agreements by the offer of a patented product, which required the lessee of the salt machines to take unpatented salt was held illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6825.015" offset="27403473">And it said, it so held even though, one, it was not established that equivalent machines were unobtainable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6834.230" offset="27440253">It was not indicated what proportion of the business of supplying such machines was controlled by defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6841.732" offset="27470346">And it was deemed irrelevant that there was no evidence as to the actual effect of the tie-in causes upon competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="6851.525" offset="27509426">Second one, this Court's own opinion in the Times-Picayune case which Mr. Nizer has relied on, specifically pointed out in distinguishing the situation there before the Court involving neither a patented nor a copyrighted article it said as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="6874.223" offset="27600227">Unlike tie-in cases, where patents or copyrights supplied the requisite market control any equivalent market dominance in this case must rest on comparative marketing data.</text>
            <text syncTime="6888.022" offset="27655502">Now, we think that this case is taken together with the Paramount case and the International Salt case, clearly do establish that in a tie-in field where you have a patent or a copyrighted article that itself suffice the monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6903.721" offset="27718301">Of course, these films are not fungible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6905.512" offset="27725406">These films are not fungible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6907.640" offset="27733974">There are two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="6908.493" offset="27737318">First of all, there is evidence in the record in which station owners did testify that it was important to them which particular pictures they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="6916.713" offset="27770232">One example of this was that several of them indicated there were very desires of getting good pictures during the so-called rating weeks, during the period when these various audience surveys were made to see how many people were looking at the screen because this was important for them to try to get a good picture during the rating week.</text>
            <text syncTime="6936.220" offset="27848286">It also seems to me the suggestion that these pictures are fungible and that their particular identity is immaterial to the stations as refuted by the fact that the stations wanted the particular pictures and did not want other pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="6953.178" offset="27916100">Now, I would like, in closing, to just suggest this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6958.501" offset="27937416">If the defendants are correct in their argument that the lack of any dominant or sufficient economic power over the entire market absolves these contracts from invalidity of the Sherman Act, this would lead to this following consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6981.306" offset="28028635">Let us assume for the sake of argument that every single distributor of theatrical motion pictures to television entered into a compulsory block contract with for every single contract, with every single station in the United States, the whole market was tied up this way, under the defendants' theory despite their complete tie up, there would be no illegality because no single defendant itself would have had market dominance over the entire product market.</text>

            <text syncTime="7047.895" offset="28294980">We believe that cannot be that law and we believe that is not the law, and we believe that these contracts are illegal and that in the circumstances, first, the District Court properly found them illegal, second that the District Court properly did grant injunctive relief, and third, that the modifications, we suggest, are necessary to make the relief effective in this.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Nizer</label>
            <text syncTime="7113.526" offset="28557458">May it please Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="7114.912" offset="28562996">A reference to the decree two or three weeks ago, the Government entered into a consent decree with MCA, one of the largest according to its complaint in that action, the largest distributor of motion picture films for television.</text>
            <text syncTime="7132.227" offset="28632273">And in that consent decree, they did not ask for any of the items of relief which they insist are essential here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7139.646" offset="28661948">And if that relief were to be granted in the event, this complaint is upheld, we would be at the disadvantage with respect to the largest competitor who did not have the restrictions upon them by virtue of the Government's consent in that case that those requirements were not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="7154.851" offset="28722761">Secondly, recent MCA's consent decree only two weeks ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="7161.533" offset="28749511">Secondly, the market in this case which the court below found, we did not dominate or have the economic power was the distribution of motion picture film to television.</text>
            <text syncTime="7173.086" offset="28795695">But actually, as the Court further found, that is not the relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="7177.935" offset="28815130">The relevant market is much wider even on that manner of restricted basis, we didn't have economic power.</text>
            <text syncTime="7184.823" offset="28842715">Actually, the market is not the supply of motion pictures, feature films to television, but the entire programming because all the evidence, there was no contradiction is that these are interchangeable vertically in one particular station depending on the segment of time you can have a taped show, a special motion picture film made for television, a cinemascope or a live program, or a motion picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="7210.713" offset="28946265">Horizontally, if you flip the dials, you will find a motion picture in competition with the live show or a quiz show so that the programming is interchangeable, which is one of the tests in the tie-in cases, and their relevant market, therefore, is the entire programming of motion picture -- of entertainment on television.</text>
            <text syncTime="7230.993" offset="29027349">And the record shows that for many years, there were no motion picture films.</text>
            <text syncTime="7235.145" offset="29043963">Indeed, when Your Honor asked whether there'd been a similar case, there was a case in which the Government brought suit in California to compel the motion picture companies to make their films available to television stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="7248.082" offset="29095685">They said these are our competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="7249.570" offset="29101641">We don't want to supply them now because of economic necessity, we do supply them.</text>
            <text syncTime="7254.165" offset="29120031">There is another complaint that we're supplying them too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="7257.523" offset="29133511">But the fact of the matter is that the market involved is the entire programming of which we have 3% to 8% according to the uncontradicted testimony and each defendant has a fraction of less than a half percent of that market, therefore, the complete absence of the requirement of dominance.</text>
            <text syncTime="7276.740" offset="29210311">And one quotation from the cellophane case in view of the question as to whether patent of copyrights applies the practical control.</text>
            <text syncTime="7286.912" offset="29251062">"The power of that automobile or softdrink manufacturers have over their trademark products is not the power that makes an illegal monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="7296.176" offset="29288051">Illegal power must be appraised in terms of a competitive market for the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="7301.663" offset="29309994">And by that test, the competitive market, there were 1,500 of the distributors of 9,000 to 10,000 films as against the few hundred we were distributing."</text>
