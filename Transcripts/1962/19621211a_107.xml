            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="45.496" offset="285341">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.448" offset="301119">Numbers 91, 93, and 107 are companion cases and they are here on writs of certiorari to the Second Circuit and the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.013" offset="359424">These three cases arise out of a single proceeding before the National Labor Relations Board, in which the Board directed an election among the unlicensed seamen onboard a fleet of vessels flying the Honduran flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.005" offset="443434">In general, this litigation deals with the applicability of the National Labor Relations Act to foreign-flag vessels which are engaged in the commerce of this nation and also have other substantial contacts with this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.412" offset="504978">More specifically, the immediate controversy before the Court is whether the jurisdictional reach of the Labor Act extends to a fleet of vessels which fly the Honduran flag, employ Honduran seamen, primarily Honduran Seamen, and have other contacts of the flag nation but which are beneficially owned and operated under the control of an American corporation are engaged in commerce between this nation and foreign nations including the flag nation and carry almost exclusively the products and supplies of the American corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.644" offset="673938">Now, the facts which give rise, the basic facts which give rise to this controversy are essentially not in dispute and I shall summarize them briefly as I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.279" offset="720436">In 1959, the National Maritime Union of America petitioned the Board to certify it as the bargain representative of the unlicensed seamen onboard a fleet of vessels flying the Honduran flag and owner controlled, owner controlled by Empresa, a Honduran corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.628" offset="821896">The N. M. U.'s petition -- the Empresa is a wholly owned subsidiary of United Fruit and the N. M. U.'s petition before the Board named the -- named United Fruit as the employer of the seamen in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.381" offset="904861">For some years, these seamen had been represented by Honduran Union, which I shall call Marineros.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.162" offset="932028">And although Marineros was invited to participate in the proceedings before the Board, it declined to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.452" offset="957210">However, another Honduran Union, the Sindicato, did participate in the Board proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.201" offset="988139">United Fruit, as is well-known, is an American Corporation with its principal place of business in Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.336" offset="1016665">Virtually all of its stock is owned by American citizens and it is engaged in the production of tropical produce, marketing of that produce, and the transportation thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.859" offset="1074761">This annual imports into this country exceed $1 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.490" offset="1097331">United Fruit carries on its operations through approximately 50-60 subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.053" offset="1127633">The subsidiaries handle the day-to-day operations of the enterprise while United Fruit looks to long-ranged development and policies including the purchase, the improvement, and the scrapping or sale of the vessels that are used in the enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.298" offset="1196596">Empresa is one of these subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.845" offset="1210702">It was organized in 1941 by United under the laws of Honduras.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.821" offset="1234631">United supplied all of the capital, presently owns all of the stock, names its directors who in turn, elect the officers of Empresa.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.560" offset="1273605">Empresa, as I say, is organized under the laws of Honduras and its business -- it is engaged solely in the operation of the enterprise's vessels, in owning and operating the enterprise's vessels which are registered under the laws of Honduras.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.144" offset="1347897">It does not carry cargo or passengers on its own account.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.248" offset="1364407">Virtually all of its income is derived from time charters and it -- with a possible occasional exception, it charters -- it time charters its vessels to the parent corporation and the vessels which are involved in this litigation were so charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.644" offset="1429922">Now, Empresa supplies fully equipped, fully manned, and fully provisioned ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.962" offset="1459179">It hires the crews in Honduras.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.616" offset="1469837">The crews are primarily Honduran citizens and they sign Honduran contracts or ship articles, I guess is the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.622" offset="1509857">And, as I say, for some years -- for some years, these crews have been represented by the Honduran Union, the respondent in No. 107.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.642" offset="1557922">United Fruit controls the movements of these ships which are time charters from Empresa and they are used primarily to carry the products -- carry the products of United Fruits' Latin America and Central America operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.499" offset="1629393">They stop at various ports in Central and South America, including those of Honduras, and on their -- they call regularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.247" offset="1668368">They call regularly at United States ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.965" offset="1683205">They are used interchangeably.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.481" offset="1693341">They are used interchangeably by United Fruit which ships with either United Fruit owns directly or which it time charters from other wholly owned American subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.262" offset="1736391">The ships carry the same cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.616" offset="1749870">They call at the same ports and the selection of a ship -- the selection of a ship for any particular trip is determined on the base of size, speed, and availability without regard to the flag or the ownership of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.691" offset="1810160">These, in essence, are the facts which were before the Board and on these facts --</text>

            <text syncTime="713.321" offset="2956622">Now, the Board's order directing this election precipitated two lawsuits, one by Empresa, in the Southern District of New York, and the other one by the Marineros, a Hungarian Union in the Southern -- in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.821" offset="3026631">Each sought to enjoin the Board from holding the election, asserting that the Board had exceeded its statutory powers in asserting jurisdiction over these vessels for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.167" offset="3083995">The upshot of this litigation was that both Courts, both the Court of Appeals -- Court of Appeals the for the Second Circuit and the District of Columbia Court, held that the Board had exceeded its statutory jurisdiction in asserting that -- in asserting its authority over its -- in seeking to assert authority over these vessels and both Courts enjoined the Board from proceeding with the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.618" offset="3181798">Now, the rationale of the two decisions is somewhat different and I should like to state the difference briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.324" offset="3208652">The District of Columbia Court held that the Act did not apply to a vessel which, as in this case, flew a foreign-flag and which had foreign crews who had been engaged under contracts pursuant to foreign laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.180" offset="3280123">The District of Columbia Court here apparently gave decisive weight, decisive and dispositive weight to the fact that these boats here were registered here under the laws of a foreign nation and through the flag of that nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.304" offset="3332577">Now, the Second Circuit, on the other hand, took the position that, while acknowledging -- while acknowledging that the flag was of cardinal importance, nevertheless, it agreed with the Board that the weight to be given to the flag would depend upon an evaluation in the context of the policies of this statute upon an evaluation of the interacting American and foreign interest, the substantiality of the American contacts as compared to the substantiality of the foreign contacts, and the weighing of these competing considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.487" offset="3473324">On that premise -- on that premise, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the contacts with Honduras were sufficiently substantial to outweigh the American contacts and that therefore, the Board does not have jurisdiction over these particular vessels.</text>

            <text syncTime="1319.998" offset="5383398">If the court should disagree with the court below that the Honduran contacts outweigh the American contacts, then it has to face the basic question of whether flag is decisive or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1346.756" offset="5490395">Now, we think that the court -- we think that the court should address itself to that problem because the issue is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.902" offset="5519026">It's properly presented here and there's much litigation with respect to this matter here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.091" offset="5547760">In fact, presently, there is pending in the Fifth Circuit, a case of this kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="1379.619" offset="5621844">And finally, I suggest, Your Honor, I suggest that this is not the kind of an issue that should be deferred because I don't think the future is going to bring any further insights into this problem than the court will have today -- we'll have today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.346" offset="5684746">And for all these reasons -- for all these reasons, we suggest that the Court deal with the basic question to determine whether or not the Board, as I say, has any business at all in this area and, if so, to what extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.483" offset="5745351">Now, it is the -- I just want to round up the economic picture a little bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.274" offset="5796446">I've already indicated -- I've already indicated that a great majority of the American-flag -- of these American vessels that are owned by American interest and that fly -- the Panlibhon flags have no contacts with those nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.576" offset="5857677">And the few that do, as in this case, have only contacts with the flag nation in connection with the American-based enterprises' operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.066" offset="5895607">And an interesting facet -- an interesting facet of this Flag of Convenience development is that today, Liberia, which I take it is not an oil producing country, has the largest and most modern tanker fleet in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.890" offset="5950882">And, to round out the economic pictures I said a moment ago, one of the inducements for this kind of an operation is that these shipping interests can hire foreign seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.648" offset="5998007">In fact, they almost always hire foreign seamen, had wages lower than those which prevail on American boats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.634" offset="6021935">And as a result -- and as a result, the American Unions have become quite concerned of course because the tremendous drop -- tremendous drop in the employment of American seamen.And this concern has triggered off the organizational efforts which found their culmination in this type of case.</text>
