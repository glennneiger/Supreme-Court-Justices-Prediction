            <text syncTime="25.339" offset="204779">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.688" offset="222124">This case presents a narrow question of statutory interpretation, but a question which is fundamental to the process of resolving disputes under government contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.323" offset="280639">In this case, the Court of Claims has reversed administrative findings of fact as not supported by substantial evidence on the basis of evidence, which had never been presented to the administrative decision maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.824" offset="346676">The administrative findings were made pursuant to the Standard Disputes Clause of government contracts, which in effect charges certain government officials with resolving factual disputes arising under the contract and it makes their decisions final.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.136" offset="423894">The Wunderlich Act, which is before us here today, provides for judicial review of such decisions for arbitrariness fraud or lack of substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.357" offset="472795">And the question presented therefore is whether, as the Court of Claims has held, a Court reviewing such findings is free to upset them as not being supported by substantial evidence or as being arbitrary on the basis of evidence, which has never been presented to the administrative decision maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.192" offset="564120">It is of course our position that judicial review under the Wunderlich Act, like judicial review in most other instances, is to be made only on the administrative record and not on the basis of evidence, which is never been before the administrative decision maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.443" offset="637158">I'll note that our position is supported by the decision of every District Court and Court of Appeals, which has passed on this issue.</text>

            <label>Mr. David L. Rose</label>
            <text syncTime="143.765" offset="678431">Well, I would say that at least one has clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.731" offset="698284">I think that two others have clearly indicated that this is the view they take.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.849" offset="730781">In order to set the issue in its context, I should like briefly to recall to the Court the facts which give rise to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.062" offset="767666">In July 1946, the respondent was a successful bidder on a contract to build an earthen dam in Upper New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.456" offset="801207">Included in the contract was the construction of certain outlet works, including a tunnel, which was to be 710 feet in length and which was to be aligned with concrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.248" offset="848332">The tunnel was designed to carry water from in front of the dam to the stream below it, it was not designed for the people to go through.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.896" offset="886993">The tunnel was to be constructed through rock and was to be free standing that is, it was designed on the premise that the rock was sufficiently stable to allow the tunnel to stand without any permanent ceiling supports, except for a short period -- short piece at either end of 50 feet in length.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.278" offset="964524">By the end of March 1947, a subcontractor had dug the tunnel through or, hold the tunnel out to use the engineering terminology, without ceiling supports of any kind either permanent or temporary.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.801" offset="1018546">Before placing the concrete however, a factual dispute arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.491" offset="1041324">The respondent took the position that the underground rock was materially different from that which have been shown in this specifications in borings and that permanent steel supports were necessary in order to hold the tunnel up and that they should be installed at the government’s expense before placing the concrete.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.989" offset="1127320">It sought the payment under Article 4 of the contract, which has to do with conditions materially different from those shown in the specifications are normally to be expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.561" offset="1173608">The contracting officer denied the respondent's claim on the ground that the rock was in fact sufficiently stable for a free standing tunnel, and that it was of a kind which was to be expected from the borings in specifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.708" offset="1234213">Pursuant to the disputes clause, respondent appealed to the Corps of Engineers Claims and Appeals Board, which held a full trial type hearing where each side introduced all the evidence it desired to introduce.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.858" offset="1290846">Respondent produced nine witnesses there, but introduced the testimony of only four, including engineers and a geologist.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.622" offset="1325850">The government introduced the testimony of three witness, all of whom had personal knowledge of the fact and whose testimony fully supported the government's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.959" offset="1363257">I think the geologist's testimony on each side is the critical testimony before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.886" offset="1390947">The record before the Board was in our view, a classic instance of sharply conflicting testimony by lay and expert witnesses who had personal knowledge of the facts and where the finder of fact could reasonably find either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.840" offset="1462732">The Board found that the underground rock was of a kind to be expected and that permanent tunnel protection was unnecessary, thereby sustaining the contracting officer's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.257" offset="1516440">The respondent filed a suit in the Court of Claims approximately six years later.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.863" offset="1578820">I should add that the hearing before the Board was conducted, three years prior to the Wunderlich Act and that the suit was filed here approximately a few months after the Wunderlich Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.548" offset="1645589">The testimony was heard before a Commissioner of the Court of Claims who took evidence de novo over the strenuous objections of Government Counsel, evidence which had never been presented to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.454" offset="1689161">The respondent introduced testimony of approximately 15 witnesses and approximately six or seven times as many exhibits as it had in the administrative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.897" offset="1734928">The Commissioner made independent findings, principally on the basis of the evidence, which had not previously been presented on the basis of the evidence, which was not before the Board, and the Court of Claims overturned the Board's findings and awarded judgment to the respondent of approximately $150,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.116" offset="1815803">It did not find that the Board's findings where arbitrary or unsupported by substantial evidence on the basis of the evidence before the Board, but it held that it was entitled to receive evidence de novo, which had never been before the Board and that on the basis of all the evidence, including the evidence received de novo, the Board's decision was not supported by substantial evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="789.763" offset="3262464">I think the terms that Congress has used here are the subtle and traditional terms for a review of factual findings both by the administrative bodies and it's quite an analogous to the situation of the Court in a jury case.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.948" offset="3339160">The term fraudulent is merely preserving the pre-Wunderlich situation and it's not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.072" offset="3375626">The terms arbitrary and capricious are antonyms of course for the term reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.315" offset="3408645">Similarly, a decision cannot be so grossly erroneous as necessarily to imply bad faith, if it's a reasonable decision, because if a reasonable man could make it, then there is no need or no possibility indeed of inferring bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.476" offset="3465279">And lastly, the term supported by substantial evidence as the House Report, which reported the final bill, which became the Wunderlich Act stated quoting this Court's decision in the Consolidated Edison Company Case, “the term substantial evidence means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="862.019" offset="3551483">In other words, evidence that a reasonable person could accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.354" offset="3572799">As we see it then, Congress in this traditional and subtle language has said that the administrative resolution of factual disputes is binding if it was honestly made and if it's reasonable and the Court's function therefore, as we understand it, is limited to seeing to it that the adjudicator, the administrative officials acted honestly and reasonably and their review is limited to that scope.</text>

            <text syncTime="1097.530" offset="4493458">I think the Needles case, which we cite in the Dean case or Young case, indicate that the Court of Claims could not base its decision on evidence, which was not before the decision maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.314" offset="4548629">At any rate, this Court in the Ripley case, which I have just referred to made that quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.920" offset="4571094">There are three cases, three decisions in the same case there, where this Court sent the case back to the Court of Claims to ascertain what the decision maker knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.411" offset="4609024">And since that -- that was the only basis in which the decision could be overturned, on the basis of what the decision maker knew, on the basis of evidence that was before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.383" offset="4664926">And therefore, as we understand it, the review was for reasonableness in factual findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.300" offset="4700557">And if it is a review for reasonableness, the evidence which was never before the decision maker can have no bearing on that review, because the decision can't be condemned as unreasonable on the basis of material that was never before the decision maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.446" offset="4761161">Now the term substantial evidence is of course by now deeply routed in our jurisprudence both in decisions and statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.066" offset="4791672">And we think it is quite significant that in every statute in which Congress has passed providing for such review, judicial review for substantial evidence, it has met judicial review upon the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.492" offset="4853321">We collect some of those statutes in pages 24 and 25 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.419" offset="4873070">And indeed in every statute where Congress has provided for judicial review without setting forth a standard, it has been held by this Court and it has been held and Congress has gone along, that review was on the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.561" offset="4933569">As Mr. Justice Brandeis, said speaking for Unanimous Court, a proceeding under the Packers and Stockyards Act is a judicial review, it's not a trial de novo, this is page 26 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.571" offset="4981635">The validity of an order of the secretary therefore like that of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission must be determined upon the record of the proceedings before him.</text>

            <text syncTime="1245.941" offset="5087169">Absolutely Your Honor, indeed the title of the Act is an Act to provide review, meaning judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.378" offset="5120920">Well, that brings us then to the legislative history of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.566" offset="5137638">The Court of Claims has indeed recognized the logical weakness in its position, but has said in effect that this is what Congress intended and therefore we have to go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.831" offset="5190719">It's our position that the legislative history shows not only that Congress intended to use these terms, these subtle terms in their traditional and subtle meaning to provide for judicial review on the administrative record, but also that Congress added the standard of substantial evidence specifically to require each side to present it's case fully and openly to the administrative officers or Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.686" offset="5298134">And that its intent is only consistent therefore with a view that substantial evidence means substantial evidence before the decision maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.239" offset="5336377">That Congress used the terms in their traditional and subtle meaning, is clear from the House Report the report on the final bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.062" offset="5367620">On page four of that report there is reference to the terms arbitrary and capricious and Congress notes that these are the terms that's used in the Administrative Procedure Act, and also refers to the Ripley case to which I have just adverted and where this Court said, a Court of Claims decision could be upset only in the basis of facts known to the decision maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.190" offset="5448182">Similarly, the term substantial evidence Congress noted was included in the Administrative Procedure Act where of course review for substantial evidence is on the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.770" offset="5494471">And Congress referred to this Court's decision in the consolidated Edison case, which was a case under the National Labor Relations Act where again review is on the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.056" offset="5547551">So we think it is clear that Congress intended to use these terms, knew it was using terms that had a subtle meaning and knew what that meaning was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.656" offset="5577958">Now, the main purpose of the Wunderlich Act, I think as everyone will concede was to provide or restore judicial review in situations other than fraud and bad faith, but there is another purpose and I would like to direct the Court's attention to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.666" offset="5634069">In the last two pages of our brief, pages 59 and 60, we quote from the House Report and I'll summarize, it's at the bottom of pages 59 and 60, and I'll summarize the beginning of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.738" offset="5686314">It had come to the attention of Congress that some of the administrative hearings were not full hearings in that the records were inadequate and Congress sought to change that situation and how, what instrument that it used to change the situations, the substantial evidence test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.744" offset="5762382">If you look at the last line of page 59, this is the House Report on the bill that was finally reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.599" offset="5793729">It is believed that if the standard of substantial evidence is adopted this condition will be corrected and the records of hearing officers will here after contain all the testimony and evidence upon which they have relied in making their decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.939" offset="5851094">And Congress went on to say, this is in effect to require each party to present openly its side of the controversy and afford an opportunity of rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.816" offset="5890591">Now Congress could use that term substantial evidence in order to effect this result, only if it understood the term substantial evidence to mean substantial evidence on the record, because if either side could withhold evidence from the Board and then introduce it in Court to sustain or upset the decision there would not be this necessity of introducing it's case fully before the Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="1547.068" offset="6291623">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.709" offset="6310222">Government counsel hasn't commented at all on the testimony of the witnesses before the congressional committees of the Senate and the House at the hearings in connection with this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.138" offset="6367901">We deem that's very important to arrive at a fair interpretation of the provisions of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.196" offset="6392142">Now the main force behind this legislation was the construction industry and the representatives of that industry were very wrote up over the Wunderlich decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.010" offset="6443447">They were joined by the General Accounting Office who felt that their statutory authority had been taken away from them, the authority to adjust and settle claims by and against United States have been taken away from them by the Wunderlich decision and so they joined industry in an effort to obtain this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.180" offset="6552116">Now the only opposition to the legislation was the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.507" offset="6589419">The industry witnesses have hailed the Wunderlich decision in strongest terms barring again and again from the dissenting opinions, the language used in the dissenting opinion in the Wunderlich decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.305" offset="6656606">The plea of the industry and all of this is on the record, was that they get back to the position that they were in prior to the Wunderlich decision and that the Court of Claims be permitted to exercise the same jurisdiction that it always had exercised over -- in testing the decisions of these contracting agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.405" offset="6776978">And their testimony is very clear that they interpreted the proposed legislation as doing just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.290" offset="6824521">The testimony of the many witnesses to this effect is referred to in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.271" offset="6860466">One of the leading Advocates of this legislation was the Associated General Contractors and their plea was that the Committee draft legislation that will grant the Courts, “Jurisdiction to hear determine and enter judgment against United States on any claims in which the Courts – in which the contractors will seek review.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.927" offset="6971120">Now they act as a substantial evidence standard, be applied and that the Courts be authorized to render judgment, “On the evidence presented to the Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.415" offset="7041024">The testimony of the General Accounting Office witness with respect to the proposed bill was and I quote that there should -- “that they would be restored to the Courts and to the General Accounting Office, their present jurisdiction or their normal proper jurisdiction.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.192" offset="7120123">The bill as finally enacted, adapted the language proposed by the General Accounting Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.643" offset="7161919">There really was no sponsor before the Congressional Committees for the government's present position that review be restricted to the administrative record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.679" offset="7214059">Congress was made fully aware of these standards applied by the Court of Claims in reviewing these contracting agency decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.178" offset="7256064">They were informed that over a period of many years the standards arbitrary and capricious had been employed and that the Court of Claims had also recognized the substantial evidence rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.635" offset="7329938">Government counsel states here that pre-Wunderlich the standard was limited to fraud and bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.760" offset="7382392">In that connection may I read from the government's petition for writ in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.998" offset="7415411">At page 10, they say there is no doubt that Congress passed the Wunderlich statute in order to make certain that judicial review of an administrative decision under the disputes clause would also be available where the contractor establishes arbitrariness and capriciousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.667" offset="7490017">In this respect, Congress can be said simply to have codified the view many times by -- reiterated by this Court prior to its decision in United States v. Wunderlich.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.587" offset="7553755">Congress was also, in this testimony taken at these hearings, fully appraised of the fact that the Court of Claims permitted the presentation of evidence in open court in testing these administrative decisions of these contracting agencies and that they had done so over a period of many, many years going back to 1911 in the Ripley decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.937" offset="7703071">And Congress was informed why it was so necessary for the contractors that the Court of Claims exercise jurisdiction in this manner, that this disputes clause was not a matter of negotiation between the contractor and the contracting officer, but neither had the authority to modify it or change it in anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.610" offset="7805785">Congress was told to through the mouths of the witnesses that a Board composed of employees of the contracting agency was no adequate substitute for an impartial review by the Court so that it will be just as impartial as trying a case before a jury composed entirely of the contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.419" offset="7909021">Congress was told about the inadequate hearing procedures afforded by these contracting agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.484" offset="7937337">The fact that the contractor would go in and present their witnesses, they would be subjected to cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.662" offset="7974013">The Government would produce no witnesses of its own or in those cases where the government did produce witnesses, the Congress was informed that these Boards relied on ex-party statements, some of which were made by the very officials whose decisions where the subject matter of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.897" offset="8070980">These contracting agencies had no statutory power to conduct a fair hearing, whether or not a hearing was afforded or whether a record was made less entirely in the discretion of the head of the department.</text>

            <text syncTime="2495.964" offset="10087215">Now that certainly does -- then the committee reported -- the committee adopted this suggestion, even incorporated some of the language of the witness in their report, but it seems unlikely that the committee would use the material drawn from a testimony of a witness who interpreted the act as not restricting review from the administrative record and from that testimony draw a conclusion entirely different from that of the witness, of this same witness who testified with respect to the conduct of the proceedings and commenting on the substantial evidence rule, made reference to the Administrative Procedure Act to show that it had comparable substantive standards with a body of law interpreting them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3649.276" offset="14700440">In the 15 years prior, this in the record of the hearings, in the 15 years prior to the Wunderlich decision, there are only 48 cases out of thousands and hundred -- apparently, thousands and thousands that went to the Court of Claims under the disputes clause and of those 48 cases, only 16 where the Board decisions were reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.167" offset="14816005">They only had about three a year, but it's vital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.144" offset="14827917">The important part of it is the contracting officer and even back at that level, this is all under testimony, knows that his decision isn't going to be final as soon as it reaches a level of the head of department that sometime a Court can look at it and it makes a fair deal between the government and the contractor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3743.981" offset="15079320">The first is that I would agree that the association of General Contractors of America was a moving force in the Wunderlich Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.409" offset="15112965">Page 29 of the senate hearings, this is the review that they sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.013" offset="15135431">The position of the association as we believe that any decision should be subject to judiciary review in order to guarantee that such decision is reasonable, made with due regards to the rights of both contracting parties, and this is a key part, and supported by the evidence upon which the decision was based, and that is what they sought and that we submit as what they got, when they got the substantial evidence test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.916" offset="15239084">Mr. Gaskins who was a contractor representative and one of the leading spokesman for the contractors when asked what kind of review it would be in Court, said “It will be an appellate review.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3796.267" offset="15288404">Now the term appellate review to me, means review on the record and that is precisely what we contend here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3829.913" offset="15422986">Now, I should like to make this point at the end.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.939" offset="15435107">The purpose of the disputes clause is to provide an expert an inexpensive forum for the quick resolution of factual disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3843.393" offset="15476903">This court has approved the disputes clause and Congress in the very passage of the Wunderlich Act approved it subject to judicial review for substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.572" offset="15513684">The taking of evidence de novo frustrates that purpose in two basic ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.633" offset="15533955">It makes the resolution of factual disputes both expensive and time consuming.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.087" offset="15555688">Here we have 17 years that this dispute has been going on whereas the dispute before the Board was over an year-and-a-half, and the tremendous expense of two trials on the same issue of liability the -- whereas one hearing before the Board, there were three hearings in three separate cities San Francisco, Washington and Boston in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3884.917" offset="15643042">There is a tremendous expense involved and a tremendous duplication of effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.159" offset="15659969">Our opposition will eliminate one whole trial type hearing and therefore accord with the original intent, which was to provide an expeditious and inexpensive forum.</text>
