            <text syncTime="11.779" offset="150444">Thank you, Your Honor, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.014" offset="167476">At the conclusion of the argument yesterday, I think we had left only one point uncovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.824" offset="190673">That is the respondent’s argument not referred to in the courts below but presumably made there that the National Labor Relations Act doesn’t apply to the area involved in this case because the plaintiff is a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.623" offset="273847">I would like to be brief and I think to brief this way of disposing that argument is to point out that it's flatly contradicted by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.938" offset="311150">It appears that a superintendent is a supervisor, I say it appears, although that question has not been decided, but the plaintiff sued not only for a loss of employment as a superintendent, but for the union’s action in preventing him from obtaining employment as a foreman, and a foreman on this record or a pusher is at least arguably and we think demonstrably an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.745" offset="450330">He's covered by the collective bargaining unit, he's covered by the agreement, he is required to be a member of the union, he works with the men, he has -- bears none of the indicia, normal indicia of a supervisor.</text>

            <text syncTime="110.039" offset="543535">Despite the fact that it's clear that the jury and the Court of Appeals below and everybody consider this as a suit for loss of employment as a foreman as well as a superintendent.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.116" offset="583868">It is also clear that were this not so and to had this suit only for a loss of employment as a superintendent, we think it is clear that this is also in the area which Congress has regulated by the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. David E. Feller</label>
            <text syncTime="138.910" offset="658996">Well on the approach that supervisors are not excluded from the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.451" offset="685223">They are excluded from the definition of employee for a specific reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.304" offset="708629">Congress decided and Senator Taft -- this is Senator Taft's view really that supervisors are to be identified with management.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.753" offset="746350">They're a part of management.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.458" offset="753246">The employer can fire him or hire him without regard to union activity or anti-union activity and they're to be identified with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.020" offset="787414">Now that doesn't mean that Congress hasn't made a decision about supervisors or regulated supervisors, but what it means is the Congress has said they are not to be given employee protection against employer action and indeed following that theory they went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.845" offset="854706">They said they are to be giving protection against union action because they are members of management.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.040" offset="879574">And in Section 8 (b) (1) (B) of the Act they made it an unfair labor practice for a union to restrain or coerce an employer in the selection of his representatives for the purpose of collective bargaining or the adjustment of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.042" offset="939551">And as we quote Senator Taft in our brief, he said, the purpose of this was to say is to prevent a union, and I quote here from the legislative history of the Act, to prevent a union from quote, saying to the employer, “You have to fire Foreman Jones, we do not like Foreman Jones and therefore you have to fire him or we will not go to work.”</text>
            <text syncTime="232.812" offset="1034637">That was the purpose of 8 (b) (1) (B).</text>
            <text syncTime="235.843" offset="1046758">Now, in other words, Congress regulated the whole area of union action affecting the employment rights of both employees and supervisors, but it regulated them differently.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.789" offset="1234526">Damages or loss of employment rights were admitted to be within the power of the state in that case because the court did not want to separate a unitary remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.691" offset="1282173">It seemed to be conceded in Gonzales that a suit based on union action to deprive the member of his employment would be preempted that a suit to deprive him of his rights as a member of the union, and indeed Section 8 (a) (3) of the Act, which Your Honors had an opportunity to consider this last week, intended to separate the whole Act, membership rights from employment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.771" offset="1402441">And what the Court said as we have one thing which is exclusively federal, one thing -- area in which the state can act and they said as a kind of pendent jurisdiction we will allow the state to give the remedy in the federal area because it is part of a lawsuit which the state clearly has jurisdiction of.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.431" offset="1477047">And in the first appeal in this case, the Supreme Court of Ohio took out the state area of action here.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.201" offset="1500139">So we have -- the best argument is we have pendent jurisdiction with nothing to pend to.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.720" offset="1714239">Well, I think that it is at least arguable, (a) that if he is a supervisor, it was an unfair labor practice for the union to do what it did here, and for the one reason I gave and for another reason there are cases cited in our brief in which the Board has held it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to fire a supervisor because the effect of that firing under those circumstances will have to encourage or discourage employees in membership of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.182" offset="1852061">I don't want to go in that detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.743" offset="1858330">That's the second reason why it was arguably an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.205" offset="1872227">And the third string, if I may barrow from Mr. Warren yesterday, the third string is that even if there were no argument as to whether if he were a supervisor there'd be an unfair labor practice, it is at least arguable whether he is a supervisor here and relies underneath the case. And that I think three strings, three arrows are enough to dispose of that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.489" offset="1961357">And so I like to conclude and save a minute or two for rebuttal if I may?</text>

            <text syncTime="506.602" offset="2129795">This situation in my way of thinking is comparable to a wrestling match when one of the opponent strikes the other one below the belt and when the referee looks at him, he said, “I didn't do a thing” and that's just what happened in our trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.356" offset="2196773">The union denied doing anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.806" offset="2206595">They didn't present any evidence that the activity that they participated in was a protected concerted activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.188" offset="2236165">They pled a defensive concerted activity, but they didn't bring any evidence in at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.635" offset="2265945">Now, it strikes me that in order for there to be an unfair labor practice, there must be a coercion or intimidation of rights that are protected under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.532" offset="2305546">29 U.S. Code Section 152 specifically exempts supervisors from the operation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.268" offset="2332400">The Act deals with employees and supervisors are not employees according to the plain simple language of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.631" offset="2369912">And I feel that because of his being exempted from the Act, they must show that this was a protected, concerted activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.843" offset="2402722">Now, the record clearly shows they -- the record clearly shows that they had no right under their own constitution to take away Mr. Perko's foreman's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.278" offset="2456534">He needed his foreman's rights in order to act as a superintendent and he was a superintendent, the record is clear as to that on that day that the trouble started with his own union.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.716" offset="2498226">There's no question about his being a superintendent supervising the different crafts that work under five different crafts.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.419" offset="2529050">Now, if they violated their own constitution, Section 45 of their own constitution that they had no right to deprive him of his foreman's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.504" offset="2565413">They say we didn't do it and yet the evidence and the facts the jury found that they did do it because he couldn't give orders to his men.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.535" offset="2597491">That can't be deemed as a type of activity that would encourage membership if they violate their own constitution.</text>
