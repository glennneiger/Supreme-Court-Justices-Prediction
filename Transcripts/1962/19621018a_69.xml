            <label>Mr. Howard P. Willens</label>
            <text syncTime="46.556" offset="289625">This case comes before the Court on direct appeal from the District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Acts and involves the construction of the federal mail fraud statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.313" offset="344586">Prosecution under the mail fraud statute requires proof of two elements; first, a scheme and artifice to defraud and second, use of the mails for the purpose of executing the fraudulent scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.877" offset="402892">This case involves an issue dealing with the second statutory requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.417" offset="429014">The specific question raised is whether the mails were used for the purpose of executing the particular scheme set forth in this indictment, in view of the fact, that the mails were used after the moneys had been obtained by the defendants from their so-called victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.848" offset="506755">The 44-count of indictments set forth in the record charges 23 individual defendants and the defendant, Lenders Service Corporation, the violations of the mail fraud and conspiracy statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.551" offset="561612">Count one of the indictment described in some detail the alleged scheme and artifice to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.924" offset="587107">In brief, the count describes the plan of the defendants to defraud small businessmen for entering and securing loans or in selling their businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.603" offset="633814">Defendants would represent to take or provide valuable services to assist these businessmen in return for a fee, a portion of which was to be paid in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.214" offset="684178">The indictment specified that in fact the defendants did not intend to perform the services contracted for and in fact did not intend to perform any services designed to be valuable in assisting these businessmen in obtaining their objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.184" offset="744155">In order to affect their scheme, the indictment states that the defendants organized three corporations including the defendant, Lenders Service Corporation, and commenced the program of hiring and training salesmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.513" offset="801416">The indictment indicates that these salesmen were trained by the defendants in the use of evasions, half-truths and innuendos.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.099" offset="835793">The plan called for the contacting by these salesmen of prospects who had expressed an interest in the services of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.889" offset="870902">The salesmen would then engage in a personal interview of these prospects.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.297" offset="892531">Throughout this personal interview, the indictment alleges that the salesmen engaged in a number of substantial false and fraudulent representations.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.437" offset="937148">Among other things, the salesmen misrepresented they’re on training and competence to evaluate the business needs of the prospects.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.323" offset="972675">The salesmen also misrepresented the facilities available to the defendants to assists these small businessmen and would also represent on occasion the interest rates and other terms at which loans might be made available through the assistance of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.044" offset="1039548">The thrust of all these misrepresentations of course according to the indictment was to secure the signature of the prospect on a -- of a document, on a document called a financial service agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.753" offset="1090435">This document in effect was an application for the services to be provided by the defendants and called for the payment of a fee by the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.360" offset="1132857">According to the indictment, the next step involved the acceptance by the defendants of these applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.736" offset="1162324">According to the indictment, the defendants accepted these applications indiscriminately so long as the fee was paid in cash and so -- or so long as they had been paid by cashier’s check which could be transformed into cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.388" offset="1216972">The indictment charges that this defendant accepted the application had made no effort to evaluate such things as the qualifications of the prospect or the facilities which the defendant might in fact be able to develop in order to assist the prospect in obtaining the desired goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.230" offset="1292309">According to the indictment, the defendants would then mail a copy of the accepted contract in a form letter to the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.042" offset="1335568">According to the indictment as set forth at page 8 of the record, the defendants mailed a copy of the accepted contract and a form letter, “For the purpose of lulling said victims by representing that their applications had been accepted and that the defendants would therefore perform for said victims the valuable services which the defendants had falsely and fraudulently represented that they would perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.914" offset="1442983">That a further purpose thereof was to inform said victims that they could not obtain a refund of their fees and that the contract was not cancellable and that the said victim was bound thereby and had no recourse for retrieving his money.”</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard P. Willens</label>
            <text syncTime="372.620" offset="1593866">According to the indictment after the mailing of this accepted contract and form letter, the scheme entailed a continued relationship between the defendants on the one hand and their victims on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.771" offset="1646425">According to the indictment, the defendants after securing certain financial information for their -- from various sources would prepare what they call a business and financial report for submission to lending institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.594" offset="1697729">Prior to the submission of these reports to lending institutions, the indictment states that the defendants would mail a proofed copy of this report to the applicants for their approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.113" offset="1747780">The indictment state that in fact these business and financial reports were mailed, but again with no effort to correlate the type or extent of loan requested with the nature, type or lending practices of any particular lending institution in the relevant geographical area.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.576" offset="1817684">The indictment and its description of the fraudulent scheme by alleging that on those occasions when complaints were made by the victims the defendants would pretend to investigate when complaints were made -- were made regarding misrepresentations of the salesmen, for example, the indictment alleges that the defendants would contact the salesmen and encourage the particular salesman to deny that any misrepresentations had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.226" offset="1920293">At that point, the defendants according to the indictment would contact the victim, inform him of the salesmen denial and tell him that for that reason no portion of the advance fee could be refunded.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.184" offset="1972120">At this point and throughout, the scheme set forth in this indictment, the defendants would continue to assure their victims that valuables services had been performed and would continue to be performed by the defendants on the applicant’s behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.626" offset="2029902">After setting forth this scheme and artifice to defraud, the first 43-counts of the indictment charge specific mailings which were said to be for the purpose of executing the scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.855" offset="2074833">The last count of the indictment charges a conspiracy to use the mail to defraud in violation of Section 371 of Title 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.846" offset="2110777">In the District Court, the defendants made four separate motions to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.528" offset="2129481">In response to these motions, the government filed what was called a supplemental brief which is printed in the record beginning at page 37.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.966" offset="2159261">This supplemental brief was subsequently treated as a bill of particulars by the District Court to the extent it described the mailings involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.957" offset="2191235">In fact, the supplemental brief did describe in some detail the 43 mailings relied upon as the basis for the 43 substantive mail fraud counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.195" offset="2232195">In this supplemental brief, the Government indicates that two of the 43 counts were based upon the mailings of newspaper advertisements which the defendant caused to be mailed in its effort to secure the services of salesmen for its enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.595" offset="2297710">Seven of the mailings dealt with the mailings of brochures.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.165" offset="2315995">A sample brochure was attached to the supplemental brief and is printed at pages 52 and 53.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.726" offset="2338252">This brochure was mailed by the defendants to two prospects prior to the visit of any salesmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.249" offset="2368345">The brochure, a sample of which is in the record is called when our salesmen -- when our representative calls and it describes various commercial financing alternatives available to small businessmen and described certain specific banks as correspondent bank of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.246" offset="2440338">The 34 remaining mailings and the one at issue before this Court involved the mailings of the copies of the accepted contracts in the accompanied form letters by the defendants to their victims after the advance pay had been secured by the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.870" offset="2510869">A sample of contract and form letter are set forth in the record at pages 50 and 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.038" offset="2535528">As the Court will note from the examination of the contract set forth at page 51 --</text>

            <text syncTime="624.485" offset="2601357">In many instances, yes, but as the Court will note from this financial service agreement in the record there is a space left on this contract in which the salesmen will fill out a particular fee payment schedule pertinent to each transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.713" offset="2674186">The form provides a space where the total fee is to be stated and whether arrangements made regarding installment payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.545" offset="2705533">So for example, in this contract in the record, a total fee of $900 is requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.230" offset="2728312">That was to be paid as follows, $200 on this date which was the June 11th, 1958, the date of the interview between the salesman and the prospect.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.894" offset="2770944">Then it’s provided in this particular case for a payment of $250 on or before June 20 of 1958, nine days later and the remaining $450 was to be paid when the loan is made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.540" offset="4405582">The Government suggests that an analysis of this Court’s prior decisions interpreting the mail fraud statute indicate that this particular question of statutory construction has typically been resolved on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.967" offset="4459290">We suggest that decisions of this Court have -- require first an examination of the particular fraudulent scheme set forth in the indictment, construed in light of the defrauder’s intent and purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.376" offset="4508923">And secondly, an examination of the specific mailing alleged to be for the purpose of executing the scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.829" offset="4534732">If the mailing serves in some material and substantial way to advance the fraudulent scheme then it is the suggestion of the government that that mailing under the decisions of this Court is for the purpose of executing the scheme within the meaning of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.426" offset="4593037">We do not believe that the decisions of this Court in Kann and Parr suggest any contrary analysis nor do they suggest a mechanical rule based upon the passage of money which provide the substitute for a close and particularized analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.064" offset="4659597">In the Kann case, the fraudulent scheme involved the efforts of the defendant to defraud a corporation called Triumph Explosives Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.137" offset="4695960">of which they were officers and directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.416" offset="4709021">To this end, they organized a second corporation called Elk Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.927" offset="4727097">The plan called for the diversion of illegal profits through the payment from Elk Mills to the defendants of salaries, bonuses, and dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.990" offset="4771297">As the Kann case reached this Court, two specific mailings were at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.472" offset="4797210">Both mailings involved the mailings of checks steming from two different transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.638" offset="4817899">One transaction involved the payment of a check to the defendants from a contractor in payment for timber which the defendants had falsely represented belonged to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.473" offset="4865233">The check was taken by the defendants and cashed at a local bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.662" offset="4882056">The second transaction involved the payment of a bonus payment from Elk Mills to one of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.636" offset="4909955">Again, the check was taken and deposited to the credits of one of the defendants at a local bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.069" offset="4939630">The Court held that these mailings of two checks from bank to bank were subsequent banking transactions and were incidental and collateral to the main scheme and therefore not for the purpose of executing the fraudulent scheme within the meaning of the mail fraud statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.162" offset="5003995">Since this Court’s opinion in Kann has been relied upon by both parties to this proceeding and an analysis of the language of the opinion is significant to a determination of this issue, it might be useful to quote that portion of the Kann case which the Government believes is most useful in analyzing this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1288.215" offset="5256234">Also to be distinguished are cases where the use of the mails as a means of concealment so that further fraud which are part of the scheme may be perpetrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.553" offset="5293537">Indeed, the mailing has ordinarily had a much closer relation to further fraudulent conduct that has the mere clearing of a check although, it is conceivable that this alone in some settings would be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.984" offset="5343274">The federal mail fraud statute does not purport to reach all frauds but only those limited instances in which the use of the mails as a part of the execution of the fraud leaving all other cases to be dealt with by appropriate state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1332.110" offset="5431777">As this Court knows the scheme in the Parr case involved the takeover by the defendants of a Texas School District and the misappropriation of a portion of the revenues collected by that School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.224" offset="5484231">In the Parr case, there were three specific mailings which are pertinent to the issue now before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.701" offset="5506173">These mailings related to transactions in Parr between oil companies and the defendants whereby the defendants secured goods and services from the oil companies through the illegal use of the School District’s credit card.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.732" offset="5570330">The three mailings involved, the mailing of two invoices from oil companies to the school district after the goods and services had been obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.934" offset="5607111">The third mailing involved the mailing of a check from the School District to an oil company in payment of such an invoice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.958" offset="5639189">But this Court held that those three mailings between the oil companies and the School District were not for the purpose of executing the total fraudulent scheme as required by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.656" offset="5682030">IN so holding this Court relied on the language I have quoted from Kann and emphasized that the mailings there were incidental and collateral to the main fraudulent scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.180" offset="5728110">The Government believes that there are some substantial distinctions between the Kann and the Parr cases on the one hand and this case on the other which supports the Government’s position that the mailings set forth in this indictment were for the purpose of executing this particular fraudulent scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.905" offset="5803029">In part, the Government wishes to emphasize the functions which these mailings served in relation to the individual victims or the recipients of the accepted contract and the form letters.</text>

            <text syncTime="1793.410" offset="7276962">Throughout this Court’s opinion in Kann it was stressed that what was involved was routine bank collection mailings and that there was only at stake there, the question is to whether or not the mere clearing of a check which is typified commercial practice was sufficient to invoke the federal mail fraud statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2250.798" offset="9106578">It has to be emphasized that these prospects were told of course as the Court recognizes that the moneys would be refunded in the event the contract was not accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.673" offset="9154017">And so, if the contract indicated an acceptance had not been mailed, there certainly is reason to assume that there would’ve been the complaints from the individual victims which the Government believes might well have a brought an end to this fraudulent scheme with reference to other victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.836" offset="9230712">We suggest that the Court in the Kann case did have in mind precisely this type of mailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.808" offset="9258611">The Court in Kann accepted from it’s ruling those cases where the mails were used “as a means of concealment so that further frauds which are part of the scheme can be perpetrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.945" offset="9307199">”Now, it’s clear that the scheme in Kann involved only a single victim whereas the scheme here involves a large number of victims, but there is nothing in the language of this Court or certainly in the underlying rationale which would so limit this theory to only those schemes involving single victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.032" offset="9379506">To so interpret the language or interpret the statute in the Government’s view were to be unrealistic or unrealistically fragmentized the single scheme alleging the indictment into a multitude of individual schemes with reference to individual victims.</text>

            <text syncTime="2404.571" offset="9721605">Now, we suggest the Government’s analysis of the statutes is consistent with this Court’s opinion -- opinions in Kann and Parr and in addition we believe that the analysis is supported by a large number of Courts of Appeals’ decision which are cited in the Government’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.466" offset="9785240">Many of these decisions have involved fraudulent schemes much more analogous to the scheme here at bar than the schemes in the Kann and the Parr cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.589" offset="9829752">And in such cases the Courts of Appeals have applied the statute in a way so as to support the Government’s position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.082" offset="9859741">One such case which might be useful in illustration is a case called Clark v. United States decided by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and cited at page 14 of the Government’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.528" offset="9913448">In this case, the defendant took money from the victim and represented that he would invest this moneys on the victim’s behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.282" offset="9944482">In fact, they did not invest them on the victim’s behalf, but appropriated the moneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.570" offset="9965693">Subsequently he wrote letters to the victims in which he continued the representation that the moneys had been invested on the victim’s behalf and it was these mailings which were at issue in the Clark case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.486" offset="10009266">And Judge Prettyman in Clark rejected the contention that this Court’s opinion in Kann requires that once money had passed hands the scheme terminated and then a subsequent mailing could not be for the purpose of executing the scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.710" offset="10070183">In rejecting that argument, Judge Prettyman stated, the fallacy of this argument is that the taking described in the indictment was not the bare taking of the money and its conversion to appellant’s use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.086" offset="10115741">The scheme also included a representation that the money would be invested in Mr. Dixon’s behalf with the insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.567" offset="10141654">Such a scheme obviously included an understanding at some return by way of interests or dividends would be forthcoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.662" offset="10166000">It encompassed an intention not only to convert the money but also to keep it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.117" offset="10183868">So, as to any action on the part of appellant which represented efforts on his part to continue the representation that the money was invested and efforts by him to keep the money constituted activities for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.395" offset="10244995">We think that other decisions also demonstrate the facts which are relevant in interpreting the statute as applied to this particular type of comprehensive fraudulent scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.197" offset="10284178">In any event, we stress that the mailings here contrary to Kann and Parr were between the defendant and the victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.056" offset="10311555">They were planned from the outset as an essential ingredient of the scheme to discourage the victim from recovering their money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.022" offset="10335483">They continued the representation that valuable services would be performed and they enabled the defendants to perpetrate further frauds during the course of their continued and elaborate scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.965" offset="10375189">We think the District Court erred in ignoring these factors and stressing only the point at which money changed hands and then judgment should therefore be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2592.761" offset="10474454">We would like initially to call to the Court’s attention that our brief raises three major issues with respect to this appeal but only one of which was touched by the argument of Mr. Willens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.835" offset="10538715">I will undertake to cover the argument which he covered; the portion of the issues covered by him and then proceed to the other two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.409" offset="10588975">There is of course here no question on our part but that the indictment if true and it is denied by the defendants, but if the indictment is true, charges a fraud, charges wrongful conduct by which we would not undertake to defend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.391" offset="10668910">That is not the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.824" offset="10678627">The issue here is whether the indictment charges a federal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.432" offset="10705063">I call your attention to the fact that counsel, Mr. Willens correctly states the statutory test which requires that the mailing be for the purpose of executing the scheme or artifice to defraud or obtain money by false pretenses or attempting so to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.355" offset="10796805">But in his brief, the Government quickly departs from this statutory test and the statutory language which is language of limitations and restrictions and goes to the broadest kind of language such as mailings which advanced the plan or advanced the plot, mailings as part of a long range preparations and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.962" offset="10911222">And by substituting here, this broader language for the narrower restrictive language of a statute perhaps in 1872, we feel that the Government here seeks to extend this coverage of statute in both directions to extend it in one direction, to cover mailings which are purely preliminary and to extend it in the other direction or to cover mailings which follow the execution of the offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3089.013" offset="12459447">In the Kann case, as counsel has pointed out there were two mailings of checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.134" offset="12499884">One check was received by a subsidiary of the victim corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.143" offset="12523917">It was endorsed and deposited for credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.306" offset="12544606">The other check was received from an innocent contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.002" offset="12559339">He was an innocent intermediary who gave a check to the defendants for $12,000 and was then to bill the ultimate victim for that amount of $12,000 and this other check clearly, it was most important to the defendants that there be a smooth clearance of that check because there then followed a subsequent activity which was the billing of the $12,000 to the ultimate victim whereupon the defendants would use their offices within the corporation to see that the check was paid without disturbance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.301" offset="12732583">It cannot be said here that subsequent mailings were not within their contemplation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.435" offset="12757138">It cannot be said here that subsequent mailings were not extremely important to the security of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.654" offset="12789948">In fact, it would appear that the subsequent mailings there were of much greater concern to the security of the defendants than were the subsequent mailings here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.199" offset="12856195">The dissent in that case as I understand was based upon the fact that those mailings were somewhat tentative because the burden did not fall back upon the victim until the checks had cleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.227" offset="12932263">In the case of the check from the intermediary, the contract -- it’s not -- and he indicated that the ultimate victim had in any way had sent it to the transaction and that the billing was yet to be made to the ultimate victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.555" offset="12997569">What the Court pointed out in that case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.833" offset="13010735">Well first, an issue was raised as to whether the defendants had received irrevocably the fruits of the fraud because of the tentative nature which I pointed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.536" offset="13057546">The majority held however, that once those checks were deposited and a credit was received or cash was received that the payment could not be stopped and that the fruits of the fraud had been irrevocably received.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.131" offset="13119927">And therefore, subsequent mailings were incidental, irrelevant really to the fact that a crime of fraud had been committed and the Court in its very holding pointed out, we hold therefore that one element of the offense defined by this statute namely that the mailing must be for the purpose of executing the fraud is lacking in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.140" offset="13235911">And we think that squarely covers this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.462" offset="13249181">It was alleged as is indicated in the argument set in – digested proceeding the opinion that the Government argued that this was a continuing scheme, there wasn’t any question about that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.084" offset="14115715">Well, that depends upon what statute intends to refer to when it uses the ten -- the term scheme or artifice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.654" offset="14149987">I think when it uses the term scheme that could possibly be construed to be broad or narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.436" offset="14181125">When it uses the term artifice however, I think it is indicating as the Court held in Kann that it is talking about a particular transaction of fraud and not a long range of plan of operations which may contemplate fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.990" offset="14251342">The very argument that you suggest Mr. Chief Justice was made to the Court in the Kann case and the Court replied to that that it must look at the matter in transaction by transaction, that is fraud by fraud and artifice by artifice and the question was as to whether in the execution of any fraud to obtain money by false pretenses, the crime, the offense rather, the underlying wrong and offense of obtaining the money by false pretenses, there was a use of the mails that the scheme or artifice as referred to does not extend to a long range plan of operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.316" offset="14448619">We recognize that that is the Government’s position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.297" offset="14460531">We think it is squarely contrary to Kann and is -- I only wish to say squarely contrary to Parr.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.050" offset="14491564">We -- of course, it is unnecessary to call to the Court’s attention the fact that this is a criminal statute, that it should be strictly construed even if there were some ambiguity within the statute on that, it should be decided in favor of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.906" offset="14586964">And this point, we say, has been decided by this Court on two occasions in the Kann case and again in the Parr case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.725" offset="14626252">The Parr case perhaps is even clearer, even more conclusive if that were possible on this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.369" offset="14664808">There it was charged in count 17, 18 and 19 that the accused using wrongfully a charge account of the School District of the particular District in Texas had obtained gas and oil and services from a gas station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.413" offset="14761044">Subsequent to their obtaining the gas and oil of course, the gas station billed the School District which the defendants controlled and by reason of their control they had the School District pay those checks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.095" offset="14815796">Now, of course what happened subsequent to their getting the gas and all was of great moment so far as the security of the accused, the defendants were concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="3983.152" offset="16036028">That argument was not what was accepted in Kann and that is not the exception that was made in Kann because clearly there, if the earlier transaction of fraud upon the ultimate victim, the Triumph Corporation had been revealed, the whole thing would’ve blown up and there would’ve been no fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.846" offset="16150758">Likewise in the Parr case, if one transaction were revealed, of course it would have blown up and there would have been no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.750" offset="16190360">What the Court is referring to is where one mailing contributes to the execution of a later fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="4031.646" offset="16229961">Another example of that, cited -- which is given involved in one of the cases cited by the Solicitor here is where a loan had been made from a bank putting up securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.600" offset="16309791">There was a mailing subsequent to the date of that loan, but the Court, this was Corbett versus United States, the Court made it very clear that that contributed to the inducing of the bank to make further loans upon -- for its bonds and that it was part of the effort to get further loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.171" offset="16412087">But it would not cover a situation where the concealment merely prevents arrest, arrest and leaves the defendant free to commit other frauds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.015" offset="16471437">There is no allegation in this indictment that the performance in one case had anything, any relation whatsoever to a sale in another situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.309" offset="16536639">And in fact, a reading of the full indictment would indicate that these were separate, independent and unrelated transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.287" offset="16568508">Again, I would say not nearly so closely related as in Kann and Parr where a failure to conceal one transaction would of course had terminated as to other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.166" offset="16636008">If I may proceed, I think it is interesting to note that Congress has on many occasions passed statutes with -- which deal with the matter of concealment after the execution of a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="4504.434" offset="18121122">We note that Mr. Miller, head of the Criminal Division in the Department of Justice, Assistant Attorney General Miller in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee was asked whether he wanted the 1961 anti -- antiracketeering statutes extended to include fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.815" offset="18242644">If fraud had been included then there would be no question but that any mailing in the course of unlawful -- in the course of a business having as its objective fraud would be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4549.037" offset="18299486">But he expressly declined that and I think Mr. Chief Justice that he declined there to accept the jurisdiction which your question would tend to give it here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4595.053" offset="18483597">He said that this would be a major expansion or a jurisdiction which would burden both on the prosecuting and on investigative staffs and we feel that the Government is seeking here through this indictment and under a restrictive statute which this Court has held to be limited and restricted is seeking to get the jurisdiction of that it declined there.</text>

            <text syncTime="5453.300" offset="21916609">Mr. Chief Justice, I just like to take a moment to correct a misunderstanding that I may have caused in response to a question from Mr. Justice Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="5465.640" offset="21965928">You asked whether or not the mailings might be linked together in a single count in the Government’s indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5472.168" offset="21992051">And under the present state of the law which is that these mailings constitutes an offense such adjoining of more than one individual mailing would be the [Inaudible].</text>
            <text syncTime="5480.241" offset="22024338">Under the present law it would be a closer question perhaps if more than one letter were mailed at the same time and in some way could be identified with each other under the present state of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5492.280" offset="22072508">The Government did not address itself to the conspiracy count dismissal for several reasons and I’d like to just mention now to the Court that the arguments raised by the appellees here may not really be appropriately before this Court under the jurisdiction of Criminal Appeals Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5514.351" offset="22160802">In effect the District Court’s dismissal of the conspiracy count could not have been based upon the District Court’s rationale that every count in this indictment was in fact a conspiracy count because as counsel for appellees has indicated said, precisely such a motion was made below in the District Court and it was denied by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5535.990" offset="22247320">And it’s clear under the criminal appeals act that an appeal by the Government is strictly limited and does not open up the entire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5544.826" offset="22282637">In any event we believe there’s no merit to this contention because the Pereira and Pinkerton cases stand for the clear proposition that a conspiracy can be linked with substantive counts.</text>

            <text syncTime="5556.481" offset="22329344">Well, does your (Inaudible) -- is it your contention that the substantive counts for themselves conspiracies, or do you deny that?</text>

            <text syncTime="5563.922" offset="22359019">We really grant that there's a similarity in substantive mail fraud counts with conspiracy counts but we don’t think that the similarity is particularly relevant to the issue now before this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="5575.622" offset="22405831">Well, it’s -- you mean, it isn’t relevant at all as to whether or not you can have an additional conspiracy count?</text>

            <text syncTime="5581.200" offset="22428191">No, we think the conspiracy count was improperly been dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5584.580" offset="22441671">We think the Pereira case was clear on this point, a conspiracy to use the mails to defraud was a link with a substantive mail fraud count and in the count sustained such adjoining over the objections similar to those being raised here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.520" offset="22497468">So, we think it’s clear that you -- the Government can join a conspiracy to use the mails to defraud for substantive counts under the mail fraud statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5607.911" offset="22534980">And as to any prejudice which may have result to the salesman or any participants in a scheme or artifice we think these are matters for -- of proof and can -- any problems of prejudice can be certainly fairly resolved by the District Court in the exercise of his sound discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5625.599" offset="22605720">I would like to mention also that the appellees have stressed continually the offense of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.744" offset="22634350">The mail fraud statute is not so drafted, it’s a scheme or artifice to defraud and this Court for many years has emphasized that the statute is not to be limited by particular state definitions of the criminal offense of the fraud or false pretenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5650.161" offset="22704044">As long ago as 1896 in the Durland case, this Court rejected precisely such a contention to the effect that the mail fraud statute encompassed only the common law offense of false pretenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5663.059" offset="22755558">This Court held to the contrary instead the mail fraud statute was passed to prevent all intentional efforts to despoil and the use of the post office in affecting that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5673.382" offset="22796936">We believe that therefore the offense stated here is within the statute and that the mails were used for executing the fraudulent scheme.</text>
