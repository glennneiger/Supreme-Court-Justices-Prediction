            <label>Mr. L. N. D. Wells, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="31.402" offset="229021">Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.285" offset="244485">Texas Courts have awarded actual and punitive damages to a union member named Borden.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.450" offset="281161">For as the Texas Court says, “Refusal to refer him to a job offered him in the construction of the Republic Bank Building in Dallas”, we're here on certiorari challenging the Texas State jurisdiction and asserting that the conduct refusal to refer is subject to the exclusive federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.119" offset="387845">We're quite close to the case which precedes this, except we don't have the supervisory problem in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.426" offset="425044">Briefly, the facts, Borden was a member of the Plumber's Union who lived in Shreveport.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.575" offset="457644">Construction workers are ambulatory, he's all over every place, building.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.532" offset="481468">He worked for Farwell Construction Company down in Galveston and on a big hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.927" offset="503097">This job was about to conclude and he learned down there in Galveston that this large job was coming in Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.053" offset="535594">He quit in Galveston and went home to Shreveport and as he said went fishing for two to three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.218" offset="564224">And then in September, came over to Dallas, as he said to go to work on the Republic Bank job, which was the biggest job in Dallas at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.750" offset="606333">He said that it was a good job and I like to work on big work.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.650" offset="622007">It was a big job and I wanted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.963" offset="635173">So he went to the supervisor for Farwell who was the mechanical contractor on the Republic Bank, and was told that he would be employed if he obtained a union referral.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.025" offset="695463">He then came back to the Dallas local union hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.703" offset="714167">He had not obtained a clearance card from his Shreveport local, but he did have his international union due book with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.187" offset="752097">He went to the Dallas local and told the business agent, Lanham, “I'm here to go to work on the Republic Bank Building.”</text>
            <text syncTime="171.569" offset="789608">As Borden testified, Lanham “blow his top” and said, “You're not going to work on that bank building.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.429" offset="825135">You've come in here wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.805" offset="834644">You've come in here with a job in your pocket.”</text>
            <text syncTime="186.218" offset="848227">Now, if I may digress briefly here, there was a contract in effect in Dallas between this local union and the Mechanical Contractors Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.942" offset="891173">Farwell was a member of that Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.064" offset="903607">It is an abbreviated contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.127" offset="911862">It's in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.866" offset="914787">It provides wage rates and grievance procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.116" offset="927848">It does not, in so many words, provide for a hiring hall, but it is undisputed in this record that it is the custom in Dallas for all the mechanical contractors and certainly -- well, perhaps I'm overstating the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.504" offset="985422">It is the -- it is clear that Farwell hired only through the union hiring hall as a matter of custom.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.389" offset="1024920">Now, when Lanham, the business agent, tells Borden, the man coming in from Shreveport, “You've come in here wrong; you've come in with the job in your pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.774" offset="1054490">I'm not going to refer you.”</text>
            <text syncTime="241.091" offset="1067760">Apparently, he, Lanham was referring to a local union rule which said that members shall not solicit work from any contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.103" offset="1103809">All the employment must be procured through the business office of the local.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.455" offset="1125230">This is very much likely a rule which was written into the collective bargaining contract in the Teamsters Seattle-Los Angeles case which Mr. Justice Douglas wrote.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.191" offset="1164100">And it's not an unusual provision for a building trade union to require that members seek their employment through the hiring hall rather than directly from employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.544" offset="1217599">In any event, Borden was unable to get the referral to the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.567" offset="1245602">He returned to Shreveport, obtained a clearance card from his Shreveport local union.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.199" offset="1272142">And then came back to Dallas and deposited his clearance card in the Dallas local.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.670" offset="1298056">Under the international constitution, that made him a member of the Dallas local.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.696" offset="1322193">His card was not accepted very graciously.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.363" offset="1336822">The business representative, Lanham said that, “I'll accept it.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.278" offset="1352495">I have to under the Constitution, but that don't mean you're going to work by any means.”</text>
            <text syncTime="317.332" offset="1372662">He did, however, accept the clearance card.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.331" offset="1388648">Now, if I may backtrack for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.678" offset="1398053">I indicated earlier that Borden has been working down in Galveston on a big hospital job down there several months earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.756" offset="1426369">Down there, he became friendly with a man named Thurman who was a rank-and-file employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.057" offset="1455626">By the time he gets up to Dallas, Thurman is the foreman and the hiring agent for Farwell.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.205" offset="1484152">So, Borden goes to his friend Thurman who is hiring on the Republic Bank job and says, “Call for me”, and Thurman says, “Yes, I have a job for you, but you'll need a referral.”</text>
            <text syncTime="359.927" offset="1543084">Thurman then called Lanham, the business agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.257" offset="1552384">This is the foreman calling Lanham, the business agent, and asked him to refer Borden now, and rather profanely, Mr. Lanham said, “I'm not about to send that old so and so down to the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.336" offset="1616750">He shoved his card down our throat.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.972" offset="1623228">I'm not about to send him out to the bank.”</text>
            <text syncTime="383.543" offset="1637543">Now, several days later, precise dates are difficult in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.649" offset="1653948">It was tried about six or seven years after the operating events and recollection on neither side were too good, but I won't dispute what my adversary says with respect to four or five days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.400" offset="1716955">Borden did obtain a referral first of the Spencer Plumbing Company job where he worked until -- from September until almost Christmas, until December 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.389" offset="1756975">He was laid off there when they got cut off on that job.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.603" offset="1769827">Early in January, he was referred to keep or a plumbing job and stayed there until March or April and was laid off there.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.501" offset="1797413">He was off for only a week or two and which he referred to the Rose Plumbing Company and without going into detail he was referred then to the Texas Plumbing Company and to the Dallas School Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.639" offset="1837955">So for the year, from the time he first came to Dallas, the jury found that he would have made approximately -- what is this?</text>
            <text syncTime="442.886" offset="1874944">$6000 as I recall, approximately $6000 had he been referred to the Republic Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.889" offset="1914964">But that in the interim employment to which he was referred, he made some $1900 less than he would have made, had he gone to the job which he preferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.381" offset="1960939">Now, Borden didn't ever attend a union meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.548" offset="1977553">He waited for a year although he was from time to time complaining to the business agent, but as far as coming into the local union and making any complaint or going before any tribunal before which he might have gone, he waited for a year before he did anything or perhaps 10 or 11 months rather than a complete year, and hired a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.267" offset="2068459">Well now, of course, when he waited for a year, he got way past the six-month limitation period which is in Section 10 (b) of the Federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.756" offset="2102418">He was foreclosed under the Federal Act because Congress had determined in the Federal Act that these disputes ought to be determined properly when recollections are fresh and when -- there can come some remedy promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.660" offset="2149961">He waited and then hired him a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.607" offset="2161768">The lawyer wrote the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.431" offset="2169083">The Local Union Executive Board held a hearing and this is 11 months after -- perhaps, 12 months after the time he first came to Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.954" offset="2215163">Called Borden and Lanham and the various people involved before the Local Union Executive Board and Borden testified that at that point, members of the Executive Board cursed him and abused him, and that he suffered mental diff -- or that there was mental suffering by reason of the abuse which was heaped on him a year after the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.556" offset="2313592">Now, on these facts, he brought his suit alleging that he was refused appearance into the local.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.761" offset="2346402">Now that is a membership right that he -- that the Board couldn't do anything about.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.464" offset="2373256">And alleging number two that there was a refusal of referral to a job, and that is something that the Board can and does something about everyday.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.756" offset="2414425">The case went off on the pleadings originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.074" offset="2423620">We filed a plea to the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.236" offset="2432293">There was a finding in the State District Court that it was a matter of federal and not state concern, and it was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.519" offset="2461445">Borden appealed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.134" offset="2467924">The Dallas Court of Civil Appeals affirmed the dismissal, but while it was pending on rehearing, Gonzales came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.502" offset="2497390">And this was properly called to the Texas Court's opinion -- attention and they reconsidered and held that it was a state matter and there was state jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.143" offset="2547963">Then there was an appeal to the Supreme Court of Texas which does not treat of the federal preemption issue at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.145" offset="2575966">It treats of other matters in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.619" offset="2589863">And in a lengthy opinion, the Texas Supreme Court came to the nub of what the case was about under Texas law, that it said that the allegations that Borden willfully was denied a job to which he was entitled under the rules and procedures established by the union for allocating work entitled him to maintain this suit, and remanded for a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.105" offset="2711803">Now, we have a special issue practice in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.916" offset="2723088">No general verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.611" offset="2729775">The jury answered specific questions as to what had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.003" offset="2743359">The jury found that he had been promised of a job on the bank if he got a referral.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.987" offset="2767287">That the foreman called for him -- called the union to give him a referral and the union wouldn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.024" offset="2791424">The jury found that he was not refused clearance into the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.448" offset="2809187">And in our view, that takes this membership right, individual versus union, out of the case by this favorable finding to us on that aspect of the case, but did found that he was refused a referral and that he had been damaged in the amount of approximately $1900.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.928" offset="2891107">Now, what was the damage that they found?</text>
            <text syncTime="699.190" offset="2900093">What was the measure?</text>
            <text syncTime="700.981" offset="2907303">He -- the damage he would have earned if he had been allowed to work on the Republic Bank, exactly the same back pay that the Board could have given under the Federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.293" offset="2952547">Now, counsel through his briefs has indicated that there's malice and there's some kind of general tort idea and there are other wrongs involved, but we take that he's bound by what he presented to the jury and what the jury found.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.063" offset="3003643">And the only damage they found was the damage that is squarely within the federal remedy and the very matter that the Board would look to.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.528" offset="3045439">In addition, the jury found $1500 worth of mental anguish and $5000 worth of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.193" offset="3080129">So we, under the verdict, had $1900 of actual damage for the difference between what he has made at Republic and elsewhere, $1500 for mental anguish, and $5000 for punitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.138" offset="3131956">There were post trial motions and the trial court found that mental anguish was not raised by the law in the evidence and should not have been submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.670" offset="3174066">We take it that this is a trial court finding that much of what is in our opponent's brief about ugly talk by the Executive Board or ugly talk by a union business agent is clearly out of the case because the trial court found in his judgment that it was not raised for the evidence and should not have been submitted as an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.788" offset="3254523">So, the trial court then reduced the punitive damage to the equal of the actual damage and entered a judgment against us for double what the Labor Board would have given, had the matter been before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.077" offset="3319724">I emphasize there was no damage for the cursing, no damages for refusal to clear in to the union, and the sole damage was with respect to the refusal to refer to this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.143" offset="3367894">Now, on the basis of that --</text>

            <text syncTime="1477.544" offset="6013576">Then drawing your attention to the special issue number five, the Court inquired as to whether the action taken against Borden was done willfully to which the jury answered yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.743" offset="6066343">It was on this foundation that the Court based the finding of exemplary damage, the intentional disregard of the known rights of another.</text>

            <text syncTime="1522.190" offset="6192149">The legal remedy to which Judge Black -- Justice Black, I think referred, applies in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.559" offset="6237602">Now, to begin with, Mr. Borden was a member of both the Local Union 100 and the United Association at the time of this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.179" offset="6296116">Local 100 in Dallas is a member of the parent organization, United Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.855" offset="6326836">Suit was originally brought against both, the parent and the local union.Conspiracy was charged against both unions in breach of contract against Mr. Borden as well as the Commission of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.005" offset="6391411">Later on, during the progress of the trial, the United Association, on motion by the Court, was dismissed from the action and is no longer in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.326" offset="6436655">I thought I'd bring that to the Court's attention this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.839" offset="6458702">Now, Mr. Borden did work in Galveston for the Farwell Construction Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.927" offset="6495065">He was a member of a local union in Galveston which is also a member of the United Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.659" offset="6529964">After leaving Galveston, he did come to Dallas to attempt to get a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.686" offset="6554102">Now, in the United Association, if a man has a dues book, he may automatically become a member of that particular local union even without a clearance card.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.036" offset="6615542">If he has a clearance card from his previous local union, he may also become a member of the new local union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.878" offset="6650859">Or failing to have either of these indicia of membership, he may deposit $10 as an evidence of good faith, and then maybe referred out on the job as any other member of the local union.And it is the union's responsibility to obtain his clearance card.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.397" offset="6724942">Mr. Borden arrived in Dallas around September the 15th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.183" offset="6744064">He called to Farwell Construction Company job and talked to Mr. Heave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.858" offset="6766843">After he talked to Mr. Heave, there's nothing in the record as to what was said between the two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.344" offset="6788786">After he talked to Mr. Heave, he went to the local union, to Lanham who was a businessman, who had the duty as found by the jury, and as it is shown in the constitution and bylaws of the local union to refer the man out on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.943" offset="6855137">He asked Mr. Lanham for a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.637" offset="6865899">He asked specifically to be referred to the Republic Bank job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.397" offset="6884916">Mr. Lanham refused, he cursed him, he said he come in here wrong, he came in with the job in his pocket, he wasn't going to send him out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.960" offset="6919189">He refused to accept his clearance card.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.475" offset="6929324">Now, we're not basing our action on his union membership rights on whether or not they accepted the clearance card this time contrary to what Mr. Wells has said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.918" offset="6979062">Because later on and we have admitted in our pleadings and it is in evidence, they did accept the clearance card after he had gone back to Shreveport at a later date and picked up the clearance card.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.897" offset="7026918">That first time he only had the dues book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.003" offset="7039352">After he had gone back and picked up his clearance card and brought it back, he finally did find Lanham and did give it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.335" offset="7072684">Now, it took him about six days during his entire period of time in order to merely be enrolled as member, but that is not the real issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.933" offset="7119078">Now, after he had come back to Dallas the second time with what he called the boss, the clearance card, he presented that to Lanham and said he wanted to go to work on the Republic Bank job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.855" offset="7166830">And in the meantime, he had talked to Mr. Thurman who was not the sole hiring agent on the job but was a superintendent on the job and did have the authority, as the jury found, to hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.079" offset="7231718">He asked Mr. Thurman to place a call for him with the local union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.016" offset="7259408">Mr. Thurman testified that he did do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.778" offset="7274454">Mr. Borden went to the union and this time, he was told or Mr. Thurman was told that they would not refer Mr. Borden for the job because he had shoved his clearance card down their throats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.301" offset="7336626">In any event, Mr. Borden didn't get the job and he was referred down on several other jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.651" offset="7365987">Now, the jury has found, one, that Mr. Borden had a job opportunity offered to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.581" offset="7417710">They found that Mr. Lanham had the duty under the rules and procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.444" offset="7445191">He had a duty under the rules and procedures, a contract prior to Mr. Borden's to refer Mr. Borden for the job, and that he willfully violated that duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.946" offset="7495137">And it's on this basis that the Court awarded both the actual and the exemplary damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.561" offset="7521573">Now, in answer to one question from the Court as to why the judge reduced the exemplary damages from $5000, as awarded by the jury, to $1916 which is the exact amount of the actual damages, I can only answer -- I don't know except that I think that he thought that he could not award exemplary damages in any amount greater than actual damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.083" offset="7631705">We contested in the Appeals Court but you must prove a gross abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in ordering remittitur and this finding of the Court was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.545" offset="7685517">Also, we contested in the Appeals Court the disallowance by the trial court on his own motion of the $1500 mental pain and suffering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.278" offset="7740479">This also was disallowed by the appellate -- Appeals Court on the grounds once again, we must have proof gross abuse of discretion which is almost impossible to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.001" offset="7799411">Now, the testimony shows that Mr. Borden was cursed, he was abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.355" offset="7824802">He was kicked from teller to post.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.870" offset="7834833">It also shows that he went to an executive board meeting, and there in this meeting, they told Mr. Borden that if he didn't like the action that the union was taken against him that they could take away his clearance card, they could take away his union membership, kick him out of the union, and kick him out of Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.556" offset="7913618">And that the best thing he could do would be to forget the whole matter and leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.862" offset="7934830">Now, Mr. Borden testified that after this meeting, that he was in fear of bodily harm and he made himself scarce around the union hall except when he had to go there to pay dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.760" offset="7982373">Now, I imagine he was pretty careful about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.057" offset="7999613">Now, this action is not based in anyway on the Labor Management Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.610" offset="8033782">There are no pleadings by Borden that the union violated any provision of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.316" offset="8060635">No contention has ever been made that the Act in anyway is involved in this case insofar as Mr. Borden's concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.985" offset="8099297">The Supreme Court of State of Texas as Mr. Wells has already alluded to did get to the nub of this case in the first appeal when it said on page 34 of the record, “According to the petition, it was Lanham's duty to place the members of the union with their various job opportunities, a duty that he had, a contract action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.046" offset="8215594">This is also shown in the opinion of the Court of Civil Appeals from which the appeal has been taken to this Court where the Court stated, “The suit of Borden as already stated was based on both contract and tort.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.558" offset="8305560">This is on page 350 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.351" offset="8320815">No special issue was submitted to the jury in anyway based on the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.377" offset="8348923">The special issues submitted were solely based upon duties owed to Mr. Borden by Lanham and by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.922" offset="8387062">Special issue number 6 inquired as to whether Lanham breached his duty to Borden under the rules and procedures of Local 100.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.420" offset="8433037">The jury answered, “Yes”, failing to receive an affirmative answer on this particular special issue, our case would have followed and Mr. Borden would not have received relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.114" offset="8483819">Unless we approved the contract, unless we approved the deal on Lanham, the business manager, there would have been no action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.335" offset="8524675">There is no special issue in anyway related to any duties owed under the Taft-Hartley Act only under the rules and procedures of the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="2712.489" offset="10953331">And back to what Justice Black asked awhile ago, in that situation, the Court found that by discharging the man pursuant to the union request have found that the motive of the employer was to encourage union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.587" offset="11045700">In the case of Local 357, which was a hiring all case, NLRB versus Local 357, the majority of this Court, some affirmative showing of motivation of encouragement or discouragement must be shown that it is the true purpose and the real motive of the employer in refusing to hire which is at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.800" offset="11154578">The concurring opinion said that it was the forbidden motivation which must be examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.387" offset="11184880">The certified bargaining agent has the duty to represent all the employees' fair and that all business purposes are not bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.320" offset="11224691">Now, the only thing shown in this record is that Mr. Borden was told to go to the union and get a referral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.365" offset="11260844">Now, there's nothing in the record showing that Mr. Borden ever went back and tried to get a job after he had been referred to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.708" offset="11298252">There is no showing of that, that there was any agreement whatsoever between the Farwell Construction Company and the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.746" offset="11334405">That they would only hire men referred to them by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.259" offset="11348407">And in fact in Texas, we have the right to work law and it would've been illegal anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.139" offset="11371917">So, there is no motivation shown here by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.899" offset="11402951">The union claims in its brief that the record is insufficient in regard to hiring arrangements between Farwell and the union and I say that since this was the duty, since this was the issue raised by the union, that they had the burden of going forward to show that this was an action which should have been considered by the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.448" offset="11517158">The union cannot raise on one hand as an issue that this is preempted by the Act and hide behind the skirts without going further and showing in what manner it does come within the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.061" offset="11579643">They went -- they did not go forward where they act at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.971" offset="11607228">Now, next, we say that even though, even though it'd be considered that there was a violation of the Act in this case, not admitting but assuming that it be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.469" offset="11669295">Nonetheless, the Texas state courts had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.600" offset="11685804">The state courts have the right as found by the Court in Gonzales to vindicate the personal rights of an individual on the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.045" offset="11727600">Now, that is exactly what this case involves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.703" offset="11742229">The constitution and bylaw of Section 30 of the union constitution, says, that a man will not take a job without a referral from the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.521" offset="11789458">To do so, we'll place him in the position where he may be expelled from the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2928.258" offset="11816417">Mr. Borden shows not to, after having been a member of the union for 22 years, place his retirement and pension that he had obtained in the union on the block to lose all of his union rights and go ahead and go back to the employer and ask for the job anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.071" offset="11899695">We have pleaded in paragraph 15 specifically that this was a violation of the union constitution and bylaws, and this was found by the jury in answer to the special issue number six.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.921" offset="11955075">The Appeals Courts have treated this as a violation of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.745" offset="11982346">Texas courts have long recognized and --</text>

            <text syncTime="2982.449" offset="12033128">The court in that case, the second Garmon, recognized the validity of the Gonzales case that in situations where a matter is of peripheral concern to the Act, nonetheless, the state courts may have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.974" offset="12111287">Now, this assumed that it may also be a violation of the Act, but that it is a fair amount of right for the State to go ahead and take consideration of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.912" offset="12163009">Now, I think the Garmon case goes back to Weber and Garner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.060" offset="12183594">The Court in the Garmon case clearly considered that this was a violation of 8 (b) (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.935" offset="12211075">In fact, they found in the first instance that it was a violation of the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.346" offset="12240750">I think that this case does follow clearly within Gonzales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.874" offset="12266872">As I said before, you might pick out a violation of the Act in this case, but nonetheless --</text>

            <text syncTime="3047.686" offset="12294144">That's what Garmon says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.936" offset="12299160">It was arguably.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.629" offset="12305847">I didn't agree with Garmon but I'm bound with it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Weldon Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="3053.731" offset="12318281">Well, I think the Court has gone further and said that it's not only arguably but it -- that it is reasonably arguable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.857" offset="12342836">In the Interlake case, the Court used the word reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.157" offset="12356002">I don't think that the Court meant that ingenuity of counsel is paramount in saying whether or not a case should go before the NLRB.It has to be of reasonable argument, surely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.776" offset="12410441">And what I'd like to point out further is that the proviso to Section 8 (b) (2) or 8 (b) (1) as congressional history in 93 Congressional Record, page 440 where Senator Ball stated that it was never the intention of the sponsors of the pending amendment, that is the proviso, to interfere with the internal affairs of organizations of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.693" offset="12550144">Now, this does not refer clearly to whether a man has been expelled from the union or whether he's been denied membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.255" offset="12580342">This goes to all of the internal affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.665" offset="12594030">Senator Taft said the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.178" offset="12604061">He said that, “Although the union may be wrong and that under the Act, the man must be reemployed by an employer, nonetheless, regardless of whether the man did a rightful act or wrongful act, the union can discharge him from membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.384" offset="12672920">And that the Act does not cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.845" offset="12678771">Now, that's what this case is based upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.948" offset="12691205">This man had rights within the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.713" offset="12702177">What is the difference if a man is expelled from the union, if he is suspended from the union, or if he's merely kept within the union but denied on union rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.517" offset="12745435">And that's what happened in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.465" offset="12757243">If you say that a man must be expelled from the union first before he may take action, then will not the union just keep the man a membership but deny him all of the rights?</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.667" offset="12802069">It would seem likely that that would be exactly the result of the fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.445" offset="12857135">Now, I do not think also that the holding in Gonzales should be limited only to contract actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.757" offset="12914395">I think that the Court in that instance was talking of matters of peripheral concern in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.346" offset="12948773">Now, surely, where there is a picketing activity whether it's a matter -- I thank the Court.</text>
