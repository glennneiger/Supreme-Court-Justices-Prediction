            <label>Mr. B. D. Murphy</label>
            <text syncTime="22.799" offset="194539">Yes, Your Honor, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.342" offset="216691">This is an appeal from a decision by a three-judge District Court which held unconstitutional Georgia's statute describing the county unit system of nominating a party of candidates for state offices and enjoining the party of authorities against holding the primary of 1962 or any primary under a county unit system.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.694" offset="370186">The history of the county unit system of Georgia is set forth to some extent in the opinion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.749" offset="422327">The law is also stated to some extent in the briefs of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.705" offset="450226">It may be worthwhile for me to state it here as briefly as I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.925" offset="491081">Georgia, of course, is one of the original 13 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.966" offset="515218">When it became a state, it consisted mainly in a few certain areas along the Atlantic coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.411" offset="553044">I've forgotten how many counties we had at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.346" offset="564746">Well, I think it was six or seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.407" offset="585017">The state officers were elected by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.625" offset="613857">The Constitution assigned certain num -- a certain number of representatives to each county.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.710" offset="642173">I think Liberty County had 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.930" offset="655130">Some of the other counties had two, some had four.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.560" offset="673625">The town in Port of Savannah had two that represent that trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.295" offset="704554">The town in Port of Sunbury had two to represent that trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.537" offset="721481">That was the legislative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.513" offset="737468">As I say, the legislative body elected the county -- the state officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.816" offset="754604">We had no election of governor by the people until 1823.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.543" offset="785533">Early in the history of the state -- the political history of the state, the county's unit system of nominations developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.945" offset="823150">It started by caucuses in the legislature, members of the legislature who belong to the Democratic Party would get together and nominate their candidate for governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.090" offset="883754">In the same manner, the members of the Whig Party and the legislature would get together and nominate the Whig candidate for governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.496" offset="921370">Gradually, they began to invite to those caucuses members of the party from counties that were represented in legislature by the opposite party.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.637" offset="977899">The Whig members would invite democrats from -- or invite Whigs from counties who didn't have Whig representatives and the democrats would do the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.159" offset="1023979">Our convention system of nomination grew out of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.375" offset="1040906">We never had any direct primaries in Georgia until about 1890 and I think the direct primaries in Georgia grew out of the probably the strength of what was then known as the Populist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.900" offset="1106944">The final election of the officers for the state had been -- have always, since election by the people was inaugurated about 1823 by a majority vote of all the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.694" offset="1170160">The legislature meets and canvasses the vote and declares the person having the majority of all the votes to be the governor or the state -- Secretary of the State as the case may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.092" offset="1231705">And, if nobody is elected, they have a -- the legislature proceeds to elect a governor from the -- either the two or three highest.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.475" offset="1281233">We had a situation of that sort in 1946 when the governor-elect died before the time came to inaugurate and the legislature elected from some write-in candidates, and the Supreme Court held they couldn't do that and if the old governor continued to hold office and he hadn't resigned, the lieutenant governor-elect was to be the governor until there could be an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.956" offset="1383215">That, of course, has nothing to do with this particular question.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.718" offset="1398262">But I say, the county unit system developed in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.322" offset="1416652">Finally, they began to have direct primaries for the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.186" offset="1432116">They first began to have primaries for the election of delegates to the conventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.596" offset="1457716">Then, they began to have -- some of the delegates were elected by mass meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.974" offset="1479241">Your Honors will find a complete history of the county unit system in the report of the case of Turman against Duckworth in the 68 F.Supp. 744 which was the first county unit lawsuit we had.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.153" offset="1551966">The practice was entirely a party practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.708" offset="1574222">There was never any law on the subject and the convention was the final nominating authority until the adoption of the Neill Primary Act of 1917.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.834" offset="1646738">Prior to that time, delegates were, although committed to the man who -- candidate who carried their county, did not always vote in a conformity without amendment and frequently there were convention fights.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.257" offset="1720404">The one which produced the Neill Primary Act, so-called, was in 1914 when there were three candidates for the United States Senate and neither of them had a majority of the county unit votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.509" offset="1773380">And, that was a convention contest which lasted a number of days and was finally resulted in a nomination of Senator Thomas W. Hardwick who was not the leading candidate in the vote of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.316" offset="1840671">The legislature passed the Neill Primary Act in 1916.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.232" offset="1868257">Incidentally, it's named for Cecil Neill who was the Speaker of the House of Representative of Georgia at that time and who came from one of the city counties, Muscogee.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.713" offset="1914232">Well, it was vetoed by Governor Harris, who was then governor of Georgia and who also came from one of the city counties, Bibb.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.934" offset="1947146">It was reenacted in 1916 and near 1917, and it was then approved by the new governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.820" offset="1986644">The Neill Primary Act made no substantial change in the nominating process.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.486" offset="2013288">It does not require primaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.558" offset="2021648">It never has required primaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.444" offset="2037112">It does not abolish conventions, but it provides that whenever a dem -- a political party has a primary, the person -- the candidate for any office who carries -- gets the most votes in the county, it's in plurality of votes and it's still a plurality not a majority, is entitled to the unit votes of that county on the county unit basis and that the candidate who gets the majority of all of the county unit votes is entitled to the nomination, and that can be ascertained and declared without a formal convention vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.039" offset="2223522">Incidentally, in some years when there's another -- it's not the year the elected governor don't even have a convention in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.742" offset="2254346">The Democratic Party does.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.190" offset="2268139">Always in the convention, the Democratic Party and the Democratic Conventions -- so far as I know, the Republican parties never had one in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.451" offset="2317145">Always in the Democratic Conventions, each county is entitled to two votes for each member in the Lower House of the General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.542" offset="2361553">Georgia has, now, 159 candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.787" offset="2382555">It had a 137 in 1877 when the Constitution of 1877 was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.477" offset="2425292">The -- it has what is called a 3-2-1 ratio of legislative representation in the House of Representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.988" offset="2467297">The eight largest counties have three representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.616" offset="2481821">The next 30 have 2 and the rest have 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.127" offset="2503868">As I say always, in the convention and in computing the nominating units on the county unit system, the counties have had two votes -- each county has two votes for each member of the House of Representatives to which the county is entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.840" offset="2574712">That is -- that was the party practice before the Neill Primary Act was enacted and it has been the party practice and the provision of the Neill Primary Act since that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.596" offset="2753808">I just want to be sure in my -- so I can understand the argument as we go on that we're not -- that there's not involved here legislative apportionment as such at all for your state legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="674.039" offset="2799574">The apportionment as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.502" offset="2813367">Now, I say, in 1877, we had 137 counties in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.180" offset="2840116">We may have too many but they all created by the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.344" offset="2864776">And, that Constitution provided there should be no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.125" offset="2891839">In 1903 or 1904, they amended the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.134" offset="2903960">The legislature amended it and proposed it to the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.710" offset="2914200">The people ratified it to add -- bring the number of counties up to 145, and enough additional counties were created to bring the number of counties up to 145.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.140" offset="2967907">It has not always been the eight highest with the three representatives but that's the way it is now and was cite one time, it was 6, and 26 in one.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.964" offset="3007195">And, the -- since that time, a number of counties had been three which brought the total, at one time, up to 161.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.572" offset="3061635">Each one of those counties was created by separate constitutional amendment proposed by the General Assembly and ratified by the people at the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.276" offset="3112521">Sometime ago -- some years ago, two of the counties have been created many years before were merged with Fulton County.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.266" offset="3152436">Those were Camilla and Milton, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.032" offset="3163512">So, now, we have 159 counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.465" offset="3189217">The Neill Primary Act, that I said a moment ago, didn't changed the county unit system as it had been followed by the party up until that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.850" offset="3230804">It did provide that the convention couldn't change the result of the primary as respects to right of a candidate who got the most votes in a particular county to the vote of that county on the unit basis and provided that nobody was part of the majority of the county unit votes for governor or United States Senate, that should be a run-over primary between the two highest candidates for those two officers alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.545" offset="3345533">And all the other state officers, the candidate with the most county unit votes, the plurality county votes was to be the nominee.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.946" offset="3399137">The can -- the Neill Primary Act does not apply to the congressional district primaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.149" offset="3431946">It leaves to the determination of the congressional committee or to the executive committee of the party in the district, whether or not it will have a primary on a popular vote basis or on a county unit basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.471" offset="3501223">But, if it is held on a county unit basis, then the unit votes to which the county -- which each county would be the entitled would be the same as fixed in the Neill Primary Act, that is two for each representative in the Lower House in the General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.965" offset="3583248">In 1946, the first suit challenging the validity of the Georgia county unit system was filed in a three-judge court in the Northern District of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.431" offset="3661093">That was filed by Mr. -- Mrs. Turman against the Chairman of the State Democratic Executive Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.077" offset="3695679">There was a companion case filed by Cook, a man named Cook, against the Secretary of State which related to the Fifth Congressional District of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.797" offset="3750536">It so happen that in 1946, the governor of the c -- the democratic candidate for governor who received the highest number of unit -- the majority of unit votes did not receive the highest number of popular votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.838" offset="3814693">He didn't -- there were two candidates and the man who got the highest number of unit -- majority of unit votes was the second in popular vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.914" offset="3851055">And, that brought about the case of Turman against Duckworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.559" offset="3865579">That was heard before a three-judge court and the three-judge court have decided against the plaintiffs there and it was appealed to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.376" offset="3912913">The appeal here was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.463" offset="3925243">I don't want to take to go into whether or not this Court dismissed the appeal because they were moot or for any other reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.993" offset="3955336">The record shows what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.227" offset="3976234">That was shortly after the decision of this Court in the case of Colegrove versus Green from Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.530" offset="4021478">In 1915, there was another suit brought in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia by a Mr. South and his associate whose name I've forgotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.077" offset="4099636">That was the case of South versus Peters, Mr. Peters being then challenged in the State Democratic Executive Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.150" offset="4131924">That was tried before a three-judge court composed of Judge Sibley, Judge Andrews, and Judge Hope.</text>

            <text syncTime="1314.222" offset="5360306">It was actually an extraordinary session at the time of the hearing in the court below in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1336.010" offset="5447450">I'm not sure whether judgment was entered on that day or the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.200" offset="5472214">The governor approved a statute which amended the Neill Primary Act and these respects, I said a little while ago we have 159 counties in Georgia, and the new Act allocated unit votes to the various counties in accordance with the bracket system that's set forth in the Act and is in the, I think, in the briefs and is also in the opinion of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.016" offset="5611395">No longer was the number of votes of the county -- number of unit votes to which the county was entitled based twice than the number of the representatives in the lower House to give us in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.096" offset="5683806">The Act provides, new armies will have it, that all counties with the population of less than 15,000 shall have 2 unit votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.752" offset="5730408">Counties with a population between 15 and 20 or 25, I'm not sure which, will have 3 and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.495" offset="5765308">Finally, it gets up to a bracket where they allocate additional votes at the rate of 2 for each 15,000 additional population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.961" offset="5803238">Under the county unit system, as it was enacted by that statute, Fulton County which had 6 unit votes under the old system and now has 40.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.453" offset="5861230">No county has less than two, however small the population may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.277" offset="5896443">The Court of -- the three-judge court held that this new -- that the Neill Primary Act, as amended by the Act of 1962, was unconstitutional because it was invidiously discriminatory against people who lived in -- against the plaintiff and others similarly situated, if they have been a resident of Fulton County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.762" offset="6006471">I overlook, saying that the new Act provides that, in order to be nominated in the first primary, the candidate must receive not only a majority of the county unit votes but a majority of the popular votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.452" offset="6085151">And, if he does not receive a majority of the county unit votes and no county receives a majority of the county unit votes and a majority of the popular votes, there's a run-over primary between the candidate receiving the greatest number of county unit votes and the candidate receiving the greatest number of popular votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.625" offset="6173863">Unless, it so happens that the candidate will receive the greatest number of county unit votes, also received the greatest number of popular votes, but not a majority of either or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.712" offset="6226213">Then, it run-off is between the candidate with the highest number of county unit votes and the candidate with the highest number of popular votes but, in that run-off primary, the candidate who receives the majority of the most county unit votes, without being a majority because there'd be only two, is declared the nominee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.612" offset="6317850">There was this additional change in the nominating process that, as respects, officers -- candidates for officers, other than governor and United States Senate, the same rule applies of requiring the majority, both the county unit vote and the popular vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.235" offset="6408338">And, if there is no majority of both, then the two highest candidates would have to run again.</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.330" offset="6532681">The Neill Primary Act requires only plurality of county unit votes of candidates other than the governor and United States Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.136" offset="6571865">Whereas, this Act, as I read it, requires the same sort of majority for all the candidates than it does for governor and United States Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.438" offset="6613138">Now, the Court in this case said that this Act was invidiously discriminatory and it set forth its definition of invidious discrimination in the opinion and enjoined the Secretary of State, who was the state official who handles elections and putting in the voter's name on the ballot with the general election who is nominated under the Act or by virtue of the county unit system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.725" offset="6758275">Now, enjoined the party authorities from holding any primary in 1962 or any other time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.645" offset="6797981">Under any county unit system, unless it was such a county unit system as it would not be invidiously discriminatory under the opinion that was filed by the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.122" offset="6875826">As I read that opinion, it provides that the county unit system will not be invidiously discriminatory if it allocates unit votes to counties on a basis of population or if it allocates unit votes on the basis of – on the law of equal proportion that relates to the assignment of the representatives in Congress and will not be discriminatory if -- but it provides that no discrimination will be deemed invidious if there's no greater discrimination against any county than there is against the laws -- against any state in the assignment of electoral votes at the last election for president and vice-president of the United States.</text>
