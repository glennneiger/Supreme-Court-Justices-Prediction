            <text syncTime="22.389" offset="192972">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.228" offset="204257">Immediately before the recess, you asked me to address myself to some comments of Mrs. Siegel.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.356" offset="240828">Mrs. Siegel pointed out that the New York Commission had dealt, first of all, with many railroads and that is involving railroad employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.232" offset="292342">On this particular point, it is pointed out on page 21 of our brief that there is a vast difference in the intensity of regulation of railroad employees and persons like flight crew personnel on interstate airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.275" offset="368515">And the Federal Government doesn't even provide a license for a railroad engineer or truck or bus driver, but obviously there's a vast degree of licensing, certification, checking, re-examining, things of that nature in regard to pilots.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.992" offset="443329">Next, she --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="85.652" offset="445942">But you don't have -- for stewardess, you don't have to have a federal license, yet you say that you can't -- this Commission doesn't have jurisdiction over them?</text>

            <label>Mr. Patrick M. Westfeldt</label>
            <text syncTime="98.739" offset="498291">Mr. Chief Justice, on that point, when we get to the quest -- in the question of preemption, there is not only the subject of federal law coverage, but the next step bridged the gap whether it has to be exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.415" offset="557014">I do believe that between different classes of employees, there may be different degrees of federal regulation and the hostess and the pilot do present an example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.692" offset="626186">Hostesses for example are not subject as pilots are under Section 609 of the Civil Aeronautics Act, to constant examination and reexamination and proficiency checks and qualification judgments by federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.873" offset="682820">And there, for example, might be a difference in an expression of a congressional intent and for that reason, I really -- I say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.492" offset="729318">I say that the substantive coverage of federal law as embodied in 404 (b) of the Civil Aeronautics Act is sweeping and broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.032" offset="771532">I think with respect to flight crew members and pilots particularly, and the hostess is not a flight crew member.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.127" offset="799848">She rides on an airplane, but a flight crew member is defined in the Civil Aeronautics Regulation as including pilots and flight engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.965" offset="827225">This is a particular -- a particular group, but the evidence of an intent of Congress to establish in exclusivity, exclusive regulation with respect to pilots, I believe is much clear than with respect to any other position on an aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.838" offset="914683">Next, Mrs. Siegel also pointed out that there had been conciliation and persuasion in the relationship between the New York Commission and various airlines, and pointed particularly to the hostess on mobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.752" offset="986363">But I think it's also true that she indicated to this Court that these airlines had not gone to the court and I don't believe that she or I or anyone else knows of any court case which has upheld an order of a state anti-discrimination requiring affirmatively an airline to hire a pilot.</text>

            <text syncTime="684.254" offset="2840430">In that particular case, the Court analyzed the reason for the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.498" offset="2865403">They said that you have to read the contract as if the illegal clause isn't in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.119" offset="2895809">And it says then, the employer is the one who is discriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.025" offset="2915453">And then it went a little bit further and said that it would be absolutely impossible to enforce the Howard rule unless a commensurate duty were placed upon the employer and I think that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.426" offset="2985044">The rationale behind it is that a Railway Labor Act employer, an airline or a railroad or whoever it may be is a federally sponsored industry and it exists by virtue of its certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.497" offset="3057351">It exists and operates under a multitude of detailed federal regulation and of -- an employer in that sense acts as an instrumentality of the Government and can't engage in such discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.542" offset="3121507">However, that's my view of it and I think that even the Railway Labor Act -- there are more examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.619" offset="3153899">Railway Labor Act provides for settlement of grievances by binding arbitration, by a system board of adjustments in the case of airlines.</text>

            <text syncTime="924.901" offset="3802990">It actually has some specific pre-employment provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2278.801" offset="9218591">I would like to go one step further with the point that you're making, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.838" offset="9242728">There have been many cases where agency's activities and powers have remained dormant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.139" offset="9271881">I think an interesting case in this field is Boynton.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.693" offset="9286196">That was the one where the bus terminal was an integral part of the bus transportation system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.187" offset="9312110">The restaurant in the terminal was operated by a lessee, an independent contractor not operated by the Trailways Bus Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.794" offset="9342516">And the Interstate Commerce Commission took the view that that they didn't think they had the authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.030" offset="9371460">They disclaimed authority to regulate these lessee restaurant operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.442" offset="9393089">But this Court held that that was a violation of the Act and within a year after this Court's decision, the ICC then adopted a new set of regulations specifically to cover it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.901" offset="9447006">So here was an area of dormancy for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.296" offset="9460590">The administrative agency was told by this Court that by gosh!</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.686" offset="9478144">This is within the scope of your authority and they passed the -- adopted the regulation and implemented it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.057" offset="9503640">In the very recent case decided by this Court, the Pan American-Grace case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.631" offset="9529866">I believe there the CAB disclaimed authority on the particular issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.759" offset="9558392">But if the Court -- where the Court concluded that this was specifically within the authority of the CAB, the dormant exercise of that authority was of no moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.660" offset="9618056">So, I don't really think that the question of dormancy should change the issue when this changed the result of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3630.834" offset="14626670">I open by directing my remarks to the specific language of the Civil Aeronautics Act on the area of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.693" offset="14670137">A careful reading of the Act will lead us to the conclusion that the Congress of the United States has not occupied the field of the regulation of air carriers to the exclusions of the -- exclusion of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.525" offset="14741504">Section 676 of the Act which was the original CAA Act, now 49 United States Code Section 1506, there was the reenactment of the Civil Aeronautics Act in 1958; this provision reads remedy is not exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.650" offset="14845994">Nothing contained in this chapter shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.</text>

            <text syncTime="3771.049" offset="15187571">I do think, however, that it is significant that when the CAA Act was reenacted into the Federal Aviation Authority in 1958, if there was any whisper that this Act was going to incorporate into the Federal Administration Authority Act, an anti-discrimination provision with regard to race and the employees, and let's say an FEPC law being incorporated into the Civil Aeronautics Act, we would have not had the outstanding approval of the Southern Senators of the United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. T. Raber Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="3892.560" offset="15673657">Well, under the Connelly decision, under the Railway Labor Act, there was -- might be a question of whether or not she'd want to fight all the way up to this Court via the federal courts to establish jurisdiction, but again, I don't think it is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3907.590" offset="15733739">I think the prime purpose and thrust of the Railway Labor Act is certainly the collective bargaining is good or bad as it can be negotiated and under the CAB, the primary thrust is in relation to passengers and to traffic and to provide adequate service for that traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3931.802" offset="15830601">I think the brief of the United States which has been filed in this Court does the best job in speaking to that point because they point out that federal laws will not likely be held to preempt an area against state legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3950.353" offset="15904789">They also point out that it is never been held that the provisions of the CAB, Section 404 (b) and this is on page 39 of the brief of United States that it is never been held that these provisions were or are applicable to discrimination and employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.490" offset="15985351">Then, on page 41 they go into detail as to Section 404 (b) which is primarily concerned with transportation service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.463" offset="16033207">Certainly, we do not have any legislative history to guide us, but we do know that the purpose of the Civil Aeronautics Act has been preoccupied with service either of the transporting of property or the transporting of passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.842" offset="16114709">It is no surprise that it was applied for the protection of Ella Fitzgerald in the case when she was discriminated against and I think it's no surprise that California -- United States District Court in California has applied it when a coach passenger was discriminated against, but I don't think it has any application.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.436" offset="16209168">We are here concerned with whether or not the Civil Aeronautic Acts should be converted into a Fair Employment Practice Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.931" offset="16267055">I would take one moment to mention the Railway Labor Act and this Court on March 4th of this year passed on the scope of that Act in the case of the Brotherhood of Local Engineers and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, relying upon prior language of this Court in Terminal Association of St. Louis against Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.800" offset="16382621">To me, that language and the principles there enunciated would be determinative of any argument in this case as to the application of the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.614" offset="16425880">But primarily, we're confronted with concurrence of jurisdiction even if there were jurisdiction under some federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.542" offset="16477497">We do know that the most recent legislative history from the Congress of the United States and the consideration of a Fair Employment Practice Act is that they want to respect the jurisdiction of the State Commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.287" offset="16548551">They want to make it clear that it is their intention to cooperate with the state and municipal agencies to eliminate and promote the -- and lessen the discrimination in employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.502" offset="16637367">We have had the question of whether or not flight crew personnel should stand in a favored position.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.127" offset="16683865">Certainly, the employees of the United States, the U.S. Civil Service employees who were engaged in the business of handling the mail and the postal railcars are much closer to being instrumentalities of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.154" offset="16755963">There, this Court made clear that there was jurisdiction in the State of New York and their Anti-Discrimination Commission to bar the union provision which excluded from the Railway Mail Association all colored people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4187.921" offset="16855019">To me, especially after having an opportunity to read the briefs here, I feel that that issue is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.859" offset="16894830">Mr. Justice Harlan has inquired about the case of Pennsylvania against Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="4206.838" offset="16930774">To me, I do believe that there is a concurrent jurisdiction which was given to the State of Colorado by the Enabling Act of 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.616" offset="16985840">Certainly, we would all agree that sedition has a higher value in the hierarchy of our values than even race relation and yet in Pennsylvania against Nelson, this Court did find that there was concurrent jurisdiction.</text>
