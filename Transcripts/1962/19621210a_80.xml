            <text syncTime="8.838" offset="138742">Mr. Bauersfeld.</text>

          <turn speaker="carl_f_bauersfeld" startTime="11.232" stopTime="359.085">
            <label>Mr. Carl F. Bauersfeld</label>
            <text syncTime="11.232" offset="148250">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.878" offset="154833">This is an income tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.654" offset="166013">The issue is whether the accrual method of accounting be continue to be used for income tax purposes where advance receipts are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.762" offset="206451">By the accrual method of accounting is meant the taxpayer's recognition of income when earned by performance whether before or after payment and the deduction of expenses as incurred whether before or after actual payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.090" offset="279698">The facts necessary to understand the issue here present may be very briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.329" offset="308642">The taxpayer is -- of partner in a partnership that gave them instruction services under a contract for students.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.942" offset="335182">The students made down payment and agreed to pay the balance of the contract price in installments.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.039" offset="363499">The service contract is given rise to the tax controversy here where those as to which the student -- the taxpayer's performance extended beyond the taxable period in which the contracts were entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.203" offset="420133">Certified public accounting firm designed to partnerships bookkeeping system on the accrual basis accurately to match partnerships revenue derived from services rendered in each tax year with the costs of rendering services in such year.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.478" offset="493275">And I will explain the exact detail of the accounting system shortly in the course of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.275" offset="520443">The respondent initially required the partnership to include as income the entire face amount of each contract in the tax year in which it was entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.009" offset="567359">The respondent has now retreated from that position in this Court, but his confession does not, in any way, change or alter the basic issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.668" offset="606020">The respondent now says that the entire face amount of each contract need not be taken into consideration or into income at the time that is signed but he still contends that all advance receipts actually received by a partnership for future instruction must be reported as income no later than the year in which the receipt -- receipt is obtained and that all other amounts under the contracts are to be reportable in the tax year when the students were obligated to make payments.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.709" offset="742170">The respondent relying on the American Automobile Associate versus the United States in 367, U.S. urges that any accrual accounting system for deferring recognition of advance receipts must be rejected as violating tax accounting principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.978" offset="815313">Here, we differ very greatly with the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.600" offset="829733">If that case is read as we believe is proper then it is clear that the prior decisions of this Court in relevant tax statute authorized an accrual-basis taxpayer to be taxed on advanced receipts only in the year in which they are earned.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.565" offset="905592">On the other hand, if the respondent is correct as to the meaning of the A.A.A. case, accrual-basis taxpayers will be required to use the cash method of accounting when that -- whenever they are paid advance receipts by their customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.393" offset="968913">Now, incidentally by advance receipts, I mean any payments received before being earned by performance either by rendering services or providing goods as the case may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.515" offset="1021471">The American Automobile Association, we believe, did not reject the use of the accrual principle as such for reporting advance receipts of income in the tax year in which they are earned.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.580" offset="1077687">It did reject the application of that principle because of defects in bringing together the specific -- the costs of earning them with the receipts in that particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.457" offset="1133171">We contend that in A. A. A., the Court ruled only that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue was incurred to disregard the method of accrual accounting for advance receipt used by the taxpayer there because the method did not precisely match the portion of the costs of performing services or the association's individual members in the tax year with the proper portion of advance dues paid by each member.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.528" offset="1253439">The association's accrual accounting procedures required only that dues be recorded as income for tax purposes on a month-by-month basis ratably over the membership period.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.547" offset="1305579">Without regard to the actual costs of services rendered of the members for performance require, the Court found that the accounting system used by the association did not accurately and precisely matched revenues with related costs because the system would base on statistical computations and calculations and averages reflecting the overall costs of rendering services to all its members on a (Inaudible) -- accrual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.259" offset="1420413">The association I emphasized was unable to show that the method of deferral used for any relationship to the services yet to be performed or that the services to be performed would be equal for each member.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.826" offset="1474644">For this reason, we believe, the case stands only for the proposition that the accrual method of accounting they're use was so imprecise that the Commissioner's decision to set it aside was not arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.032" offset="1531486">Now, by contrast here --</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="359.085" offset="1539741">Which case are you talking about?</text>
            <text syncTime="360.491" offset="1545383">The Michigan case or the --</text>

            <text syncTime="362.828" offset="1554683">The American Automobile Association case.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.960" offset="1571192">By contrast here, the taxpayer's accrual accounting system precisely match revenues from services they performed in each tax year with related costs of performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.263" offset="1620407">This was accomplished primarily through the use of individual or accounting cards for each student.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.082" offset="1643708">At each contract was signed, the total contract price was recorded in an account entitled “deferred income”.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.317" offset="1676622">The individual student accounting cards identified each student, the hours of dancing instruction contracted for, the total contract price, the hours of instruction given, the payments made under each contract and at the end of each partnership tax year, the accounting card for each student was reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.747" offset="1766379">And the amount of income earned under each contract was determined by multiplying the number of hours those instruction given by the rate per hour on that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.089" offset="1807757">And whether cash in the amount of such income had been paid by the student or not, the deferred income account was reduced by the actual amount earned and earned income account increased by the same amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.379" offset="1864913">Such earned income from all contracts was totaled and reported as income on the accrual basis in the partnerships tax return for that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.740" offset="1902320">Since expenses were incurred in the period that the partnership rendered the services under the contract, the accounting method used precisely matched receipts and expenses for that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.484" offset="1953311">In addition, I should point out that all gains arising from the cancelation of a contract by a student or by the studio where there was no activity on the contract for a year was also reported as income on the tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.593" offset="2009736">As a result, there was absolutely no way the studio could defer reporting receipts as income indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.592" offset="2045785">It could not therefore avoid any taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.612" offset="2057801">And so the issue here is only the year of taxability.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.304" offset="2080580">We do not believe that the respondents seriously dispute the accuracy of the partnership system in -- system in matching revenues with related costs.</text>

            <text syncTime="745.751" offset="3086399">Respondent's real argument is that the American Automobile Association has a far broader meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.789" offset="3110536">The respondent says that the Court intended to proscribe the use of any accrual accounting method no matter how precisely it match the revenues with the expenses where advance receipts are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.894" offset="3162990">Respondent points to the discussion in the opinion regarding the legislative history of the enactment and the repeal of Sections 452, 462 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.828" offset="3218683">This portion of the Court's opinion, the respondent asserts, recognized as in the Commissioner the discretionary power to bar the use for tax purposes of any method of accounting or advance receipts no matter how accurate and how precise if it may involve the reporting of such receipts of income in a subsequent tax year.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.633" offset="3313873">We believe the respondent misinterprets the opinion and that the actual holding of the Court in A. A. A. was stated clearly and succinctly by Mr. Justice Clark at page 693 and I quote, “The Federal Revenue cannot without legislative consent and over objection of the Commissioner be made to depend upon average experience in rendering performance and turning a profit”.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.401" offset="3417004">The Court's concern was with the method of accrual accounting that is dependent upon average experiences of relating costs and revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.821" offset="3454621">Accordingly, we believe the consideration in the American Automobile of the legislative history, of the June 1954 Code provisions had relevance only to the particular type of accrual accounting method that was there at issue in which overall activities and averages of expense where relied upon in determining reportable income.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.763" offset="3550438">Now, the case at bar does not depend upon statistical calculations, estimates, or average experienced.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.601" offset="3581785">We are correct in our interpretation of American Automobile decision and we submit that the applicable revenue statutes in the long line of decisions of this Court support our position that an accrual-basis taxpayer having a precise and accurate accounting met -- system may defer the recognition of advance receipts to the tax year in which those receipts are earned by performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.819" offset="3690663">The respondent's argument that income of accrues at the time payments are received is in conflict with Sections 41 and 42 of the 1939 Code and 446 and 451 -- 51 of the 1954 Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.019" offset="3751476">And 4 -- Section 42 of the 1939 Code, is short and I like to read it, “The amount of all items of gross income shall be included in the year -- year in the tax full -- included gross income for the tax full year in which received by the taxpayer unless under methods of accounting permitted under Section 41 and the accrual method is such a method, any such amounts are to be properly accounted for as of a different period”.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.351" offset="3872789">Section 41 directs that the method of accounting used by the taxpayer in keeping his books shall govern the computations of his net income.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.777" offset="3906435">And it is only when that method of accounting used by the taxpayer in keeping his books does not clearly reflect income that the Commissioner has a discretion to compute his tax by another method.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.587" offset="3953768">The decisions of this Court, Court interpreting these provisions of a taxing statute, which this -- which have remained substantially unchanged since 1918 sustain our position that advance receipts are to be reported as income only when earned by performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.947" offset="4023150">In United States versus Anderson, in 269 U.S., this Court interpreted the tax accounting provisions of the Revenue Act of 1960, which was the first tax statute that permitted accrual accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.675" offset="4078111">The Court there required the taxpayer to accrue munitions taxes as a deduction in a year prior to the year in which the tax became due and prior to the year in which the taxpayer actually pay the munitions taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.217" offset="4136208">In ruling that the taxes had accrued in the year that the munitions to which the taxes related were sold, the Court declared the purpose of Congress in authorizing the use of the accrual method was and I quote, “To enable taxpayers to keep their books and make their returns according to scientific accounting principles by charging against income earned during the taxable period, the expenses incurred in, and properly attributable to the process of earning income during that period”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.508" offset="4285419">This case further pointed out that the statute was not concerned with due date for payment of the tax in a technical legal sense, rather, the accounting provisions of the statute were to be interpreted in an economic and bookkeeping sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.128" offset="4351875">And it is significant to note as pointed out in the brief for the amicus that the position that the Government is now taking is diametrically opposed to its position in Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.708" offset="4394193">In the Government's brief there, it said that the accrual accounting methods are designed to reflect income definitely earned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.150" offset="4432018">Another case Spring City Foundry Co. versus Commissioner in 292 U.S. involved the use of the accrual accounting methods in determining when income was to be reported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.288" offset="4476531">It recognized that the accrual accounting might require the taxpayer to report income before he receives any payment as a result of transaction that gives rise to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.082" offset="4523656">The Court declared that for an accrual-basis taxpayer, it is the right to receive not the actual receipt that determines the inclusion of amount in gross income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.146" offset="4567960">When the right to receive an amount becomes fixed, the right accrued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.558" offset="4585618">And then the Court made it clear that it understood the right to receive to be related to the earning of income because the opinion continues and says, “When a merchandising concern make sales, its inventory is reduced and a claim for the purchase price arises”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.203" offset="4656149">Now, such sales do not occur merely by the signing of a contract or even when payment is due under a contract as the respondent here urges but rather when a taxpayer performs under the contract or in the accounting terms used by the Court in that case, when there are accounts receivable arising from sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.684" offset="4742144">Finally and most recently, in United States versus Consolidated Edison in 366 U.S., it was held that the accrual-basis taxpayer's deduction for a contested tax is properly taken in the tax year to which a final determination of liability for the tax is made even though the tax had been paid in a prior year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.273" offset="4832423">This Court rejected the Commissioner's position that the liability accrued not later than the year of payment and said neither the Government nor an accrual-basis taxpayer may cause an item to be deducted in a year other than one in which it accrue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.149" offset="4895953">Now, this statement although made in a case involving the timing of deductions by an accrual-basis taxpayer is equally applicable in determining the tax year for which the taxpayers are to report advance receipts as income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.724" offset="4950288">In addition, I call the Court's attention to several decisions involving cash basis taxpayer such as United States versus Lewis and Burnet versus Sanford &amp; Brooks Company in 282 U.S., which the respondent has cited frequently in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.170" offset="5008071">In these cases, the Court explicitly recognized the difference between -- the difference between tax accounting for cash basis taxpayers and accrual-basis taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.102" offset="5055822">In particular, that taxes are to be paid on a basis of receipts only by cash basis taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.727" offset="5086229">For example, in Burnet versus Sanford &amp; Brooks Company, the Court said that items of gross income are required to be included in gross income for the taxable year in which receipt by the taxpayer unless they may be accounted for on the accrual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.794" offset="5158536">We urge that these decisions and others cited in our brief and in the brief of the amicus call for the rejection of the respondent's position that the Commissioner may set aside a method of accrual accounting solely because it postponed the reporting as income of amounts received to a tax year subsequent to the year of the receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.347" offset="5244740">This, in essence, completes the taxpayer's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.873" offset="5258846">Before closing, I should say that the Government's dispute with our position apart from the American Automobile Association case is grounded basically on two legal doctrines which are repeatedly referred to throughout its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.232" offset="5316315">These are the annual accounting requirement and the claim-of-right doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.490" offset="5333347">We do not understand the relevancy of these doctrines to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.034" offset="5351528">We believe that they have been discredited as the basis for taxing advance receipts of accrual-basis taxpayer in the year of receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.361" offset="5384861">In here, the same opinion in the American Automobile Association case, Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out that the Court does not base its decision on this theory referring into the annual accounting requirement presumably because the Court believes as I do that the theory is not valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.925" offset="5451107">Likewise, in the American Automobile, the respond -- the respondent pointing to the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan in the Automobile Club of Michigan, there agreed that the so-called claim-of-right doctrine was not applicable and in the dissenting opinion in American Automobile, it was specifically pointed out the Government had abandon the claim-of-right doctrine in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.459" offset="5541177">Now, we will reserve until later our reputation of what the Government has to say about these two doctrines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.429" offset="5569076">We do hope, however, that Government will explain why it is that it now seeks to ground its case on the annual accounting requirement in the claim-of-right doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="3122.552" offset="12593612">Congress would -- could, as it did briefly in the 1954 Code, as it has with respect to prepaid subscriptions, and as it had with respect to membership corporations specifically authorized the deferral of tax on certain prepayments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.480" offset="12677308">Or as the Treasury has by regulations which it now become embodied in the law by a virtue of long acceptance by the Congress permitted taxpayers to defer income on certain long term contracts, the percentage of completion method for treatment of some construction contracts or the completed contract method under which the tax on that the -- that the income from performance of a construction contract if the taxpayers so elects is not taxed until the contract is completed and the taxpayer adds up how much he received for performing the contract and how much the contract costs him and then includes an income in the year of completion they met and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.106" offset="12863822">But the Congress is doing this by -- on a selective basis and it seems -- we feel that the -- that sort of division of labor if I may between the judicial process, the administrative process and the legislative process is something that we would advocate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.276" offset="12976462">We -- the one final point so far as the comparison between this system which has in terms of its artificiality as that word is used in the three A's and in the Automobile Club case is concerned, we point out that the contract provides unless you make an appointment, your lesson is canceled that the performance is that the demand of the student and they -- as the -- as counsel has said the -- there is no day-by-day specificity for performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.711" offset="13150229">This system doesn't even take into account what they concede to be an experience of about 17% cancelations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.241" offset="13188368">There is no adjustment to the amount deferred on account of the expectation that as experiences demonstrated that about 17% of the students either die or become disabled or just quit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.288" offset="13244479">And we think that while this is a different kind of artificiality from that which the Court described in the three A's case, it still doesn't meet the standards that were inferred in Automobile Club of Michigan and the three A.</text>

            <text syncTime="3313.734" offset="13358268">One of the things that show the distortion of income that would result is in the case of where we have a note which is discounted -- not discounted but negotiated with the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.697" offset="13418141">In those cases, the record specifically found that the studio could not receive the 50% that was retained by the bank until after the student made the full payment on the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.945" offset="13491179">So for example, if we had a contract which provided with a note for $50 which was negotiated with the bank and the studio would receive $50 and then it would not get the other $50 until the student have made a complete payment on account, therefore, we didn't have a legal right to receive the amount even under the Commissioner's theory of the balance of the $50 in the tax year or at the time the contract was signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.087" offset="13619702">And the -- as a result of this and other things the -- it ends up with -- the effect of it is to buildup income at the time the contracts are signed in one year and then have that income subjected to tax rate at a higher rate and then when the performance is given in a subsequent tax year, we have a distortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.935" offset="13715101">And because of the tax rates, it means much more revenue would accrue to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.014" offset="13747388">The 1951 statute authorizing membership organizations to use an accrual accounting system as that -- that found in American Automobile Association dealt with that particular type of accrual accounting system where they had to use statistics and other things we feel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.160" offset="13835995">Here, we have the statute 41 and 42 which is always are permitted the use of the accrual accounting system.</text>
