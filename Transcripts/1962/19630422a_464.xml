            <text syncTime="22.259" offset="192449">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.057" offset="215646">These two cases present a single question but an important one, whether damage claims by federal prisoners for personal injuries sustained as an incident to their confinement and allegedly caused by the negligence of federal prison officials are cognizable under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.734" offset="302268">The facts are simple and the cases arose on grants of motions to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.076" offset="327659">Respondent Winston filed a complaint, alleging that while he was an inmate in the United States Penitentiary at Terre Haute, Indiana, he suffered a brain tumor.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.161" offset="376038">That prison medical officers failed to use reasonable skill and care in examining him negligently arrived at a mistaken diagnosis of his condition and negligently failed to give him needed medical treatment, and that as a result he became permanently blind.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.474" offset="453256">Mr. Winston seeks damages in the amount of $1 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.290" offset="476557">Respondent Muniz complaint alleged that while he was an inmate in the Federal Correctional Institution at Danbury, Connecticut, he was chased by a dozen fellow prisoners into a dormitory into which he was -- they were all thereafter locked by the guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.993" offset="559313">That he was beaten unconscious by these fellow inmates sustaining a skull fracture which led to his partial blindness, and that United States was negligent in failing to have available sufficient guards to prevent the incident and in allowing mentally and physically abnormal prisoners to mingle with other prisoners without adequate safeguards and supervision, and respondent Muniz claims damages of $250,000.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. William Doolittle</label>
            <text syncTime="166.240" offset="768293">I would say that the inference to be drawn from the complaint is that the fellow prisoners somehow had it in for Muniz or as Mr. Muniz alleges they were -- some of them were mentally and physically abnormal, but they -- for some reason or other they wanted to get him and that they chased him.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.887" offset="866931">I might mention that the Danbury Institution is not a maximum security institution, it's one in which there would be considerably more freedom of action on the part of the prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.709" offset="922206">Both complaints were dismissed on the ground that as the Federal Court had consistently held, the Federal Tort Claims Act does not apply to prisoner claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.032" offset="971525">The Second Circuit reversed both judgments, first by a divided panel and then by a five to four vote of the entire bench and this Court brought the case here on the government's petition for a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.129" offset="1031920">The question is of course one of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.729" offset="1046340">We must come as close as we can to divining the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.858" offset="1070791">The face of the Tort Claims Act discloses no clear purpose on the part of Congress either to include or to exclude prisoner claims, nor does the legislative history provide very much more enlightenment.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.606" offset="1133798">Both of the opinions of the courts below, I should say all four opinions of the courts below, and the government and the respondent have pointed to various circumstances in the history of the Act contending that there was one purpose or another on the part of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.662" offset="1230033">I think it's fair to say however that on balancing all of these competing assertions one is left with the rather clear impression that in passing the Federal Tort Claims Act Congress simply did not focus one way or the other on whether or not prisoner claims should be covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.616" offset="1309863">There is one element in the statutory context of the Tort Claims Act as opposed to its specific history that we do think argues quite persuasively against the coverage of prisoner claims by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.822" offset="1370676">Prior to the passage of the Federal Tort Claims Act, Congress had established an administrative compensation scheme for injured prisoners, which it did not repeal when it passed the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.291" offset="1428564">Originally this program covered just accidents taking place in the course of prison industries, but recently in 1961 it was amended so that it now embraces all work related injuries, including institutional maintenance work at the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.460" offset="1513200">Now we believe this remedy is the exclusive one for prisoners, and our belief is strengthened by the fact that Congress provided both in the original Act and in the Act as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.711" offset="1570252">That compensation under this program should be no greater than that allowed by the Federal Employees Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.466" offset="1601285">It would be anomalous we think under the circumstances to allow prisoners to bring suits under the Tort Claims Act, which is a remedy that is unavailable to government employees under the Federal Employees Compensation Act because of the exclusivity of the program there established.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.090" offset="1675682">In short from the standpoint of a workable consistent statutory scheme of remedies against the government, we think the administrative compensation program for prisoners like those for government employees and soldiers should be considered exclusive and that no Tort Claims Act remedy should be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.632" offset="1765857">I might also point out of course that the remedy of private bills is always available for cases of extreme inequity and in point of fact Congress has quite regularly passed private bills for the benefits of prisoners injured in prison.</text>

            <text syncTime="475.219" offset="2004198">Neither before amendment, nor after would it cover these claims, no question about that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.577" offset="2033664">What we consider to be the most compelling reason for denying prisoners the privilege of suing under the Tort Claims Act is the serious consequences that would flow from the allowance of such suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.451" offset="2089148">This Court in Feres against United States in 340 US, held that soldiers could not sue the government under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries incident to their military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.257" offset="2148394">The Court's reason for so ruling was that the allowance of such suits would have such an adverse impact on the unique federal relationship between soldiers and their superiors and would so undermine military discipline, that Congress could not be assumed to have intended them to be covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.372" offset="2232822">That same approach should we believe govern this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.800" offset="2250585">For to allow federal prisoners to sue the government would lead to such extreme results we do not see how Congress could knowingly have entertained such a design.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.650" offset="2289977">Now I should like to make one matter clear at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.382" offset="2304920">In resisting suits by federal prisoners, we are not reflecting any concern that such suits would cause an undue drain on the Federal Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.491" offset="2345357">We believe that the incidents of genuinely tortuous actionable conduct on the part of federal prison officials is so small, that there would be no more than a handful of successful suits, nor does our resistance reflect a feeling that we have anything to hide.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.770" offset="2418500">The federal prison system is one of the finest, if not the finest penal system in the world, and it proudly serves as a model not only for the States, but for other countries as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.599" offset="2461759">There is no aspect of prison administration that the Bureau of Prisons would wish to conceal from public view, except of course to the extent necessarily dictated by considerations of prison security.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.368" offset="2516825">And I might add that the bureau's excellent program for the review of prisoner grievances quickly disposes of any notion that legitimate complaints on the part of prisoners will go unheard.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.069" offset="2571682">What we are concerned about in resisting these suits is the same kind of concern that motivated this Court's decision in the Feres case that merely to permit prisoners to file suit to obtain discovery and to secure trial on the merits irrespective of the outcome of the trial will seriously undermine prison discipline and have a profoundly adverse impact on prison administration.</text>

            <text syncTime="782.347" offset="3232789">As far as officials analogous to those that would be involved in the present, in the Federal Prison System, no such right is available.</text>

            <text syncTime="919.737" offset="3782301">It's based upon their familiarity with the makeup of the Federal Prison population and the characteristics of its members, including a proved wet readiness on the part of the many of them to abuse remedial processes to the detriment of the discipline and administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.725" offset="3854294">It is based on their long experience with the difficulty of maintaining the sensitive balance between discipline, order and security on the one hand and rehabilitation, and correction on the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1069.108" offset="4379773">First, as I said before, we are not talking about the burden -- the financial burden of such suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.376" offset="4420838">But secondly and more importantly, the Indian Towing case and the Rayonier case, which followed it, disposed of the notion that conduct was beyond the scope of the Federal Tort Claims Act, merely because it was the kind of conduct that only Governments engage in, purely Governmental conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.109" offset="4507773">We do not make that claim here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.787" offset="4514565">We're not saying that this is outside of the scope of the act, merely because it's purely governmental.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.385" offset="4536926">We are talking about the impact of prisoner suits on the Federal Prison system, on its day-to-day operations and administration, on the discipline of prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.586" offset="4581752">And so, in that sense, we are talking in an entirely different realm from the Indian Towing and the Rayonier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.862" offset="4614771">Now if I may, I should like to suggest some of the problems that give raise to our fears.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.017" offset="4639431">The maintenance of a high and pervasive degree of discipline is absolutely essential to the accomplishment of penological objectives; not only prison order and security, but also prisoner rehabilitation as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.978" offset="4703274">And yet effective prison discipline is extremely difficult to achieve, far more so than Military discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.324" offset="4736711">Prisoners are typically hostile to the whole penal system and have no sympathy whatever for even its most beneficent objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.010" offset="4771401">While this hostility expresses itself in many ways, it naturally tends to focus upon the prison administrators and the guards right on up to the Warden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.242" offset="4816332">And it is in the face of this enmity and the tension that it breathes, that the prison administrators must achieve to maintain discipline and they must do so largely on the basis of their day-to-day personal relationships with the inmates, the confidence and the respect that they are able to inspire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.472" offset="4897311">For experience has shown that truly effective penal discipline cannot be grounded on the mere threat of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.527" offset="4929494">Nothing we think could be better calculated to breakdown these delicate personal relationships on which disciplined thus so largely depends, than permitting prisoners to file Tort suits against their custodians challenging their actions and their policies, whenever the prisoners are so disposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.958" offset="5007235">Inevitably the authority of a prison official who is entangled in litigation with a prisoner is undermined, in relation not only to the litigating prisoner himself, but to his fellow inmates as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.252" offset="5064391">And whether or not his claim has a shred of merit, the prisoners would have the satisfaction of knowing that the challenged officers would be subjected to investigation by their superiors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.125" offset="5107858">They would see the prison officials forced to answer the charges, submit to discovery and defend their actions in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.202" offset="5136175">And perhaps the prisoner himself would even get a chance to question his custodians on the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.338" offset="5160730">And of course to the extent that the individual official status is downgraded in the prison community, the litigating prisoners would be enhanced to the further expense of effective discipline.</text>

            <text syncTime="1421.922" offset="5791013">Another complication that we've referred to in our briefs is that if any disciplinary measure should be imposed on a litigating prisoner no matter, how justified it might be, it would be likely to be considered by the other members of the prisoner population as a form of retaliation on the part of the officials who's conduct has been questioned in the Tort suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.253" offset="5884426">And this would aggravate not only the hostility, intention in the prison atmosphere generally, but would no doubt lead to still further suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.975" offset="5923297">In addition to these more or less indirect affects on discipline, it seems clear that a frequent subject of prisoner suits would be disciplinary acts and programs themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.785" offset="5970526">Again wholly apart from the question of whether or not any of these challenges could be successfully asserted, its very possibility would impose a grave inhibition on the freedom of action, which custodial personnel need in dealing with disciplinary problems in a prison.</text>

            <text syncTime="2230.375" offset="9024867">The prosecution of most suits under the Tort Claims Act, most prisoner suits under the Tort Claims Act would probably depend to a considerable extent on discovery, involving, as they do, a unique kind of society operating wholly behind walls and barbed wire fences.</text>
            <text syncTime="2249.249" offset="9100413">Such discovery, apart from the administrative burden of compliance, would pose a great threat to prison security and order because security considerations are involved in almost every aspect of prisoner life, and this would be a problem in almost every case, but the Muniz Case here before the Court poses the question in a particularly striking way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.669" offset="9198007">The compliant there challenges the prison's staffing procedures for dealing with breaches of order.</text>

            <text syncTime="2723.029" offset="10995440">In short, we think that the Federal prison officials knowing as they know their system, knowing as they know the prisoner population with which they are dealing has a considerable basis for making these judgments as to what the problems would be that they face. And we do seriously question that the experience of these states would be very helpful in varying on our problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="2845.411" offset="11484975">Now the Government's argument is based in the first instance on the premise that what they referred to in their briefs as the legislative context of the act discloses no indication that the Congress intended to include to the claims of prisoners.</text>

            <text syncTime="2959.074" offset="11939715">Now I would like to emphasize first of all that the conduct charged in the Winston complaint is not only conduct that's clearly within the scope of the authority of the prison officials and medical officers at Terre Haute, but it's also a violation of the expressed statutory duty imposed on the Bureau of Prisons by Section 40, 42 of the criminal code, which makes it the duty of the Bureau to provide for the care, protection, and safety being of Federal prisoners, the statute is in my brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3052.885" offset="12314937">As I read those cases the test that they establish is whether a private person would be liable for similar negligence under the General Tort Law principles of the place or State where the tort was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.763" offset="12374392">The Winston complaint satisfies this test because malpractice by doctors and negligence by private hospitals is actionable in Indiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="3140.638" offset="12665919">That's just perfectly correct, but I think and I'm trying to come to that, let me just foreshadow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.991" offset="12687339">I think pretty clearly that Feres was overruled with respect to that ground of the decision by Indian Towing and Rayonier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.547" offset="12729553">And not – let me say this you got the line of cases Feres and then Dalehite which relies on Feres and then came Indian Towing and Rayonier which overruled Dalehite and also must have overruled Feres in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.114" offset="12775842">I should say of course that Indian -- that the present case seems to me presents a stronger case for liability than either Indian Towing or Rayonier in two respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.553" offset="12829550">First, here there is the kind of parallel private liability that Mr. Doolittle says it necessary, if it should be necessary I don't think it is and second, here also is the express statutory duty of care imposed on the Bureau of Prisons and there was no of course no express statutory duty in respect to the light housekeeper in the Indian Towing or the firefighters in Rayonier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.922" offset="12931009">For these reasons it seems to me that Winston's claim was well within the act if you take -- if you look at it that on space and that this conclusion is more than confirmed by the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.945" offset="12987120">And first I want to speak about the House and Senate reports which I quoted at page 12 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.355" offset="13016795">Those reports show, first of all that Congress deliberately meant to apply the principle of expressio unius, that is to say that the only classes of claims that it intended to accept from coverage was those which it specifically enumerated in what is now Section 2680.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.452" offset="13105194">The report shows another important thing, the reports, both Senate and the House report and that is that those claims which Congress specified in 2680 and withdrew from the coverage of the act were those first of all which it felt as a matter of policy should be free from the threat of damage suits and second goes as to which is thought that there was an alternative adequate remedy for compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.836" offset="13226715">And it seems to me therefore that although the House reports speaks in general terms and -- House and Senate reports, that the committees anticipated and rejected both of the arguments which Mr. Doolittle made here this afternoon; first, the argument that the administrative compensation remedy is exclusive and second the argument that running a prison is such a difficult job that it should be free of a threat of damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.730" offset="13338311">Now the only way you can reconcile the statements in those reports with Mr. Doolittle's position as to say, well this is a case of Congressional oversight and I think there are at least three reasons why you can't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.269" offset="13400482">By Congressional oversight I mean that as you indicated earlier Mr. Justice Goldberg that Congress just wasn't thinking about prisoners at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.286" offset="13436531">I'd say I think there are three items of Legislative history that make that kind of a conclusion impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.249" offset="13464325">First of all there were 21 private bills for the relief of prisoners that the Congress passed in the decade to prior to the Tort Claims Act, and there must have been many, many more that were dealt within committee and defiled of passage, because the ratio of private bills introduced to private bills passed in those days was about 7 to 1.</text>

            <text syncTime="3465.304" offset="13964622">So that Congress really has acted on the representation that's being made to the Court here today, plus the fact of course that there have been a number of Lower Court decisions denying the coverage of prisoners, but Congress has never made any independent determination as to what its own intent was when it passed the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.900" offset="14050931">Now there is a second reason why I think that it's impossible to say this is a matter of oversight and that is that six Trot Claims bills that were antecedent to the bill that was finally enacted, the 46th Act, contained specific exemptions, which either excluded prisoner claims entirely from the Act or adopted the New York approach and excluded suits during the incarceration of the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.235" offset="14176319">Finally the report of a House committee shows that Congress was familiar with the operation of the New York Tort Claims Act, which was passed in 1929 and which is patterned exactly after the Federal Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.751" offset="14234415">It waives the states immunity from -- or to put the other way the Federal Act has patterned after the New York Act, the [Inaudible] Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.809" offset="14270568">The New York Act waives the state sovereign immunity and makes the State's liability the equivalent of the liability of private person.</text>

            <text syncTime="3723.219" offset="14996250">It so happens however that those three statutes were held to be statutes which did not waive the sovereign immunity of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.659" offset="15038046">But the effect of those statutes were simply to give a new remedy through a suit for preexisting forms of state liability and it was because of the limitation of those statutes, that the Courts in those States held that prisoners couldn't sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.310" offset="15112652">Now this was true of the Illinois Statute, which was passed in 1917, Mr. Justice Goldberg and continued till 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.122" offset="15147865">In 1945 the same year the Federal Act was passed, Illinois passed a Tort Claim Statute substantially the equivalent of the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.975" offset="15191228">Under the old statute, the Illinois cases had held like California and Arizona the prisoners couldn't sue because there was no waiver of the sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.375" offset="15224874">Under the new statute, which was similarly a general statute and which doesn't talk about prisoners, Illinois has consistently held the prisoners can sue because the statute did waive, the only impediment to suit and that was the sovereign immunity of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="3899.149" offset="15699989">Now I'd like to come to the decision in Feres because it seems to me that if it weren't for that case nobody could stand before this Court and seriously argue that the claims of prisoners aren't covered under the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.389" offset="15756936">Feres, if you read the opinion and I think you have to distinguish between the grounds that the Court assigned for its opinion and grounds that have subsequently been assigned to support the opinion, if you look at the opinion itself, it assigned two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.049" offset="15819525">First of all it said that Congress has already provided a uniform compensation system for servicemen, which the Court described as comprehensive, uniform and certain and not negligible or negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.684" offset="15886085">And it said that Congress having done that, it couldn't have intended this uniform federal system to exclude a remedy under the Act based as the ex-remedy is on the vagaries of the state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.445" offset="15949197">Now first of all the result in the Feres case is inapplicable to the facts here because as Mr. Doolittle conceded that he must, neither Winston's claim or Muniz's claim is compensable under this administrative scheme for prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3979.412" offset="16020982">Second, and I don't want to go into it here, but I show in my brief starting at page 21 that the limited federal scheme authorizing administrative compensation for work related injuries lacks all of the characteristics that is comprehensiveness, uniformity and certainty and adequacy that were stressed in the Feres case as the grounds for making the remedy exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.111" offset="16135816">Besides this and in any event, this ground for the decision in Feres, that's to say the presence of a compensation system for servicemen is contrary both to the decision of this Court in Brooks versus United States, which preceded Feres and in the decision in United States versus Brown which followed Feres; both cases, both of those cases said that a service man, who incurred injuries while not on active duty could sue under the Tort Claims Act and they dismissed the argument that the compensation scheme, for veterans was an exclusive remedy.</text>

            <label>Mr. John J. Abt</label>
            <text syncTime="4079.943" offset="16423163">Now the second ground for the Feres decision was the one that you called -- you mentioned earlier Mr. Justice Goldberg, and that is that there is no precedent in American law for permitting a solider or militiamen on active duty to recover for negligence either from the superior officers or from his Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.234" offset="16496306">And Mr. Justice Jackson in the opinion in that case said that the purpose, and I quote him, “That the purpose of the Act was not to visit the government with novel and unprecedented liabilities.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4109.154" offset="16539982">And therefore that it shouldn't be construed to authorize, what he called a radical departure from established law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.014" offset="16571434">Now first of all that ground for the decision in Feres is inapplicable here, I don't want to do repeat what was said during Mr. Doolittle's argument, but we have the New York Court of Claims statute, the Illinois Court of Claim Statute, the North Carolina Court of Claim statute, there are three states in which the prisoner has been allowed to recover without benefits of a statute and furthermore there are there many cases, which allow recovery against jailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.627" offset="16693896">Now it's perfectly true as Mr. Doolittle says that most, if not all of those cases had referenced the local jails, but if you read the decisions nothing was made to hinge on the fact that they were local jails rather than penitentiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.100" offset="16751783">Also the Chief Justice I think inquired as to how many prisoner cases there had been in Illinois, unfortunately the Illinois Court of Claims is very late in reporting its cases, so there are considerably more.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.089" offset="16799744">The clerk of the Court tells me on appearance of cases, I think there are six or seven perhaps reported cases, but the very positive of the number of cases that have been instituted there and in North Carolina as well seems to me, it tends completely to destroy Mr. Doolittle's argument that prisoners are going to take advantage of Tort Claims statutes if they are permitted to sue under them, to raise all of kinds trouble, discovery proceedings and whatnot.</text>
            <text syncTime="4199.871" offset="16902875">There is a minimum or let's put it this way, an easily manageable number of cases that have been instituted in these three states, which allow them under their Tort claim Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.011" offset="16939447">But coming back to the Feres, the presence of this volume of judicial decision permitting prisoners to recover, distinguishes this case from the case of the serviceman whereas Mr. Justice Jackson said there wasn't a single case anywhere permitting such recovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="4262.480" offset="17153337">Well I didn't go into it myself, because I assume that the Court had assumed that they were covered and it seems to me as I recall the decision now Mr. Justice Jackson at very end gives examples or indicates the recovery that was -- or the payments that were made under the Compensation Act, in at least -- it seems to me at least two of the cases, if not all of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.764" offset="17250408">Now it may well be that as this Court indicated both in Brooks versus the United States and United States versus Brown, that the basic but unstated ground for the decision in Feres was a belief that allowing servicemen on activity duty to recover for tort injuries to themselves, would be so extreme and so outlandish that Congress just couldn't have contemplated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.411" offset="17372975">However, none of the considerations that are applicable to a solider on active duty has any bearing on the case of a prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4325.138" offset="17403904">The difference in the two situations it seems to me are highlighted by the statute that imposes a duty of care, protection and safe keeping on Bureau of Prisons in its relation to prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.309" offset="17444655">It's inconceivable to me that Congress should impose a similar duty on the Department of the Army in relation to soldiers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.504" offset="17481435">And if there was nothing outlandish or absurd in the imposition of that duty by Congress on the Bureau of Prisons, then how can anyone say that it's outlandish for Congress to permit a remedy for a breach of a duty which itself has prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4363.520" offset="17557504">I don't -- I've dealt with in my brief at some length with the government's discussion of all of these dire consequences, which it seems to me in the first place are refuted -- that is the arguments are refuted by the point that the Chief Justice made while Mr. Doolittle was arguing, and that is to say that all of this is suppositions and we do have many years of experience in the three states with Tort Claims Act which allow prisoners to recover and there are many states which have permitted recovery against jailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.936" offset="17695117">And out of that vast experience, long experience at least the government can give us no examples of anything undesirable or harmful that's occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4409.583" offset="17741720">And it seems to me though about all we have here is a splendid example of observation that Mr. Justice Jackson made in his dissent in the Dalehite case, in which he said the government as a defendant can exert an unctuous persuasiveness because it can close official carelessness with the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4431.520" offset="17829491">And it seems to that that's what Mr. Doolittle's argument and the government's argument in this case comes down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4437.094" offset="17851747">Of course the Bureau of Prisoners -- Prison has an administrator's normal aversion to any form of supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4445.586" offset="17885706">Every administrator thinks he is doing a wonderful job, in a complex situation that only he himself can handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="4452.988" offset="17915277">And he fears that the job will be ruined if the heavy and untutored hand of court or a regulatory body is allowed to intrude.</text>
            <text syncTime="4462.195" offset="17952162">Now the only novelty in this case is that here it's the Department of Justice, which has abandoned its normal role of poo-pooing these fears when they're advanced on behalf of some private interests and urges instead that they be dignified and given status as a controlling principle of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.203" offset="18036172">Finally I'd like to suggest that the proposal of this Court carve out an exception for prisoner claims is really inequitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.707" offset="18078177">What is made at the time and the whole doctrine of sovereign immunity from Tort liability has fallen into such disrepute that even without waiting for an action by the legislature the highest Courts of five states California, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Florida have advocated the doctrine by judicial decision, and significantly in the Florida case the Supreme Court of Florida sitting en banc took occasion to advocate the doctrine in a case involving a prisoner, and none of the other four states, which have advocated the doctrine by judicial decision have made any reservations either for the claims of a prisoner or of anybody else.</text>

            <text syncTime="4682.675" offset="18834056">They say that the diversity of the state laws create a lottery and that the state laws are different in the place of incarceration of an inmate should not determine his right to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="4696.094" offset="18887764">They say secondly, to permit such action would destroy the uniform system and they then allude to the disciplinary problems which Mr. Doolittle has expressed great concern about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4710.421" offset="18945024">We disagree with the government's contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4713.387" offset="18956936">In the Lower Court briefs and here and in Winston's brief, and the government's briefs, all of the cases that deal with these situations I think have been quite fully discussed, but we have become convinced on behalf of Muniz that the heart of this matter involves what we would term the supremacy of Federal Tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4735.426" offset="19045125">The circumstances of this case are peculiar, they are peculiarly Federal and they are involved in a situation where there is Federal law which has uniformity throughout the 50 States and the territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="4751.652" offset="19110013">Now what do I mean by that?</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.198" offset="19120149">The basis of the Muniz claim is that by virtue of the cited statute in our brief creating the bureau of prisons and imposing the duties upon the superintendent of prisons and the bureau to safety prisoners, to safeguard those being held for arraignment and to safeguard the welfare of material witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="4775.177" offset="19204054">Those are the duties in the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4777.627" offset="19213876">Incidentally Mr. Muniz should be denied recovery here then so must you deny recovery to a material witness who was in custody of the United States Marshal, perhaps a very great peril to himself waiting to testify in a case involving national interest because the duties which are imposed by statute upon the U.S Marshals and the bureau of prisons extend to material witnesses as well as to prisoners.</text>

            <text syncTime="4826.368" offset="19408854">Now, this is the one of the main points that we make.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.160" offset="19420035">We don't incidentally concede in this case that the Law of Connecticut fails to give us a cause of action, we claim it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.572" offset="19449710">But we say that the words in the Tort Claims Act law of the place mean law of the place, it does not say law of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4847.696" offset="19494118">If Congress had wanted to use the words Mr. Justice Goldberg, law of the State, the choice was very simple for Congress to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="4855.857" offset="19526823">And so, we submit that under the position taken by the Solicitor General today that if the little words law of the place means law of the State, then under situations where there is an act of negligence occurring in a Federal enclave absent a specific statute making state law applicable the Federal Tort Claims Act would not apply on a Federal enclave and --</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard D. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="4899.532" offset="19701530">Well, that is true that there is such a body of law, but we would submit that under the interpretation expressed by the government in its brief where the statutory words -- if the statutory construction in the Tort Claims Act is to be confined to law of the state, then where a state may not have a particular law even the duties which are imposed under the statute upon the bureau of prisons would have no applicability and there could be no cause of action under the Tort Claims Act for violation of a duty which Congress had imposed upon the Bureau of Prisons and its Superintendent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.568" offset="19869654">Now, we allege claim, intend that the Federal law is the law of the land, that this Federal law imposing the duty upon the Bureau of Prisons is uniform and that in this situation that it is the law or duties imposed upon the Bureau of Prisons, which becomes the law of the place and in the case of Muniz, Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="4968.161" offset="19976025">And that beyond the point relative to the law of the place, I might say that the constitution of the United States plays a most vital part in our argument, because over 50 years ago in the case of Logan against the United States in 144 U.S. 263, the Court had said prior to the imposition by legislation of duties upon the Bureau of Prisons that the warden and that the prison has a duty of safekeeping and safeguarding a prisoner under the Constitution of the United States, ahortly thereafter did Congress enact the statute imposing the very duties expressed in the language used in Logan against the United States, which was based upon the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5015.574" offset="20165674">Now, we say that denial of the right of recovery for breach of the duty imposed by Congress negates the very existence of the duty imposed by the Bureau of Prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5028.145" offset="20215933">The government in this particular situation has assumed the burden by the creation of its uniform system of taking care of prisons or operating prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5038.079" offset="20255640">We claim that the existence of this duty gives rise to a remedy and that one who has the duty and assumes the burden must perform it properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5048.160" offset="20295973">The existence of our comment in reference to Federal statutes creating a Federal Tort law maybe found to be supported in the United States against Standard Oil case on page 308 and in the Clearfield Trust case, which the government cites in its reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.445" offset="20377161">And on page 308, the Court says, “In this sense therefore, there remains what may be termed for want of a better label, an area of federal common law or perhaps more accurately law of independent federal decision outside the constitutional realm untouched by the Erie decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5086.686" offset="20450095">As the government points out, this has been demonstrated broadly not only by the Clearfield and National Metropolitan Bank Cases, but also by other decisions rendered here since the Erie case went down.</text>
            <text syncTime="5097.480" offset="20493249">Whether or not the government is also correct in saying the fact was foreshadowed the same day by Hinderlider versus La Plata Company in a unanimous opinion delivered likewise by Mr. Justice Brandeis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5108.740" offset="20538284">Now in the case of Hess against the United States and Hatahley against United States cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5116.326" offset="20568691">The Hatahley case in particular makes reference to an act I believe it's called a National Grazing Act, the words are used Grazing Act, this is an act which applies in every state where grazing of animals takes place and the Court in writing its opinion says that this is a matter of Federal concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.376" offset="20644864">This is a law which is uniform over the United States and the uniform Federal law is applicable.</text>
