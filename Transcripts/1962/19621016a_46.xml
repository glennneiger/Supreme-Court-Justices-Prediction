            <label>Mr. William Harbison</label>
            <text syncTime="41.838" offset="270712">Alright, sir and so I will take just about 10 or 12 minutes, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.624" offset="289834">May it please the Court, these are -- this is a Miller Act case arising in the Middle District of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.549" offset="317524">The case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.898" offset="334973">If the Court please, briefly, I can state the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.713" offset="346258">This is a procedure case involving Rule 13 (a) or one of the other rules, Rule 8 in which, we have this situation, may it please the Court, and I think there is no dispute really about the underlying facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.336" offset="396727">Southern Construction Company is in the general contracting business and had two separates sets of contracts with the United States Government for the rehabilitation of barracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.261" offset="436433">One set of these contracts was at Fort Benning, Georgia, the other contract a much smaller one was at Fort Campbell, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.625" offset="469870">The two contracts were let separately and there was no -- nothing in common between them except it happened to be the same general contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.221" offset="504247">It happened also that the Pickard Engineering Company of Washington D.C. was the mechanical subcontractor, the successful bidder on each set of contracts, submitting a bid in Georgia and being awarded the subcontract there, another bid in Tennessee, being awarded the bid there.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.408" offset="573001">The work on the two contracts, however, proceeded simultaneously and Pickard had one common supplier furnishing the majority of his materials being the Atlas Supply Company of Atlanta, Georgia from whom he bought most of the materials that he put into both of these two jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.046" offset="647607">Pickard left both jobs, if the Court please, before they were complete under circumstances that are not now particularly material except that he left the Fort Campbell job in December 1955, he left the Fort Benning jobs shortly after that and Southern the prime contractor completed both jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.748" offset="726392">At the time when Pickard left, if the Court please, he owed admittedly on account at Fort Campbell, Tennessee to at least of $34,520.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.933" offset="767143">He had so certified to Southern and Atlas had also billed Southern in that amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.907" offset="795042">At the time he left Fort Benning, Georgia, Atlas claimed that Southern owed it or that Pickard owed it and Southern secondarily under the Miller Act a $104,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.266" offset="844466">The record in this shows that Southern never disputed the account at Fort Campbell, Tennessee, had no basis upon which they disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.101" offset="875813">But it disputed in its entirely the billing made to it because it was liable under the Miller Act by Atlas at Fort Benning, Georgia and denied any validity to that account whatever of Mr. Pickard's.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.729" offset="930252">If the Court please, businessmen don't always act as one might wish them to act and in August 1956, Southern and Atlas met together and Southern paid Atlas a lump sum of $35,000 and accepted a complete release of it's liability to Atlas under the Miller Act on both jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.555" offset="1009560">Those -- that check is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.827" offset="1014680">The money was paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.985" offset="1019277">There is no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.691" offset="1030144">The money -- the payment was not allocated by Southern at that time to either job, both of them had some -- had gone to substantial completion.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.186" offset="1056162">Mr. Pickard was shown of the record to be insolvent and Southern simply did not make an allocation at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.099" offset="1083747">They just made the payment and settled a business transaction and the check is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.388" offset="1108929">Then, if the Court please, in December 1956, some months after this payment was made on August, 1956, Mr. Pickard brought a suit against Southern under the Miller Act in the Middle District of Georgia claiming that he had not been fully paid on both jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.151" offset="1167966">He -- his suit clearly, a complaint is in the record, shows that he sued in that action in December 1956, on both at Fort Campbell, Tennessee job and the Fort Benning, Georgia job claiming certain amounts due to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.234" offset="1220315">Of course as the Court knows the time for pleading is 20 days and within the 20 days, Southern filed an answer and counterclaim setting up the defense that it had more than paid to Mr. Pickard or to his suppliers, the contract prices on both jobs and asserting a counterclaim against him on both jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.055" offset="1295548">At that time, the $35,000 payment was included in this Georgia case because the Tennessee contract was also in the Georgia case at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.532" offset="1329507">Now it is true that the Miller Act provides that suits shall be brought in the district where the work is done and nowhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.876" offset="1354898">So some months later in April of 1957, Mr. Pickard brought a separate suit in the Middle District of Tennessee on the Fort Campbell, Tennessee contract, although that wasn't formally deleted from the pleadings in Georgia until the trial of the Georgia case, he did bring a separate suit in Tennessee in April 1957 on the Tennessee contract alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.500" offset="1445386">It was then, if the Court please, that Southern was faced with the problem of where this $35,000 payment made on August 1956 properly should be allocated because it was now faced with two separates suits on two separates contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.954" offset="1507140">The underlying facts as I have stated to the Court were that Southern had paid $34,520 on the Tennessee contract which it did not dispute to Atlas and a token payment on the Fort Benning's contract which it had disputed in its entirety and obtained a complete release.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.476" offset="1573282">Now, Southern is a bonded contractor and obviously its position about there being a substantial dispute in the Atlas billings must have been correct because otherwise there would be no reason for Atlas to make such a settlement with Southern.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.225" offset="1624273">So Southern, if the Court please, under this undertaking claimed this $34,520 payment as a credit on the Tennessee contract which the District Court allowed over the objection however of Mr. Pickard that the $34,520 payment or $35,000 payment was a compulsory counterclaim and had to be asserted by Southern in the Georgia proceedings or not be asserted at all that -- paid it to assert it there would be res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.827" offset="1734719">The Georgia case was tried first in March of 1959 and in that trial of that case, neither side listed this $35,000 payment or any part of it as being a credit on the Georgia contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.032" offset="1791457">That has been found concurrently by both the District and the Court of Appeals and this is a fact, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.436" offset="1813086">It was not claimed by Southern in the trial of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.556" offset="1825625">It was not credited by Mr. Pickard in the trial of that case as properly being allocable to that case, any part of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.872" offset="1850911">The Tennessee case came only for trial some months later and Southern claimed the $35,000 payment or $34,520 of it in as a credit in the Tennessee case which the District Court allowed, but which this Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed and held that the $35,000 payment was a compulsory counterclaim under Rule 13 (a) in Georgia and could not be asserted by Southern in the Tennessee case.</text>

            <text syncTime="805.920" offset="3327039">Being part of the issues, it was adjudicated there and when an effort was made at a subsequent date to litigate the same claim in the later Tennessee proceeding it was res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.448" offset="3381164">Now, there's been some talk about or argument about to what extent was an attempt made to prove the claim in the Georgia case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1142.797" offset="4674539">But to answer Mr. Justice Black's question, the reason they did not want to litigate this particular item in Georgia is because they thought they could use it to better advantage in Tennessee.</text>
