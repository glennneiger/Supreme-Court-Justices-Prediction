            <text syncTime="23.071" offset="195688">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.547" offset="237589">This case is a case of first impression in an Appellate Court, involving the question of whether under the antitrust laws of the United States, a District Court is empowered upon a finding of violation of the antitrust laws by a trade union, and frame a remedy which in addition to the usual prohibitory injunctive provisions applicable to the particular restraints of trade shown goes beyond that and includes the following three orders directed to the trade union.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.364" offset="444792">First, that it expel from its membership all of a certain class of members.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.313" offset="480632">Second, that it be perpetually enjoined from ever taking that class of workmen into membership in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.123" offset="515845">Thirdly, that if any present member of the union should become a member of that class by virtue of his manner of work that he should thereupon summarily be expelled from the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.156" offset="580002">These three express provisions were included in the decree below by the subject of a direct appeal from a single judge decision here as the sole issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.311" offset="636635">The matter is of importance obviously and of novelty because so far as I have been able to determine, during the more than 70 years since the passage of the original antitrust law, the Sherman Act was not until 1960 in a case arising in the Southern District of New York that this kind of a remedy not quite as drastic as this but in the same vain namely the forced of expulsion of union members was ordered by District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.181" offset="796087">I am not aware in the Government, although quite diligent in digging up forms of decrees, has not cited one whether has ever been a consent decree.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles K. Hackler</label>
            <text syncTime="187.040" offset="851571">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.973" offset="855228">That is the referred to in all of our briefs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.088" offset="867767">It's the Smokehouse case and referred to by the decision below here.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.715" offset="910190">This case arose by a civil complaint being filed against a Local Union of some 2400 members whose headquarters is in Los Angeles, California.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.214" offset="972257">These members for the most part are engaged in truck driving and loading and unloading of trucks and incidental work in the meat and provision in allied industries in that city.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.907" offset="1027009">In addition to the union, it was made a defendant one of its business agents and four of its members who were self-employed meat peddlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.332" offset="1092733">The case went to the Court upon a comprehensive stipulation of fact, no evidence was taken, some 74 separate items of facts in great detail were stipulated between counsel and upon a stipulation on the part of all of the defendants that the Court, that they had violated the antitrust laws in the respects shown, a further stipulation that the Court could enter an order that such violations have taken place and also a decree enjoining each and every type of violation with leaving only for the Court's decision whether, in addition to that ordinary unusual remedy, there should in addition the expulsion remedies that I just described and which had been a part of the prayer of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.495" offset="1333373">Apparently following the Fish Smokers case in 1960, it has become in this type of case, that is a case involving so-called ?self-employed workmen? involved in an antitrust violation, the tendency on the part of the antitrust division to seek that kind of a broadened decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.783" offset="1434520">The Court took the stipulation and heard argument and briefs, handed down its decision agreeing with the Government and adding the three specific mandatory injunctive provisions for expulsion and refusal of membership in the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.829" offset="1522709">Now, it would be unduly burdensome upon the Court to go in to the very detailed factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.814" offset="1558653">It's all set forth in a stipulation in the record which the Court copied in haec verba in his findings of fact and conclusions of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.408" offset="1600972">Suffice it to say that that stipulation maybe summarized as follows; that this law for union beginning to the activities primarily of the individual business agent who was joined as a defendant and four of its grease peddler members who comprise a grease peddler committee, a sort of a self-anointed committee within, to their activities primarily over the period of time from October 1954 to the time of the complaint in May of 1959, engaged in a plan and program most extensively violative of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.232" offset="1796263">The program consisted primarily of the following, the union was approached by some 10 or more grease peddlers in the City of Los Angeles who found that their earnings have suffered for the past couple of years, they asked the union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.029" offset="1879437">Mr. Singer, the union agent on behalf of the union, told them that they would be accepted into membership and then and there an arrangement or understanding was arrived at between them which called for the unionization of all of these types of grease peddlers in the city some 45 to 50 in number, an arrangement that none but union members would be permitted or authorized to pick up grease at restaurants and sell it processing houses, an arrangement and understanding that some effort would be made to stabilize or fix the price at which these peddlers would pay the restaurants for their waste grease and the price at which they would sell the waste grease to the processing houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.140" offset="2079953">That this program envisaged the raising of the earnings of these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.954" offset="2103150">These earnings were based upon the difference between the buy and sell price of the waste product.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.524" offset="2129481">That the conspiracy was carried out to a considerable detail and in candor requires me to state in many instances in a most ruthless manner and one that finds neither support in the antitrust laws nor in morality either so far as that is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.735" offset="2202311">These individuals and the agents ran wild.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.543" offset="2217566">They used picket lines inappropriately to accomplish these objectives and the net effect of it, and this is not questioned here because it emerges from the stipulation, was that only union members engaged in this somewhat peripheral industry in that city that prices were fixed, territories were allocated, it was an agreement among these union members not to compete one with the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.141" offset="2327907">The evidence disclosed, and this is somewhat significant I believe, that this small segment of members the union were a sort of an internal subdivision given the name of Local 626-B, although not separately chartered, they were a separate division so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.104" offset="2403767">They held separate meetings, this committee and Mr. Singer, their mentor, handled punishments for violation of the rules that had been set up in the program that had been set up, and in all practical respects, operated separately from the Local.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.091" offset="2483702">I point out as perhaps significant that there is nothing in this very detailed stipulation and I might state the Government will agree with me that whatever the Government said it had evidence to prove, I agree to stipulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.039" offset="2535528">This had resulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.889" offset="2538977">There had been a companion indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.288" offset="2548485">Discovery was quite limited and the facts are strong as the Government could make them as the price of the decree, be that as it may.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.359" offset="2584848">With all of these, there is nothing in the decree suggesting action on the part of the elected executive board of the Local Union or the 2400 members despite the fact that that constitution and evidence shows that it is an autonomous Local, its members, its officers elected, and conducted membership meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.293" offset="2680560">That is not said by way of retaliation of the conduct that took place nor to say that the Local Union was not responsible because its responsible officials and members indeed must have looked the other way when this rather sordid business was taking place.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.851" offset="2738761">Now having said this Your Honors, we come the proposition as to whether or not under these set of facts, it is appropriate to import into this antitrust case the concepts of divestiture, divorcement that have been common in antitrust cases, involving commercial enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.253" offset="2860387">The court below and I take it to be also the theory, the primary theory of the Government here, addressed itself, so far as I know the first time in an antitrust case, to a determination as to whether or not these grease peddlers, 45 strong, were the ?proper subject of unionization.?</text>
            <text syncTime="716.541" offset="2969579">He said that they were not the proper subject of unionization, ?unless the evidence affirmatively showed that at the trial of the case that they were somehow competitive with employee and truck drivers doing the same kind of work as they themselves were doing.?</text>
            <text syncTime="738.601" offset="3057768">And secondly, ?unless there was evidence below that the union's motivation in taking this kind of individual into membership was a desire and a purpose to protect the negotiated wages and working conditions of the employee, truck drivers against diminution at the hands of the self-employed truck driver.?</text>
            <text syncTime="765.543" offset="3165497">Having made those two dicta, the Court said there is no evidence in the 72 stipulations that reasonably could -- the -- that an inference could be made of these two conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.487" offset="3213354">Therefore the Court said, these men are businessmen, they are entrepreneurs, they are not the proper subject of unionization.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.880" offset="3246895">That being true, I have the power, indeed the duty, under this aggravated set of facts to perpetually not only exclude the four defendants, the 45 other peddlers who had membership in the union, but to perpetually enjoin the union from taking into membership ever in the future a self-employed grease peddler regardless of its motivation, regardless of its relationship or indeed regardless as to whether even that peddler had any knowledge of the facts of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="825.278" offset="3404466">That comes Your Honor as rather a surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.711" offset="3422229">Although, the findings of the Court and indeed even in the brief in this Court the correct summary of the Court's findings repeatedly referred to the fact that it was this small segment, a sort of an infiltration of the union or a misalliance as it says in some places between the union as an entity and the small segment, that this small segment was itself the conspiracy when a decree was drafted, there was nothing said about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.400" offset="3545004">There was this, without any explanation, there was a movement cleared over to the general body of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.130" offset="3567888">When the decree was drafted both the Court and opposing counsel unconsciously perhaps or certainly without any logic in the record moved over and treated the commonality of the 2400 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.010" offset="3615431">The whole unincorporated association, they equated it with this segment.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.071" offset="3635702">We would not have imposed -- opposed and indeed I state to the Court today that on this record, certainly no one could reasonably oppose a decree that ordered this union, stop having a separate segment within your membership, separate meetings of this group because that might be a tendency to repeat what has happened in the past, scatter these people among your members.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.089" offset="3723682">There is no legitimate reason to have these self-employed grease peddlers at least to function even ad hoc separately with union membership, but now the arguments that are made here --</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.513" offset="4865442">Such purchases were usually made from larger establishments and the grease peddlers usually applied restaurant grease from the smaller establishments and other sources where the supply of restaurant grease was relatively small or irregular in unavailability."</text>

            <text syncTime="1490.065" offset="6063626">No Your Honor, for this reason I take really two approaches to the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.493" offset="6085360">First, I think the Court is wrong in saying that in a case of this kind there must be specific evidence before that Court of the union's right to represent these people where the overall situation shows that there is an economic interplay of the two groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.858" offset="6158817">Or put it in another way, very frequently, a union has a right to organize or represent people before there has become a conflict, before the owner-operator or peddler has undermined his working conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.967" offset="6219212">He has a right because of his economic position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.451" offset="6229138">Now, we think we're right there because certainly this Court has said so without any evidence in the Duplex case where they said it was a victim of the trade union movement, that persons in a trade union necessarily are interested in the standards of work and earnings for their craft in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.156" offset="6320044">The Court didn't say there was evidence below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.509" offset="6333419">Now, we feel that certainly, I'll put it in another way, certainly in drafting a decree which is only supposed to be protective of the policies of the Act, not itself full dressed, where the violations are clear, we feel that it isn't incumbent upon us to come in and say, to do so might nullify the very value to the union of representing those people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.532" offset="6437491">They would say that -- we would have to wait until conditions have been broken down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.264" offset="6460479">The second, and I think to me much more cogent point and one that the Court just brushed over without really any consideration and that is the express provisions of the Clayton Act with respect to labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.058" offset="6519620">Now, this raises the whole question and I think this is why 70 years had gone by without there being divestitures of union membership, although there have been --</text>

            <text syncTime="1612.102" offset="6551803">Now, let's take a case of -- where there clearly was not actual or potential economic competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.726" offset="6574268">Let's say that all the retail druggists in the Los Angeles area joined the Teamsters Union and formed a sub-local and in that guise carried on flagrant violations of the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.797" offset="6630588">Couldn't the Court order then that the union expel them and keep them out?</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.021" offset="7931486">I'd like to start by addressing myself to the question of the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.591" offset="7953742">I refer the Court to footnote in the Columbia River Packers Association versus Hinton, where the Court says, Cf. Section 6 of the Clayton Act, a labor of a human being is not a commodity or article of commerce, 38 Stat. 731.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.577" offset="8033677">The Norris-LaGuardia Act manifesting the purpose of the Congress further to extend the prohibition of Section 20 of the Clayton Act, New Negro Alliance versus Grocery Company, cannot be taken as having erased the distinction between an association of commodity sellers and association of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.067" offset="8119672">Now in this case, the Court is dealing with an association of commodity sellers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.189" offset="8148093">626-B is an association of independent businessmen by stipulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.410" offset="8177037">The Court, we submit, need it to dissolve 626-B in order to prevent future violations of law and in order to restore competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.137" offset="8223953">We submit that nothing in the policy of labor laws protects an association of independent businessmen formed within a labor union from dissolution which is ordered as a result of a necessity arising from previous violation of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2112.050" offset="8551528">This Court itself decreed such relief in the Hartford-Empire case where lower court injunctions against an association whose primary functions were dissemination of trade statistics which have been used to violate the Sherman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2158.477" offset="8737311">We submit that the lower court was fully justified because there was here such relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.742" offset="8762389">I may say that the suggestion that 626-B would somehow be dissolved without excluding it from the union is a surprise to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.901" offset="8807006">626-B only existed as a subdivision of the union and it derived its strength and its power from its association with the union and we submit that the lower court's judgment in this respect was quite correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2594.046" offset="10479574">That is our third reason for a necessity for dissolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.419" offset="10505070">Here are two processors, consisting of the only two persons in this market, who are still a market for peddlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.619" offset="10533804">One of them is a union member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.641" offset="10541955">He owes his existence in this business virtually to the union in 1958, the Star Grease, in 1958, when this company began business, came to the union representative and said, ?We're having trouble selling our grease, and would you dispose 80000 pounds of it for us.?</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.459" offset="10621158">The union business representatives went to another one, another processor and said, ?Would you sell it for him??</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.380" offset="10644877">This processor fearing union trouble did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.579" offset="10657729">Shortly thereafter, in meeting of the union committee and the processors, this processor, Star Grease, was given one-third of the available supply of the grease supplied by these peddlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.899" offset="10730977">At this meeting, the union business representative Myer Singer was a defendant here represented Star Grease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.210" offset="10756263">And so here we have a company, three and a half months after he's gone into a business getting one-third of the available supply as a result of meeting of the union and at the same time having the union help in disposing of its grease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.607" offset="10805791">This is one of the two processors left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.721" offset="10814255">The other one, one member of that firm is a union member and the other is a -- his partner has six months after the institution of this case and threatened by the business representative of the union and told that when another processor had been taking care of him, he would be next because he had testified before a Senate Investigating Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.358" offset="10928776">Now, in this circumstance, we think that the Court to free up this market, to provide a place where peddlers who did not wish to belong to the union could sell their grease without being discriminated against because they either did or did not represent themselves to be union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.797" offset="10998575">The Court could properly order that these members be excluded from the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2733.723" offset="11038281">So that we conclude that there was a necessity here and arose not of any general policy that independent peddlers ought not to belong to a union but out of these specific facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.912" offset="11086973">A point is also made with respect to the alleged fact of due process with respect to those peddlers who were not before the Court and that issue has not been argued and we rest on our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.432" offset="11145070">We ask that the decree of the lower court be affirmed.</text>
