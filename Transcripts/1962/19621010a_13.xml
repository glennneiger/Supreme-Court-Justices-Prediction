            <text syncTime="29.408" offset="220975">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.762" offset="230379">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.845" offset="258800">It is before the Court on the pleadings, the courts below having dismissed the plaintiff's second amended declarations.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.035" offset="299551">It is a suit for damages for breach of a collective bargaining agreement between the Newspaper Guild of Detroit and the respondent, the Evening News Association, which publishes a newspaper in that city.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.825" offset="374680">The plaintiff sued on his own behalf and as the assignee of 49 other named employees of the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.602" offset="421804">The second amended declaration as alleged is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.718" offset="442284">The plaintiff and his assignees were employees of the newspaper and were members of the union, the Newspaper Guild of Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.738" offset="486275">At all irrelevant times, a collective bargaining agreement was in effect between the Guild and the respondent newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.792" offset="526503">This agreement provided and this language appears on page five of the record, “There shall be no discrimination against any employee because of his membership or activity in the Guild.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.111" offset="591809">The declaration goes on to allege that while this contract was in effect, there was a strike at the newspaper by a union other than the Guild.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.626" offset="645831">That during the strike, the Guild members, that is the plaintiff and his assignors, were ready and willing to work during the strike but that the newspaper would not permit them to, that it locked them out in whole or in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.015" offset="715421">But that -- at the same time, the paper permitted other employees who did not belong to any union to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.555" offset="753560">The declaration alleges that this discrimination violated the contract and it asked $20,000 in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.407" offset="792952">The respondent moved to dismiss on the following grounds, this is the respondent's language.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.105" offset="823777">One, defendant is charged with X which if true constitute an unfair labor practice as defined in the National Labor Relations Act as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.792" offset="874559">Two, the National Labor Relations Board has been vested by virtue of such amended Act with the exclusive jurisdiction of the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.193" offset="920116">The parties stipulated that the respondent is engaged in commerce within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.235" offset="952299">They were in agreement in the courts below and are in agreement here also that the language of the contract in part parallel Section 8 (a) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act, so that the Acts alleged as a violation of the contract would also be a violation of Section 8 (a) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.549" offset="1057520">The trial court granted the respondent's motion to dismiss and the Supreme Court of Michigan affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="272.562" offset="1193671">However, the Michigan cases mostly seemed to be brought by these class suits or by individual union members.</text>

            <text syncTime="318.835" offset="1378722">Well, the Westinghouse was interpreted by some people and the respondent's still interprets it as saying that only the individuals can sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.192" offset="1420100">I think that is a mistaken interpretation in and all the way it was, but it is an interpretation that had some currency in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.503" offset="1461373">There was no reason that the union could not have been joined apart from the misapprehension on that point.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas E. Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="367.378" offset="1572864">The Supreme Court of Michigan dismissed the case on the broad ground at the pre-emption doctrine laid down by this Court in the second Garmon case controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.682" offset="1638066">It quoted at length from the opinion of the Court in that case and from the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Harlan and said that under either one federal pre-emption apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.326" offset="1692714">In other words, it treated this case just as if it had been a support case or an equity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.539" offset="1717478">It rejected the contention that a suit for breach of a collective bargaining agreement called for a different pre-emption rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.339" offset="1756766">The question here thus is whether his suit on a collective bargaining agreement for breach of the agreement may be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.611" offset="1797831">When the acts claimed to constitute the breach would also constitute an unfair labor practice under the National Labor Relations Act and within the jurisdiction of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.938" offset="1847150">Now we contend that in a series of cases at the last term, this Court held that the pre-emption doctrine of such cases as Garmon is not applicable in a suit for breach of collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.091" offset="1907754">We do not believe these cases are distinguishable on any relevant ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.102" offset="1931786">Secondly, we contend that the same result should be reached in any event if the issue is regarded as an open one.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.291" offset="1964492">The first of the cases which seems to us decisive of those at the last term is Dowd Box against Courtney.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.465" offset="2001272">That was a suit brought in state court in Massachusetts by local union officers as representatives of the membership of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.030" offset="2047457">It was brought -- I take it as a class suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.253" offset="2064384">There, the union -- there had been a contract in effect between the union and the company and negotiations looking to a modification of the contract had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.110" offset="2119764">The union claimed that certain -- to go about changes including a wage increase had been agreed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.685" offset="2146095">The company however repudiated the new agreement on the ground that its bargaining representatives had acted without authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.373" offset="2180890">(Inaudible) the complaint as for a declaration that a new or modified contract was in effect and was legally binding and for a many judgment, apparently the first half of this period became moot to the passage of time while the litigation was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.730" offset="2254242">And the final decree entered in the Massachusetts courts awarded specific sums of money to named employees, the amounts being the difference of the higher wages provided by the new contract from those do under the old contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.391" offset="2328952">Now, here the -- and then Massachusetts too, the company argued federal pre-emption on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.899" offset="2358941">They said first, that the suit couldn't be brought in state court because it should've been brought in federal court, the jurisdiction of the federal courts under Section 301 (a) is exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.063" offset="2407633">It argued secondly that the conduct alleged also amounted to an unfair labor practice, that is, the company's repudiation of its bargaining representatives was a refusal to bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.108" offset="2463848">And it argued that at least in that situation federal jurisdiction but though the jurisdiction on the federal courts rather than of the Board should be exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.006" offset="2519437">This Court rejected the claim of federal pre-emption.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.073" offset="2535633">It pointed out that the Congress in enacting the Taft-Hartley Act had deliberately dropped proposals to make breach of contract and unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.214" offset="2600208">Both the Taft Bill in the Senate and the Hartley Bill in the House have contained such provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.104" offset="2631764">They were however dropped in conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.971" offset="2643257">And this Court quoted from the report of the House Conferees as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.111" offset="2667813">Once parties have made a collective bargaining contract, the enforcement of that contract should be left the usual processes of the law and not the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.342" offset="2720789">This Court declared that the considerations which had let it define pre-emption in such cases as Garner, Garmon, Anheuser-Busch were not applicable to suits for breach of collective bargaining agreements, because Congress had not elected to entrust cases growing out of such a breach exclusively to the NLRB but had left them to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.177" offset="2824129">In answer to the claim that federal jurisdiction under 301 (a) was exclusive, the Court pointed out that the purpose of that provision was to provide an additional remedy not to contract an existing one.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.913" offset="2887032">Finally, an answer to the contention that diversities and conflicts of doctrine would result from concurrent jurisdiction in this situation the Court stated that the federal common law of Labor Relations would control so that this Court could, if need be, resolve such conflicts and diversities.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.285" offset="2976475">Now the Court in its opinion did not explicitly point out that the conduct alleged to as a breach of contract was also an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.016" offset="3023391">It can hardly have escaped the Court's attention however.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.640" offset="3037915">The opinion seems in part directed to that point and the case was argued at the same time as Lucas Flour which also involved that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.843" offset="3082742">And then Lucas Flour which was decided shortly after Dowd Box, the Dowd Box opinion is cited on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.820" offset="3118686">Lucas Flour is the second of the cases at the last term which we think disposed of this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.035" offset="3147525">That is rather the reversed situation of Dowd Box.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.872" offset="3162885">There the employers sued the union for damages for a strike claimed to be in violation of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.264" offset="3200397">The -- an agreement did not have a specific no-strike clause, it had a provision for final and binding arbitration of issues including issues as to discharge of an employee which was what had provoked the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.838" offset="3274689">The substantive issue which was before this Court was whether in that situation a strike was a violation of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.747" offset="3318366">The union contended of course that it was not and that the strike was therefore protected concerted activity under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.576" offset="3361625">It also argued that since its defense raised this issue within the competence of the NLRB that the pre-emption doctrine of Garmon should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.492" offset="3413347">This Court disposed of this contention in a footnote, Footnote 9 in 369 United States, at page 101.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.763" offset="3454412">It said that since this was a suit for breach of contract that the doctrine of -- the pre-emption doctrine did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.613" offset="3489834">It cited a number of Court of Appeals decisions which have held that a suit for breach of a collective bargaining agreement maybe maintained even though the acts constituting the breach are also an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.243" offset="3552319">That is the general rule followed which has been followed in the Courts of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.308" offset="3576560">I think the way the state court authority probably is the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.869" offset="3594846">Anyway this Court cited those cases which hold that.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.495" offset="3613341">It cited the Dowd Box case and finally before it said, “It is of course true that conduct which is a violation of a contractual obligation may also be conduct constituting an unfair labor practice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="893.841" offset="3678751">And what has been said is not to imply that enforcement by a court of a contract obligation affects the jurisdiction of the NLRB to remedy unfair labor practices as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.146" offset="3735907">The final case which seems to us dispositive of the issue is Atkinson v. Sinclair which in this respect was very like Lucas Flour.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.051" offset="3791600">That is, it was a suit for a strike in alleged violation of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.855" offset="3814797">It had the additional feature that one count of the suit was laid against individual employees and purported to be and federal jurisdiction now is invoked on grounds of diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.029" offset="3867460">The Court disposed of the pre-emption contention in our footnote simply saying again that it doesn't apply in suits for breach of collective agreements.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas E. Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="999.867" offset="4102875">But I think that there are numerous other grounds on which this case has to be decided against the respondent anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.128" offset="4147911">Now in our brief, we have an inordinate length, reargued the question which I contend it was disposed off in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.390" offset="4200887">We have argued that even if the issue be treated as an open one, the Court should reach the conclusion that the pre-emption doctrine of Garmon and Garner does not apply in contract actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.903" offset="4271000">I will go over that very hurriedly since these points are not as I understand it, directly controverted by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.618" offset="4309870">We say in essence that there is really no way that courts can avoid sometimes getting into issues which are within the competence of the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.738" offset="4362324">Lucas Flour for example is a case just of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.321" offset="4384684">There, the claim that the strike was protected activity if that had precluded judicial jurisdiction, no remedy would have been available to the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.929" offset="4431078">Again, the Board has found it necessary to decide precisely the issue which this Court decided in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.203" offset="4472142">For example, when a strike takes place, under board doctrine if the strike is in violation of a contract, the employer may discharge the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.211" offset="4520208">Therefore when that happens, it is necessary for the Board to decide whether the strike violates the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.198" offset="4548211">And in the Mead case, exactly on facts exactly like those in Lucas Flour, the Board did hold that a strike over an issue which the contract says maybe submitted to final combining arbitration violates the contract, so that the employer was within his rights in discharging the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.146" offset="4639953">That of course, is exactly the issue of interpretation of the National Labor Relations Act which this Court decided in Lucas Flour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.494" offset="4673390">And this Court cited the Mead case and other Board cases for its ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.596" offset="4705782">So that there really is no way as we see it that cases -- that issues can be taken in one category and the Courts can be kept out of them or that the Board on the other hand can be kept out of issues of contract interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.067" offset="4775685">As a matter of fact, such sections as 8 (e), the so-called hot cargo clause of the contract of the Taft-Hartley Act as amended by Landrum-Griffin, make it an unfair labor practice for the parties to enter into a specified type of agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.927" offset="4855097">So the Board automatically is in the business of deciding whether the agreements have been entered into and of interpreting those agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.445" offset="4889161">It does the same thing under the union security provisions of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.183" offset="4912149">But let me pass that and come to the respondent's contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.559" offset="4941615">Now, as I said below the respondent argued broadly as such cases as Garmon apply equally to suits for breach of a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.887" offset="5002951">And that's what the Michigan courts held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.437" offset="5021132">That argument I take it is no longer open and I for -- and I take it in recognition of that, the respondent now undertakes to support the decision below on various narrower grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.812" offset="5082572">It undertakes to distinguish the decisions of the last term on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.574" offset="5109635">First, the respondent says that the contractual provision here directly parallels the content of Section 8 (a) (3) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.082" offset="5159685">So that its enforcement in the courts involves the possibility of a more direct conflict with NLRB doctrine then was involved in the cases at the last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.376" offset="5216841">However, I don't see how you can get a possibility of anymore direct conflict and was present in the Lucas Flour case, the very issue which the Court decided there was one which have been decided by the Board and the Court relied on Board decisions as well as on Court decisions of -- for its interpretation of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.307" offset="5316629">In other argument, the respondent makes is that here the remedy available before the NLRB would parallel that available in Court, that is back wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.329" offset="5376711">And that this was not true of the cases at the last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.380" offset="5392906">That is true but the second Garmon decision explicitly holds that it is not the comparability of remedies which determines a pre-emption or the lack of pre-emption but wholly different considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.218" offset="5476289">Also, the respondent undertakes to lay cases involving arbitration to one side.He undertakes to say that -- or to concede that arbitrators have concurrent jurisdiction or that courts have concurrent jurisdiction in enforcing agreements to arbitrate or in enforcing arbitration awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.717" offset="5578271">The respondent seems to consider this required by the Warrior case, Lincoln Mills and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.556" offset="5605648">However, the possibility of conflict with NLRB doctrine is just as great in arbitration as it is in suits for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.173" offset="5656116">Professor Christensen of the NYU Law School has written a very lengthy article on the point here at issue which appears in 37 NYU Law Review 411 in support of the respondent's position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.784" offset="5734484">His principal concern however is the danger of conflict between arbitration and the NLRB and there of course is a conflict between arbitration and the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.477" offset="5797282">But, the NLRB doesn't have to accept the result if it doesn't want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.451" offset="5821210">Let me give with a single example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.137" offset="5835943">There is probably no issue which is more arbitrated than employer discharges of employees for conduct during a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.243" offset="5888293">Now, nearly every collective bargaining agreement contains a provision that an employer may discharge only for cost or for just cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.253" offset="5936358">This same standard is in effect written under the National Labor Relations Act which provides that the Board can't reinstate employees discharged for cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.670" offset="5986095">So that in end, that there is no common or type of arbitration and there is no common or type of Board case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.429" offset="6017128">Now the respondent makes much of the fact that here, the contractual language parallels 8 (a) (3) rather specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.549" offset="6065612">The result however would be just the same if it were these standard contract clause prohibiting discharge except for cost because no court or arbitrator will uphold the discharge for conduct protected under the National Act, so that the (Inaudible) -- the result is the same anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.714" offset="6142203">Now in these cases, the Board either orders the employee reinstated and either finds that he did not engage in misconduct warranting discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.773" offset="6186506">If it finds that, it orders you reinstated with back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.378" offset="6200926">Now, the arbitrators apply pretty much the same substantive standard but they very often resort to compromise solutions with the NLRB, it is all or not -- or nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.576" offset="6249723">With an arbitrator on the other hand, they quite often order reinstatement but without back pay or they sustained suspension for some given period of time or some intermediate result like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.048" offset="6299564">The fact that the arbitrators do tailor the remedy in a fashion that the Board does not -- is one reason for that the union so often resort to arbitration in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.431" offset="6353063">And of course, there is in the sense that the diverging remedy would be a possibility of a different result from that which would be had before the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.811" offset="6394650">However, in these cases, the Board has said that it will follow the arbitration absent some good reason for not doing so.And that is the Board's own policy and has been for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.476" offset="6469256">Also, I do not see any way that this Court could reach the result that there is pre-emption in damage suits for breach of contract but no pre-emption in arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.627" offset="6537906">The question of pre-emption turns ultimately on the intention of Congress, real or imputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.404" offset="6573014">And I do not know how anyone could impute to the Congress which enacted the Taft-Hartley Act, an intention to prefer arbitration over suits for damages as respect to pre-emption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.990" offset="6631320">Section 301 is written in terms of suits for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.399" offset="6652949">It was only by construction that suits to enforce arbitration agreements were brought within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.028" offset="6683460">Now, let me turn to the arguments which respondent principally makes here and makes for the first time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1677.646" offset="6813968">We have not briefed the point whether individuals could sue under Section 301 (a) because we think it's most unlikely that the Court were rigid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.681" offset="6870079">There being so many other grounds of disposing of the case which I will come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.076" offset="6895679">The point is briefed in a footnote in the Government's reply brief and is briefed by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.433" offset="6933086">I would think that the question of the right of individuals to sue under Section 301 (a) should be controlled by the determination of the substantive issue of their right under collective bargaining agreements rather than as a procedural matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.703" offset="7026186">And I -- as I understand that that what is the Government is saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.875" offset="7042905">In other words, if it is held that individuals have rights under collective agreements which they can enforce separately, which they can enforce in a state court for example, then I think that they should be permitted to sue under Section 301 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.653" offset="7125974">It seems to me that it would be an absurd result to say that they could sue only in state court and not under 301 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.029" offset="7155440">There is some language in the legislative history by Mr. Martin which is set forth in the Government's brief which supports this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.039" offset="7187519">There's also some legislative history just the opposite ways which is set forth in the respondent's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.244" offset="7224299">Now, respondent's principal contention here is that this case differs from those decided by the last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.910" offset="7267035">In that, it is controlled by state substantive law while those were controlled by federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.583" offset="7301726">Therefore, according to the respondent, the pre-emption doctrine of Garmon and that line of authorities must be applied to prevent conflicts of doctrines which this Court could not resolve since this Court may not review state substantive law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.781" offset="7382497">If we agreed that state substantive law controlled here, I think we would agree that the pre-emption doctrines should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.348" offset="7420740">However, we do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.945" offset="7431189">The key issue thus between us is whether state law, state substantive law controls.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.699" offset="7698160">For the proposition that state law controls, a respondent goes back to the Westinghouse case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.912" offset="7730970">It says that that case holds that suit on a right uniquely personal to the employees such as wages may not be brought by a union in federal court under Section 301 (a) or by the employees in federal court under 301 (a) but only by the employees in a state court if this is a suit like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.208" offset="7844237">And that federal substantive law applies only in suits which are or could have been brought by the union under Section 301 (a) and that this is not such a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.215" offset="7900244">Now let us consider first this question of the reach of the federal common law of Labor Relations which is I think the most important issue presented by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.953" offset="7951235">Now the respondent contends, we think it is a misapprehension that this body of federal common law exist solely by virtue of Section 301 (a) and the interpretation which this Court gave that section in the Lincoln Mills case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.381" offset="8028871">And they say that this law therefore applies only in suits within the procedural reach of Section 301 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.580" offset="8065651">They argue that even in a diversity case in the federal courts state substantive law would have to control under the doctrine of Erie Railroad against Tompkins.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.563" offset="8109641">Now, we don't believe that the reach of the federal common law of Labor Relations is limited in any such fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.123" offset="8143914">We suggest that it encompasses all issues as to the negotiation, interpretation, and enforcement of collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.463" offset="8181217">For example, this Court has held that a union in negotiating a contract must fairly represent all employees in the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.387" offset="8228968">And then it may not discriminate against any of them on grounds for instance of reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.686" offset="8254151">This Court laid down that doctrine in the Steel case, a case decided before the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.107" offset="8283826">It was first applied in contracts negotiated under the Railway Labor Act but it has since been extended to contracts negotiated under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas E. Harris</label>
            <text syncTime="2239.217" offset="9060289">Well, I think that it would have been difficult to do it just on that basis though I have sometimes -- the Hutchison case, of course, suggest that there were some possibilities there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.680" offset="9134059">Now, another question as I've already indicated which it seems to me has to be controlled by federal law is whether individual employees have individual rights which they may enforce independently of or in opposition to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.066" offset="9207620">Again, let's suppo -- again, here, the respondent could have urged for instance that the union and the respondent had entered into a binding settlement of the claims sued of, or that the suit should be stayed pending arbitration or dismissed because of the union's failure to take the case to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.152" offset="9287973">I think any of those defenses would have been controlled by a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.504" offset="9305422">As -- respects the availability of arbitration, Atkinson and Sinclair and (Inaudible) both seem to indicate that this federal law that would control the sufficiency of that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.524" offset="9357458">Now, if respondent's contention that the reach of federal law is restricted by the jurisdictional reach of 301 (a) were accepted, it would get a number of absurd results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.542" offset="9429556">In the first place, uniform federal law which prevailed as to rights running to or against a union but rights personal to employees would be subject to the big reason of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.435" offset="9489115">States would even be free to adopt the conservative view of the privy council or the radical view of Dean Shulman that collective bargaining agreements are mere moral obligations, not enforceable at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.090" offset="9559751">I don't suppose that the states would adopt such a principle but they would be free too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.736" offset="9582320">Secondly, however, according to respondent, federal doctrine would still impinge even if as to these rights personal to employees if the case involved issues are arguably subject to the jurisdiction of the NLRB such as this one or in that even pre-emption doctrines would come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.954" offset="9671137">Thirdly, the courts would have to decide in each case whether the right asserted runs to the employee individually or to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.060" offset="9711574">As Justice Frankfurter pointed out in Westinghouse, that is a difficult determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.002" offset="9739368">The lower courts were not even in agreement on whether an individual employee may sue for discharge in alleged violation of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.691" offset="9778134">That is perhaps the commonest to all employee claims but there is wide diversity among the state courts on whether the employee may assert this or only the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.297" offset="9820557">New York, who whilst that the union may assert it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.222" offset="9836231">Some other states, all -- the employee made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.026" offset="9851486">Each state court determination on statistic whether a right was an individual one or whether it ran to the union, would itself present a federal question subject to review by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.682" offset="9914075">Let's consider another difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.176" offset="9928077">Many rights have what the former Professor Clark's told a double aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.149" offset="9959946">This is such a provision, a provision against discrimination on account of union membership or activity, certainly is not for the sole benefit of individual employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.668" offset="10014072">It is through the protection of the union as an entity also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.053" offset="10031626">So that surely the union too would be entitled to force that -- enforce that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.541" offset="10057540">Now according to respondent, you apparently would have the result that if the union sued to enforce that right, federal law would control and the suit could be brought in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.633" offset="10105919">But if the individual employee sued to enforce it, it could only be brought in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.649" offset="10141968">Now look at ballot box, there, there were two prayers for relief bags, one, a declaration that the whole of contract was valid, second, a prayer for money damages or lost wages for individual employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.435" offset="10213125">According to the respondent, the first of these would be a suit maintainable by the union, the second only by the individual employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.848" offset="10254712">Now, I don't know whether respondent thinks that the federal law would control as to half of the action and state law as to the other half or when the first cause of action became moot whether it started out as controlled by federal law and ended up as controlled by state law or what.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.433" offset="10329109">Actually of course, when the case reached this Court, it involved only individual claims of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.306" offset="10360560">This Court explicitly held that federal law controlled Dowd Box is as I see it, a complete answer to respondent's contention on this point because it is impossible to imagine claims more personal to the employees than the money judgments for back wages entered in the names of individual employees in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.266" offset="10468394">Yet this Court held that the federal common law controlled.</text>

            <text syncTime="2891.192" offset="11668146">Federal jurisdiction there was invoked not under 301 (a) but diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.998" offset="11699388">And it was thought to state a cause of action under the common law of Indiana.</text>

            <text syncTime="2911.568" offset="11749648">Now it isn't clear whether the Court meant that that suit could have been brought under 301 (a) or whether it meant that federal law controlled anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.023" offset="11791444">But on either proposition, it is fatal to the respondents because if those individual defendants could be sued under 301 (a) these individual plaintiffs here presumably can sue under 301 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.696" offset="11854137">As I said earlier however it seems to me that the truly decisive answer to the contention is that the reach of the federal common law is in no way limited by the jurisdictional scope of 301 (a).</text>

            <text syncTime="3026.534" offset="12209507">Now, actually even the Westinghouse case to begin with, did not hold as the respondent asserts it to hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.068" offset="12247646">Five of the eight justices who participated in that case expressed the view that a union may enforce a wage claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.291" offset="12284531">Now a majority of the Court did hold that under -- that 301 (a) should be construed -- should not be construed as conferring jurisdiction on the federal courts over a suit while whomever brought to enforce the wage provisions of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.482" offset="12357256">But there was no majority for the provision that the proposition that a union couldn't enforce those provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.963" offset="12387244">I think the restrictive interpretation given to Section 301 (a) in Westinghouse rested primarily on the Court's desire to avoid the question as to the constitutionality of Section 301 (a) under Article 3 of the Constitution, which would arise unless the sections were given substitute content.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.455" offset="12481181">And upon the Court's reluctance to give its substantive content as Justice Frankfurter put it in that case to work out without more a federal code, governing collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.736" offset="12534366">However in Lincoln Mills, the Court did face the constitutional issue and it held that Section 301 (a) was not only jurisdictional but empowered the Court to fashion a federal common law for collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.443" offset="12601135">That develop was continued in the arbitration cases and in the cases at the last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.501" offset="12625377">And I think that the development of that common law of collective agreements makes it clear that Westinghouse has no lingering validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.160" offset="12668008">Finally, even if Westinghouse held as the respondent contends it should and even if it were good law, it is very doubtful that it would win the case for the respondent, because the contractual clause suit on here is not uniquely personal to employees in the sense of the clause in Westinghouse clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.577" offset="12769677">As I said, it is plainly for the benefit of the union as an entity and for the protection of the union as well as of the individual employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.572" offset="12809697">So that on any rational, surely the union suit to enforce it and could have sued under 301 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.167" offset="12839999">So that even according to respondent's own contentions, federal law would control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.695" offset="12870196">Now, sets for a number of reasons, we think that federal and not state substantive law is controlling.</text>

            <text syncTime="3679.463" offset="14821230">So far as this record is concerned, its views are unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.141" offset="14839933">It was commenced after the six months period provided in Section 10 (a) for the filing of charges had elapsed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3916.940" offset="15771146">We have here gentlemen a situation where this Court is asked to create a concurrent and independent jurisdiction over conduct which is cognizable before the Board as an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.833" offset="15862680">It is said that this is different because it's a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3945.040" offset="15883577">I submit that this is a difference in form and not in substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3952.822" offset="15914611">If the petitioner is correct then we have a situation where we have a raise of diligence as was mentioned in connection with the Railway Labor Act cases, with one party running to the Board perhaps and another party running to the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.818" offset="15990680">We have a situation where we are injecting the courts into an area totally foreign to them, where they will be asked to give a secondhand reading to Board decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.209" offset="16052224">We are bypassing the procedures and the practices which Congress established specifically as stated in Garner to develop these peculiar distinctive rights which we find in Section 8 and Section 7 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.563" offset="16145638">We find nothing I submit if it is carefully examined in the legislative history that indicates this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.632" offset="16181896">The principle argument for the proposition that this is so is that Congress and specifically Senate Bill 1126 included the provision which would have made a breach of contract and unfair labor practice, cognizable by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.042" offset="16271548">This was also true of Section 301 or its antecedent I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.696" offset="16302164">So that under the Senate Bill as proposed, we would have had two remedies; one before the Board and one before the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.326" offset="16348662">Eventually as a result of conference this was dropped and as a House Conference Report decided, my Brother Harris quoted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.947" offset="16395160">It chose to leave the matter to the usual processes of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.434" offset="16417102">I think in this connection that there is a significant statement which unfortunately I've been trudging through the legislative history for a month or so now and I did not find at the time I wrote my brief but I would like to call it to the attention of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4099.600" offset="16501739">And that is the remarks of Senator Taft explaining the conference agreement which to me is of equal if not more significance than the House Conference Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.553" offset="16569553">He had this to say, it appears in the congressional record of the Senate, June 5th, 1947 and can be found in Volume 2 of the legislative history of the Taft-Hartley Act, Government Printing Office at page 1539.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.917" offset="16647084">He says this in pertinent part, when the bill passed the Senate, it also contained a sixth paragraph in this subsection, Section 8 (a) (6) which made it an unfair labor practice for an employer to violate the terms of a collective bargaining agreement or the terms of an agreement to submit a labor dispute to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.904" offset="16746977">The House conferees objected to this provision on the ground that it would have the effect of making the terms of every collective agreement subject to interpretation and determination by the Board rather than the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.729" offset="16818239">The Senate conferees ultimately agreed to its elimination as well as the deletion of a similar provision contained in sec -- subsection 8 (b) (5) which governed the unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.207" offset="16864214">The provisions of the Senate amendment which conferred the right of action for damages upon a party aggrieved by a breach of a collective bargaining contract however were retained in the conference agreement, that Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.807" offset="16926595">If both provisions had remained, there would been -- have been a probably conflict of remedies and decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.666" offset="16962017">And if you study the minority report in the House, you will find that this was one of the principal objections of those opposing in the House, this proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.242" offset="17016351">So that we now have this peculiar situation, the Senate Bill would of course have been a part of the federal law reviewable by this Court and any diversities and conflicts between the Board's interpretation of a contract and the Court's interpretation of a contract under Section 301 would have been reviewable by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.284" offset="17108511">Nonetheless, Congress decided that this was not right because of the possibility of conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.029" offset="17135470">And yet in this case, gentlemen, what this petitioner seeks is to vest jurisdiction concurrently in the Board under the guise of breach of contracts and we will have even though it is reviewable because controlled by sub-federal substantive law or part of 301, we will have the same confusion and conflict and we will have it many times over because we will have the trial courts throughout the country state and federal open to every litigant regardless of amount, regardless of diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.445" offset="17289174">And we say that this is not something that the contract or rather that the Congress considered a desirable result.</text>
            <text syncTime="4307.873" offset="17334836">Now, I would like to also make it clear that our contention is very narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="4313.275" offset="17356466">We only seek the result which we do in those cases where the collective agreement by reference paraphrase or what have you incorporates into the contract an unfair labor practice where the Board can give relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.972" offset="17431280">We have no sympathy for the use of pre-emption in the contract action as a complete defense to any liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.859" offset="17462836">We do not suggest that our responsibility be avoided.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.338" offset="17480704">All we seek is to channelized into the expertise and knowledge of the Board, matters that are as clearly an unfair labor practice as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.566" offset="17525635">We do not attempt to unseek arbitration because we believe if this case were to fall because this Court felt that arbitration would be affected then we would withdraw because all of us who work in that labor field have a growing respect for arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.618" offset="17613824">It is a peculiar institution, it is favored by Congress, it is favored by the courts, and more importantly, it has been favored by the Board since its inception.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.198" offset="17668159">As the Solicitor General points out in his brief, the Board has always had an attitude of accommodation towards arbitration, in fact, has insisted upon it in many occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.764" offset="17722389">So that we do not feel that the reach of our argument affects arbitration and of course, there is no arbitration present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.455" offset="17781217">What is the practical effect?</text>
            <text syncTime="4422.460" offset="17793233">They say, "No, it doesn't affect the Board's jurisdiction as such."</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.033" offset="17807548">That is certainly so, it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4428.585" offset="17817684">But it encourages every employee in such a situation to bypass the Board and how can the Board effectuate public policy if you provide another forum and say to that employee, “Here is another place to go.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.105" offset="17879751">Perhaps they are more receptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4447.687" offset="17894170">Its forum shopping, that's what it is as far as I'm concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4452.808" offset="17914650">And it substitutes as I have said for the Board's expertise and knowledge, a state court's ignorance and secondhand reading of the Board's decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="4506.482" offset="18129272">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court we were discussing pre-emption and I had about concluded my remarks on the practical effect of the petitioner's position it adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4522.160" offset="18191966">I want to make it clear so that there will be no misunderstanding that in our opinion, we have here a parallel remedy and a parallel right to appear before the Court and before the Board and that the relief would have been the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="4535.475" offset="18245256">In other words, if the petitioner could have gone to the National Labor Relations Board and it is conceded that he would've secured the same relief instead he waited beyond the statutory period before going to -- before commencing his lawsuit and he never did go to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4553.889" offset="18318921">Now, I would like to discuss very briefly Dowd Box and Lucas Flour.</text>
            <text syncTime="4557.857" offset="18334804">It is the petitioner's argument that Dowd Box considered this exact situation such as most certainly not the case if one reads the briefs and considers the argument of Mr. Feller at the last term in Dowd Box.</text>
            <text syncTime="4575.950" offset="18407215">That was a true collective right that was being enforced by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.868" offset="18430830">In fact, it involved the entire validity of the agreement which the company claimed was void by a reason of lack of authority in the negotiators.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.875" offset="18478895">And, naturally the union was -- had a perfect right under 301 to assert the contract's validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.295" offset="18516511">There followed a wage increase which had been included in the contract as negotiated, and there was a relief given as to that but that was an incidental part of the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.514" offset="18573458">The suit was for enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4619.725" offset="18582235">The alleged unfair labor practice was a refusal to bargain and we know from the insurance agents case that the Board is in no position whatsoever to grant the same relief as the Court using its equity powers in Massachusetts which was done in Dowd Box.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.165" offset="18668022">So that -- and another thing, there was no disagreement in that case about pre-emption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.242" offset="18704384">If you will read the petitioner's brief again, you will find that the petitioner claimed that pre-emption did not apply to a 301 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4663.404" offset="18756942">He agreed with Mr. Feller.</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.689" offset="18766137">What he did say was that it applied solely on the federal court because 301 confined jurisdiction exclusively to the federal courts so that the pre-emption wasn't argued either.</text>
            <text syncTime="4678.659" offset="18817964">As to Lucas Flour we had no unfair labor practice at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4683.234" offset="18836355">It was a claim -- the claim of the union in that case as a means avoiding liability altogether that the right to strike was arguably protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4694.253" offset="18880345">There is a statement to the effect that it was arguably prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.386" offset="18892884">I don't quite understand that and I don't think Mr. Oles who argued for Lucas Flour in that case understood it either.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.528" offset="18925484">But in any event, the pre-emption rule as claimed by the respective parties in Dowd Box and Lucas Flour is not our case because in those cases most certainly the Board was not in a position to grant relief and couldn't have granted relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4730.710" offset="19026213">And before leaving, well I should say I've one other remark to make and that is that this contract argument is deceptively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="4741.192" offset="19068113">In our case, the Government brief says that pre-emption should not apply to a contract action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4750.098" offset="19103744">Our Brother Harris admits that this is not so if substantive state law controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.482" offset="19133315">The Government, through the Solicitor General, has several reservations about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.728" offset="19166333">He says this is right in this case but it is wrong as he says in his footnote at page 25 -- rather in his footnote at page 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.921" offset="19239058">It is wrong if the contract includes a sweeping -- I think, to use his exact words -- no, he uses this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4806.439" offset="19329128">He says if the bargaining agreement merely adopted as such a wide range of obligations imposed by the National Labor Relations Act, imposed statutory duty to bargain collectively and so forth, then this would be a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.677" offset="19398092">This is a different case and degree but I submit to the Court that it's no valid distinction because Section 8 (a) (3) equally requires the expertise and knowledge of the Board as if you included in Section 7, Section 8, and the duty to bargain collectively, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.559" offset="19481579">And in Section 20 -- I mean on page 25 in his footnote, he refers to another exception and these are cases in which the Board has appeared and the claim is a contract claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.342" offset="19540720">It involves recognition, a standard part of every contract which says that the union is the exclusive bargaining agent but suddenly the union loses the majority of the employees who's -- choose to be represented by another employer and the -- or rather another union and then the union who's been unseated brings an action in Court on 301 to enforce the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.221" offset="19648240">The Solicitor General says that here he feels that there ought to be determined by the courts to the expertise and knowledge of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4898.145" offset="19695992">I agree -- oh, I think all we disagree on is whether or not we ought not to defer to the expertise and knowledge of the Board in this area where the contract incorporates Section 8 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.425" offset="19749073">To us it's equally important.</text>
            <text syncTime="4917.262" offset="19772374">Now, as a selectee -- as a suggested solution and one supported by the reasoning of this Court in the Railway Labor Act cases and by Anson versus Hiram Walker cited in our brief which was a decision by the Seventh Circuit denied review by this Court, we feel that it should be required of an individual employee with a remedy before the Board to go to the Board first and that if the Court is approached on the same theory of exhaustion of administrative remedies, that the Court insist that he go to the Board first.</text>
            <text syncTime="4966.383" offset="19968920">If the Board refuses to take jurisdiction or will not issue a complaint, then he's in the position to go back to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4975.775" offset="20006431">If the Board on the other hand takes jurisdiction as it most certainly would have in this case I think, then that's the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.362" offset="20040808">And this is suggested in the Railway Labor Act cases such as Slocum versus Delaware and Order of Railway Conductors in 339 U.S. where the courts were denied the right to act where the employee had not, where the union had not gone to the Railway Adjustment Board to seek relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5012.460" offset="20153240">They insisted -- it was insisted by this Court in those cases that that be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.367" offset="20172884">Otherwise, this raise of diligence would follow and there'd be a result in conflict at least potentially.</text>
            <text syncTime="5026.172" offset="20208097">And with that I would like to pass to the question of Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="5034.018" offset="20239444">As we see it, our argument is -- maybe summarized in this manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5041.127" offset="20267865">We think that Section 301 is the basis for this federal labor law which the Court enunciated in Lincoln Mills that this Section grants rights, federal rights so to speak from which this Court is free to fashion a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5064.021" offset="20359502">The question is what are these rights and what is the reach of this statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="5070.404" offset="20384998">And does it apply to a suit by an individual employee for back pay?</text>
            <text syncTime="5076.170" offset="20408090">And if it does not, what is the applicable substantive law, state or federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.438" offset="20441109">And so I think in our quest for an answer, we start with Westinghouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="5091.851" offset="20470784">Westinghouse of course was by -- there was no majority opinion in Westinghouse but the feeling I think of those in the majority was that these were uniquely personal or individual rights and that Congress did not contemplate in the legislative history of Section 301, a grant of jurisdiction to the federal courts over suits by individual employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5118.860" offset="20578826">This has a sound legislative basis because we find consistent references to the flood of litigation which would result, the fact that federal judiciary was then vastly overburdened and still is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5135.951" offset="20647163">And furthermore we find only two references.</text>
            <text syncTime="5139.526" offset="20661478">At least, I have only been able to find two references to individual employee actions in the entire legislative history of Section 301 and the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.534" offset="20705468">One is -- was referred to my -- by my Brother Harris a question by Representative Barden answered by Representative Hartley.</text>
            <text syncTime="5163.178" offset="20756041">This is the only one of significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5165.677" offset="20766072">It appears in Lincoln Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="5171.458" offset="20789164">It doesn't seem to have any particular significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5175.926" offset="20807032">It's a long question perhaps misunderstood.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.676" offset="20818108">The other was a remark by Senator Taft in which he, referring to Section 301 said that it granted rights to the employers and the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.578" offset="20857710">He obviously misspoke himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5191.016" offset="20867427">He meant the union not the employees because he didn't even mentioned a labor organization or the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.625" offset="20901909">Westinghouse established this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5202.170" offset="20912044">Westinghouse is no longer law as to the constitutional questions which bothered Mr. Justice Frankfurter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5209.979" offset="20943287">Lincoln Mills settled that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.924" offset="20955094">But if we have Westinghouse in (Inaudible) of history by reason of Lincoln Mills then I failed to see why this Court was so careful to distinguish Westinghouse as it did in Lincoln Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.254" offset="21028342">And Mr. Justice Harlan, joining in the occurring opinion made it plain that his concurrence was on the basis that Lincoln Mills involved the enforcement of a collective right and not a uniquely personal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="5246.219" offset="21088214">So that was -- to me at least the status of Westinghouse and how was it -- as it appeared to the lower courts since.</text>
            <text syncTime="5255.835" offset="21126666">I have reviewed the lower court decisions and of our ten circuits plus the District of Columbia, there have been -- this question has been raised in nine out of 11, in nine out of 11 cases have followed Westinghouse and said that an individual has no right to sue under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="5282.359" offset="21232828">This incidentally was a situation in the case heard by this Court at the last terms, Zdanok versus Glidden from the Second Circuit, a suit by individual employees and considered to be without the purview of Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="5300.066" offset="21303672">Every court has consistently said in these cases that they were dependent upon diversity and necessary jurisdictional amount.</text>

            <text syncTime="5451.090" offset="21907728">In any event that's been the status of the matter in the local courts so that I can't conclude the Dowd Box or rather the Westinghouse has yet in the dustbin of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.686" offset="21954121">Now we come to Dowd back -- Box and that puts it in the dustbin of history.</text>

            <text syncTime="5478.301" offset="22016606">It did at the end because the other questions have become moot as I recall it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.863" offset="22038862">But as initiated in the Massachusetts Court, it was a collective right that the union claimed to enforce just as much as the right to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5494.482" offset="22081285">And of course, in Lincoln Mills we wound up with an arbitration concerning back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.244" offset="22108348">But the assertion of the federal right which Congress found a desirable method in which Lincoln Mills decided was a right considered by Congress within the meaning of Section 301 and equally with Dowd Box.</text>
            <text syncTime="5518.926" offset="22179088">Now coming to Atkinson, I must confess at more difficulty with Atkinson for the simple reason that it's premised on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="5529.775" offset="22222451">I think that the majority through Mr. Justice White in discussing count 2 of Atkinson where the jurisdiction was based on diversity said it was sufficient if the complaint on its face showed an alleged violation of a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5556.450" offset="22329135">But Mr. Justice White then went on to consider the second ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="5561.854" offset="22350764">And the second ground involves the only substantive law to be found in Section 301 in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.631" offset="22397889">And that is the vicarious responsibility of the union and the exculpation of the union member from liability to the -- end that, there would be no repetition of the Danbury Hatter situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5589.622" offset="22461837">Congress was unanimous in this view both majority and minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="5594.684" offset="22482108">They wanted to end any possibility of a union member being liable.</text>

            <text syncTime="5813.362" offset="23356792">Now, I would also like to mention that Congress as I think many have observed considered only collective rights and for that matter, as Lincoln Mills -- the briefs in Lincoln Mills may claim, the main thing that they consider was the no-strike clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5837.551" offset="23453550">And they also considered arbitration rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5841.179" offset="23468074">In considering the breach of contract, is an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5846.055" offset="23487613">They considered these collective rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5849.446" offset="23501197">They -- at no point except these two references that I have noted referred to individual rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5858.585" offset="23537664">And in fact, the contrary it was noted I think by Secretary Schwanbach (ph) testifying before the Committee that individuals had always been able to sue and of course, Congress at that point was concerned with the suability of unions as an entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5877.560" offset="23613628">This was a problem with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5879.799" offset="23622614">There was of course no problem with the suit by an individual, nor has there ever been to my knowledge in the state such a problem on one theory or another, be a third party beneficiary what have you traditionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5894.364" offset="23680815">Individual rights have been enforceable whether it's for seniority or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="5900.213" offset="23704221">So that there was no necessity felt, I would assume by Congress for dealing with these rights or trying to affect these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5912.687" offset="23754167">Instead they left as they said, the House Conference Report said in rejecting the Senate amendment on breach of contract as an unfair labor practice, we leave this to the usual processes of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5926.248" offset="23808397">Well, these processes become -- I submit respectfully quite unusual if petitioner's argument is acceptable because they're going to have displaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="5938.769" offset="23858448">In Michigan I know our entire substantive body of law developed over 40 or 50 years in the sense that it will only exist if it is compatible with this so-called federal common law.So that we do have a problem in federalism, we lack any clear intent from the congressional history or the legislation indicating that Congress intended to usurp the States in the exercise of these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5978.952" offset="24019153">And I become frankly quite lost in this area in many respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="5986.334" offset="24048724">Because normally, I think of legislation, federal legislation as creating rights in the sense of a statute to which you can look.</text>
            <text syncTime="5997.808" offset="24094595">This is not so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6000.215" offset="24104208">We do know however that the federal rights created under Section 301 which we construed to be the right of the union or the employer to sue for breach of agreement, does give the Court's power to fashion a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6015.442" offset="24165125">But we say that it is -- that the scope of this law is limited to the jurisdictional scope of Section 301 because that's where the federal laws came from so to speak from these federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6031.237" offset="24228342">And to indicate why we feel difficulty in this area, we compare New York Central versus Winfield with the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6048.317" offset="24296678">That case involved the reach of the Federal Employers Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6058.124" offset="24335862">And in that case, Congress directed the code of regulation though it's comprehensive and it was based on negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6067.907" offset="24375045">The New York legislature passed the Workmen's Compensation Act which did not require a showing of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6077.578" offset="24413706">And in that case, the question was whether or not a railroad employee could sue under the employer's lia -- could sue or recover under the Workmen's Compensation Act being covered by the Employer's Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6095.489" offset="24485282">The answer of the Court was no but when you look at the legislative history of the Federal Employer's Liability Act as Mr. Justice Bender said, you find that the legislator -- legislature that Congress considered this very point and rejected the idea of imposing liability without negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6119.526" offset="24581517">And even then Mr. Justice Brandeis despite this legislative history would have permitted the New York courts to apply the Workmen's Compensation Law because it was not in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="6133.463" offset="24637210">Here, by virtue of this federal law, common law, the breadth of which we do not know and have no idea of, we have now displaced all law in the area of collective bargaining agreements and industries affecting commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="6152.982" offset="24715264">And they maybe utilized, that is the state decisions maybe utilized only as they are consistent with federal decisions so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6160.271" offset="24744417">As a practitioner, we are left without guidelines or means of determining what law applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6169.128" offset="24779839">That is exactly petitioner's position as to the reach of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6174.934" offset="24803140">On the contrary on the Railway Labor Act which some people have said as a state -- within the state and subject to the breath of legislation contained in the Railway Labor Act, this Court didn't reach this conclusion because in Moore and Kopel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6195.831" offset="24886732">The cases where the employees were discharged what law applied there?</text>
            <text syncTime="6202.269" offset="24912436">It was state law said this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6205.588" offset="24925706">In the case of Moore it was a state statute limitation and in Kopel it was the state rule regarding exhaustion of internal remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6215.083" offset="24963741">And I submit that the Railway Labor Act proposes this comprehensive regulation as does the National Labor Relations Act with regard to collective agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="6227.196" offset="25012120">And going through the entire history of -- not the entire history but many of the cases which have considered whether or not state law applies under various (Inaudible) types of federal legislation, I found no instance where the Court has displaced state law unless there is a comprehensive regulation and a probability of conflict not just a possibility of conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="6262.079" offset="25151718">So we submit to the Court that whether this be an action based on Section 301 or not and whether or not the federal substantive law applies that nonetheless if there's to be centralized coherent administration of the Act and not duplicate remedies, forum shopping and the like that this Court will following -- the reasoning of other situations require an individual employer to resort the Board first and the Court to defer to the Board where its expertise and knowledge is evaluated in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6310.218" offset="25344293">And we will ask -- we respectfully suggest that this is the best remedy for obtaining centralized administration of Title 1 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6324.212" offset="25400195">We also -- and if this would be so if we are right in this contention, then there's no necessity for considering the reach of federal law under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="6336.240" offset="25448364">On the other hand, if in the Court's opinion pre-emption does not apply in a Section 301 action, then the reach of Section 301 becomes important because as my Brother Harris agrees I believe, if substantive law does not control, that is federal substantive law does not control this action then pre-emption does apply even though it is a contract action.</text>
            <text syncTime="6364.339" offset="25560691">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="6371.127" offset="25587858">I would like if I may to give the Court a concrete illustration of why it is that we are anxious to preserve the concurrent arbitral and judicial remedy even in situations where we could go to the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="6393.353" offset="25676779">In 1955 there was a long invidious strike against the Southern Bell Telephone Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="6401.913" offset="25711052">At the end of that strike, the strike settlement agreement provided as it very often does, that the employees who had been discharged by the company some 226 employees had been discharged during the strike for alleged misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="6422.090" offset="25791718">The settlement agreement provided that these 226 discharges would be submitted to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="6430.987" offset="25827349">The arbitration took several weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="6434.640" offset="25841977">In the end a majority of the employees were put back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="6439.521" offset="25861413">The next year, 1956, there was a strike at Cowler.</text>
            <text syncTime="6446.134" offset="25887953">Some 60 employees were discharged for alleged misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="6452.577" offset="25913657">The issue of the reinstatement of those 60 employees at Cowler is still before the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="6462.574" offset="25953677">In fact, the end is not yet in sight.</text>
            <text syncTime="6467.515" offset="25973426">That is why we are so anxious to preserve the arbitral remedy and we see no way of distinguishing between arbitration and damage suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="6480.166" offset="26023999">Now, our counsel for respondent mentioned the case of Glidden Company against Zdanok, Z-D-A-N-O-K.</text>
            <text syncTime="6490.592" offset="26065690">That case of course was before this Court last year only on a quite different point, the right of a court of claims judge to sit on the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="6500.853" offset="26106755">It does however, I agree illustrate very well the problem as to the reach of the federal common law of labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6513.305" offset="26156596">That was a plant closing case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6516.089" offset="26167777">The employer closed a plant in Long Island and shifted the work from there into another plant in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="6526.770" offset="26210408">The union tried to take the -- tried to compel arbitration in the New York States courts but the suit was dismissed on the ground that the contract covering the Long Island plant had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="6542.674" offset="26274043">Then individual employees sued in the federal court on diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="6550.372" offset="26304867">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in their favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="6555.174" offset="26324093">It held that their seniority rights under the expired contract covering the Long Island Plant attached to the other plant in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania that they were entitled to go to work in the Pennsylvania Plant with their old seniority rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6575.005" offset="26403401">The majority of the Second Circuit held that New York substantive law controlled on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6582.775" offset="26434435">Judge Lumbard dissenting said, “No, this is a thing on which there should be a uniform federal principle and federal substantive law should control.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6595.664" offset="26486053">And I submit that that case perfectly illustrates that federal law should control.</text>
            <text syncTime="6603.364" offset="26516877">In other situations where a plant closes, it is quite often for a union to enter into an agreement as to the consequences of a closing, severance play, employment rights at the new plant and so forth whether that is done even according to the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6622.715" offset="26594200">Federal substantive law would control because -- the enforcement of the agreement as to the consequences of the closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6631.670" offset="26630040">Surely it would be absurd to have federal law control in the one situation and state to common law control in the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="6765.463" offset="27165236">One is this very short statute of limitations with the Board six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="6770.776" offset="27186448">The other is that the party has no absolute right to institute a proceeding before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="6776.587" offset="27209749">That right is vested only in the General Counsels of the Board so that there is not a really true choice of remedies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6785.710" offset="27246216">Even so, I think that there are some situations even which where as I contend the Court has jurisdiction that it should say that it would prefer to leave this to the Board, just as the Board now quite frequently or refuses to handle issues of contractual interpretation even within its jurisdiction on the ground that they are better handled by arbitration.</text>
