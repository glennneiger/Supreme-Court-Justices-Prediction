            <text syncTime="30.779" offset="226513">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.277" offset="240515">This case is on somewhat unlikely six cases which have preceded it this week and that here, arrest have been made for conduct on city property, city park property, managed by a city department but it is similar to those other six cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.697" offset="330167">And that here again, the police are engaged in enforcing segregation customs as if they were an extension of or part of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.229" offset="376247">This case is before the Court on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Georgia brought by six young Negro men from Savannah, who were convicted of the crime of unlawful assembly under Section 26-5301 of Georgia Code, that statute which appears on page 2 of our brief punishes any two or more person who assemble and this is the key language, assemble for the purpose of disturbing the public peace or committing any unlawful act and fails to disperse on the command of peace officers, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.602" offset="561821">The petitioners were charged under an accusation filed substantially in the statutory language for assembling at Daffin Park in Savannah, Georgia for the purpose of disturbing the public peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.491" offset="629321">No reference was made in the accusation to the second clause relating to committing any unlawful act.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.168" offset="664012">And petitioners were convicted in the City Court of Savannah by a jury and sentenced to fines or to imprisonment in default of payment of the fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.767" offset="726392">On appeal, their convictions were affirmed by the Supreme Court of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.084" offset="755754">In the courts below and here, we contend the petitioners have asserted due process claims that they were convicted without evidence of their guilt and convicted under a vague statute which denied them due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.091" offset="827747">I think it's important to look at the facts in some detail because of the no evidence claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.177" offset="864110">The four witnesses testified at the trial in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.559" offset="881560">Two of them were -- only two of them were witnesses to the incident which led to the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.383" offset="904861">They were the two arresting officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.975" offset="915310">The other two people who have testified were police sergeant who came upon the scene after the arrest had been made and the head of the city park department who wasn't there at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.578" offset="965674">It had no contact with the petitioners whether a witness to the incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.048" offset="979571">He didn't know about it until after.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.668" offset="994095">So that the facts I'm giving you, the arresting officers' version of what transpired and I submit that it demonstrates completely that the petitioners are guilty of no criminal acts of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.666" offset="1066088">Now, on January 23rd, 1961 at about two o'clock in the afternoon, police officers Thompson and Hillers were on duty in Daffin Park which is a 50-acre recreational park which as I have said is managed and operated by the City of Savannah.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.742" offset="1138291">They were in their currently --</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="260.713" offset="1146232">This is owned and operated by the City of Savannah?</text>

            <label>Mr. James M. Nabrit, III</label>
            <text syncTime="265.807" offset="1166608">I understand that that is the fact, Your Honor, and that there's no dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.050" offset="1183535">The testimony of the park manager at page -- beginning at the bottom of page 42, indicates that he is the superintendent of the recreational department of the city and as superintendent, he is overall the pick playgrounds in the city and later on in his testimony, he lists them and mentions the Daffin Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.316" offset="1296593">There's no explicit statement about ownership but it's never been contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.414" offset="1317073">And I'm sure that the city attorneys will confirm that.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.012" offset="1335463">Now, where officers Thompson and Hillers were approached by a person who was identified only in the record as a white lady, and she is, according to Officer Thompson's testimony supposed have told them that there were colored people playing basketball in the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.630" offset="1413935">And Officer Thompson made it clear that as soon as he heard this, he pres -- he and his fellow officer preceded immediately to the basketball court.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.651" offset="1449984">He said, “I did not ask this white lady how old these people were.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.451" offset="1465135">As soon as I found out these were colored people, I immediately went there.”</text>
            <text syncTime="345.108" offset="1483839">And when Officers Thompson and Hillers got to the basketball court, they found the six petitioners playing basketball.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.070" offset="1523649">Both officers agreed that that was all it was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.871" offset="1542875">Officer Hillers' testimony at page 50 says, “When I arrived, the defendants were playing basketball.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.364" offset="1572864">They were not necessarily creating any disorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.573" offset="1581641">They were just shooting at the goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.750" offset="1590418">That's all they were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.732" offset="1594284">They weren't disturbing anything.”</text>
            <text syncTime="375.822" offset="1606614">And Officer Thompson's testimony at page 41 is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.280" offset="1624482">He said that at the middle of the page, “I've observed the conduct of these people when they were on the basketball court and they were doing nothing besides playing basketball.”</text>
            <text syncTime="390.460" offset="1665233">He goes on to say, they were normally playing basketball and no children around.</text>

            <text syncTime="398.324" offset="1696684">In the earlier point in his testimony, Mr. Justice Black, he had mentioned that there were schools in the neighborhood.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.493" offset="1729390">That the schools let out at about 2:30 in the afternoon and that at that time, the children usually came to this area to play but that this was about two o'clock.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.522" offset="1869511">The city in its brief in this Court makes an argument about a park rule or a claimed argument that this facility was for children and not for adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.707" offset="1918203">This was something that was never relied upon by the arresting officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.473" offset="1941295">Again on page 41, the officer expressly disclaimed any reliance on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.751" offset="1978389">At the end of that first paragraph -- the first paragraph which starts on the page, Officer Thompson said, “I have never made previous arrests in Daffin Park because people played basketball there.</text>

            <text syncTime="1606.350" offset="6528815">He said then further on the bottom of the page the playground areas, in further explaining, the playground areas are basically for young children, say 15 to 16 and under along that age group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.786" offset="6570506">We give priorities to the playground to the younger children over the grownups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.731" offset="6586284">It made no difference as to whether they were white or colored.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.624" offset="6601853">Anytime that we requested anyone to do something and they refuse, we would ask the police to stop -- it says stop and it's a misprint should be step.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.786" offset="6634559">If we would ask them to leave when they did not, we would ask the police to step in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.791" offset="6650546">We have other reports of colored children who have played on the park extension but they were never arrested or told to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.671" offset="6674056">He further -- he referred earlier at the course that they had played in the Daffin Park area and not been arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.410" offset="6701014">The facts in this case showed that these defendants were grown men, the youngest of which was 23 years of age and the oldest of which was 32 years of age.</text>

            <text syncTime="1683.963" offset="6839254">That came into the intent because the defendants constantly said they were just merely there for the purpose of playing basketball.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.794" offset="6862555">And we said the intent was not to play basketball and although, they've denied this all the way down up to this Court, in their brief in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.545" offset="6893589">They say that perhaps it was not to play basketball but to make a profound nonverbal expression against segregation in public parks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.396" offset="6932982">That's the way they put it so that in order to come into a question of free speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.041" offset="6951581">However, Mr. Hagan further along with his testimony, said that he further testified that if there were conflict between the younger people and the older people using the park facilities, the preference would be for the younger people to use them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.206" offset="7012185">But the -- we have no objections to all the people using the facilities if there are no younger people present or if they are not -- or if they are not scheduled to be used by the younger people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.813" offset="7062653">He said, and this is on further direct examination, “It has been accustomed to use the park separately for the different races but I couldn't say whether or not a permit would or would not be issued to a person of color if that person came to my office in the recreational department or requested a permit to play on the courts but I don't have the opinion that it would have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.351" offset="7148753">We have never refused one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.948" offset="7155127">The request has never been made.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.341" offset="7160769">In other words, he says if they came, we would grant them but nobody has ever come and asked and so I can't say that we have done it because nobody has requested it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1800.891" offset="7306951">It is more or less left available for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.226" offset="7320325">That is the way we have our recreation set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.476" offset="7333282">In other words, at this time, this park, this playground, was reserved -- I think the evidence shows that there were two schools right across the street, was reserved for the use of these schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.634" offset="7373928">And he further said that all during the day, these people came from the various schools to play not just during recess but they had physical education activities in which they would come out and play on these playgrounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.514" offset="7409455">And that all during the day, this particular moment, they might not be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.189" offset="7424084">They would be -- momentarily they might come in the next five minutes and a policeman knew definitely that the school would be out at 2:30, and at that time, he knew the children would be coming across to play on the playground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.766" offset="7470477">And that this was -- and this policeman so testified in Court that he knew these children were coming.</text>

            <text syncTime="4140.122" offset="16663907">These were the first Negroes to play on this basketball court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.162" offset="16683969">There was some evidence that the young children had fished in Daffin Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.328" offset="16700688">But all the witnesses agreed these were the first -- no colored children had played basketball here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.359" offset="16732766">As I understand the State's argument it is that Negro is welcome in this park and has the right to play there, but he doesn't have a right to come there for the purpose of finding out if there so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.443" offset="16801102">In any event, this is a segregated park to me where the only Negroes -- segregated basketball court where they only Negroes who go there get arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="4185.725" offset="16846242">People against Galvin, a New York case was mentioned and that case involved no constitutional issue state or federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4194.048" offset="16879574">This is direction of a state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.649" offset="16889919">Now, this argument that com -- the State makes that there was a purpose to commit a breach of the peace is an intent to prove a state of mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.373" offset="16932864">It's an attempt to prove a state of mind in a case where there's no admission of such a purpose and where there are no circumstances from which you could infer such a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.781" offset="16990542">The circumstances of the State points to are, one, the fact that these are Negroes in a white neighborhood, and two, a claim that this playground was reserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4241.572" offset="17069641">Now, if the -- if you accept the State's case as a strong case that maybe somehow this area was reserved for children, you still can't get an inference of an intent to commit a crime without making an unconstitutionally impermissible use of the statute to permit someone to be punished where he didn't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.043" offset="17227525">They had no opportunity to know of this rule, that he was breaking the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.408" offset="17253021">There were no signs around that this was reserved for children.</text>
            <text syncTime="4291.657" offset="17269948">This -- there's nothing in this case, in Mr. Hagan's testimony remotely rising through the dignity of a rule or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4298.079" offset="17295653">The best you can get is that he had a personal preference, department preference unexpressed to anyone until the trial for children to use the basketball court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4311.925" offset="17351032">And there are some -- in his testimony about of it being reserved for the use of the schools he says they are more or less left available for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.503" offset="17401396">But there's no reason I think that the petitioners had any opportunity to know this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.289" offset="17420518">So the statute would be doubly vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.160" offset="17432012">Indeed, this is very reminiscent of the problem in Niemotko against Maryland where the petitioners before this Court were convicted of disorderly conduct for holding a religious meeting in a public park where the -- there was no -- and the only claim of disorderly conduct was that they were there without a permit and there was no ordinance requiring that there'd be a permit, if -- and indeed no standards for the grant of a permit but the facts are somewhat analogous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.105" offset="17591777">Now, there is a contention that because children were going to be at this park in half an hour, perhaps this is a circumstance from which you can infer a breach of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.908" offset="17667009">There's no evidence to indicate that the petitioners knew the children would be there in a half an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.446" offset="17689161">When they asked the officer by what authority -- I think I will read that testimony.</text>
