            <text syncTime="107.066" offset="531623">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_f_luce" startTime="111.138" stopTime="388.830">
            <label>Mr. Charles F. Luce</label>
            <text syncTime="111.138" offset="547924">I assume there was no complicity on part of the State on what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.027" offset="579480">The general principles which apply to this case are, I think quite clear, they'd been laid down in two cases to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.001" offset="615424">First of all, Griffin against Illinois, decided in 1956, wherein the Court said or at least the opinion of the majority of the judges -- thank you -- that destitute defendants must be afforded as adequate and appellate review as defendants who have money enough to buy transcripts.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.694" offset="714167">And secondly, the principle laid down in a subsequent case out of the same state, State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.700" offset="742170">The fact that the conclusion of the trial judge that there was no reversible error cannot be a substitute for the right to full appellate review, and I emphasize that, full appellate review, available to all defendants who can afford the expense of transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.360" offset="812805">In the Eskridge case, the trial judge upon being requested by the indigent defendant who was convicted I think in that case of a murder had given life sentence in prison, the trial judge upon passing on the request of that particular defendant for free transcript ruled that there was no substantial ground for the appeal and that justice would not be promoted by granting transcript, hence, it was not granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.171" offset="944044">This Court when the case finally got back up here many years later held that that determination by the trial court was not an adequate substitute for the full appellate review that a defendant with funds could obtain under the rules of the State of Washington and that in effect and I might add, now in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.849" offset="1038817">Let's take a look at the facts of this particular case, involving Mr. Draper and Mr. Lorentzen as applied to the principles laid down in the Griffin case and in the Eskridge case.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.536" offset="1097540">The State of Washington still, as I mentioned gives a full right of review to those who can pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.706" offset="1118229">If you have the necessary funds to purchase a transcript, you may do so, and all that you have to do then is to have that transcript certified by the trial judge, file a brief with the Supreme Court of the State of Washington and you are given a full scale review.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.909" offset="1191058">You do not have, at any stage, to convince the trial judge of the merits of your appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.788" offset="1210493">Indeed under our procedure in the State of Washington, the trial judge never gets an opportunity in the criminal case to state what he thinks of the merits of the appeal, a matter never comes before him and there's no procedure by which he can indicate his opinion to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.529" offset="1281442">Now in this particular case, the defendants having been convicted on two counts of robbery after a jury trial appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.755" offset="1330343">At the trial being without funds, they've been represented by Court appointed counsel, the same Court appointed counsel represented them upon the -- their request for a free transcript in order that they might appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.065" offset="1395649">Now, in considering the procedures followed in this case, the Court should have in mind the rules laid down by the State of Washington following the Eskridge case wherein the -- this Court held that the procedures previously followed by the State of Washington did not meet the constitutional test of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.768" offset="1490422">Following the Eskridge case, our Court laid down rules which I have set forth in full on our brief at pages 3 and 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.471" offset="1533262">In order to get the facts of this particular case straight, I would like to read these rules and then refer to the record to show wherein and how they were complied with in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.872" offset="1582895">The Supreme Court of Washington says that an indigent defendant desiring to appeal shall file an affidavit in which he set forth the fact of his indigency, among other things that an affidavit is in the record at pages 10 and 11.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="388.830" offset="1658650">Would you mind indicating (Inaudible) in arguing which of these elements do you think that should mean (Inaudible)</text>

          <turn speaker="charles_f_luce" startTime="398.186" stopTime="565.122">
            <label>Mr. Charles F. Luce</label>
            <text syncTime="398.186" offset="1696162">Yes, I will do that, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.062" offset="1711626">The rule next requires that the indigent seeking a free transcript shall specify and I quote the rule, these are quoted on page 3 of the petitioner's brief, “Shall specify the errors which he claims were committed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="416.369" offset="1768887">And if it is claimed that the evidence is insufficient to justify the verdict, this will specify what particularity in what respect he believes the evidence is lacking.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.269" offset="1808488">Now at the record, in the record on pages 10 and 11, the petitioners have set forth some 12 or 13 errors which they alleged were committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.790" offset="1854568">I won't refer to all of them, but the ones which seemed to me to be the principal ones, they alleged that evidence was admitted, that is testimony was admitted over objection improperly.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.567" offset="1901589">They alleged that exhibits were improperly admitted over objection, they alleged the trial judge with prejudice against them, and they alleged in effect that the evidence did not sustain the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.482" offset="1961253">I might say that the list of claimed errors appears to have been drawn in the penitentiary at Walla Walla.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.694" offset="1990196">I don't think a lawyer drew that list, but nevertheless, the list does cover the four points which I mentioned and some others which are slightly redundant, so that the petitioners in this case complied with the rules of the State of Washington insofar as they were able to do so, not having a transcript, well of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.523" offset="2085491">The rules go on to say that if the State is at the opinion that the errors alleged can properly be presented on appeal without a transcript of all the testimony, it may make a showing of what portion of the transcript will suffice, or if it believes that a narrative statement will be adequate, it shall so state and shall inform the Court that the narrative statement will be available to the indigent defendant who wants to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.837" offset="2198758">Now in this instance, the State did neither of these things, rather, as it appears on page 21 of the record, beginning actually on page 19, it recited in a lengthy affidavit filed by the Deputy Prosecutor who tried the case that the evidence was overwhelming of the guilt of these petitioners now before the Court, but he did not alleged that they could obtain an appellate review with something less than the full transcript or with a narrative statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.114" offset="2355806">It is simply that the prosecutor just didn't touch on it (Voice Overlap)</text>

            <text syncTime="646.307" offset="2688606">That's the -- that I think is the vice of the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.919" offset="2706996">The State had a few comments in its affidavit answering and resisting the request for a free transcript on the alleged grounds of appeal but those comments were very general.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.583" offset="2781706">For instance on page 21 of the record, the prosecutor swears in his affidavit in response to the argument that the trial judge was prejudiced, he says that he -- the prosecutor denies that there was any perjury committed or that the trial judge was in anywise prejudiced against any of these defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.852" offset="2854745">Well, that's simply a general denial.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.983" offset="2867284">Similarly with regard to the petitioners' allegation that errors had been committed in admitting testimony and exhibits, that all the prosecutor did, as appears on page 22 of the record, was to enter a general denial to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.274" offset="2928515">He says, in his affidavit, that no exhibit or testimony was improperly admitted in evidence but he does not go into the particular questions that had been objected to nor the particular exhibits that had been admitted over objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.656" offset="2994030">And nowhere, nowhere in the record that is before this Court, or that was before the Supreme Court of Washington is there a transcript of the questions that were asked objected to and testimony that was admitted over objection similarly with regard to exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="769.052" offset="3179604">The same thing would be true if the contention of the evidence failed to sustain the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.695" offset="3202173">The rules of Washington go on to say, as to what the trial court does in this proceeding where the indigent is seeking a free transcript, that the trial court in disposing of an indigent motion were statement of facts that county expense shall enter findings of fact upon the following the matters: (a) the defendants indigency where there's no issue on that and it's admitted on all sides and the Court so stated that he would have been, defendants are indigent, (b) the trial court shall enter findings of fact on which of the errors, if any are frivolous and the reasons why they are frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.190" offset="3348146">Now what did the trial court do about that?</text>
            <text syncTime="814.712" offset="3362252">On page 27 of the record we have findings at the trial court on which of the errors are frivolous.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.548" offset="3405615">And again, all that the trial court did was to enter what amounts to general denial or general statements that the allegations of error have any merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.937" offset="3447097">For example, with regard to the contention that evidence was improperly admitted, the trial judge says on page 27 -- or finds on page 27 of the record, near the bottom of Page F as to assignment of error number 7, the Court finds that the evidence offered by the State against these defendants -- well, that is not the -- that has to do with the sufficiency of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.758" offset="3558379">The finding with reference to the admission of exhibits, is B on page 27 as to assignments of error, 2 and 8, relating to identification on the list of exhibits, each exhibit would properly identify at the trial the material and relevant to the issues, and that the objection of Exhibit 2, the gun identified by the accomplice Robert Jennings, as one used in the holdup as well as the objections to the remaining exhibits offered go to the weight the jury should place upon the exhibits rather than their admissibility.</text>
