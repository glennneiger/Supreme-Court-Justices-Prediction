            <text syncTime="32.253" offset="232364">I would like to express my appreciation at the Court allowing me to appear on behalf of the State of Indiana in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.108" offset="259845">This case involves somewhat the same consideration as were involved in the previous case and to put those into a factual context, I will give a brief statement of the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.430" offset="305089">George Robert Brown, the respondent in this case is and was an indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.548" offset="329540">He was convicted in the Lake County Criminal Court in Lake County, Indiana of murder in the perpetration of a robbery in December, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.638" offset="369873">He was sentenced to die on the electric chair.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.900" offset="382934">This decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Indiana in December 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.859" offset="406758">George Robert Brown was provided with counsel and with a transcript on that appeal as all indigents are in Indiana on appeal from the original conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.985" offset="451271">He filed certiorari in this Court and it was denied in March, 1959 without prejudice to his right to file a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.691" offset="486170">He then filed his writ of habeas corpus in the District Court of the Northern District of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.023" offset="507486">This writ was denied in February, 1964 his failure to exhaust state remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.620" offset="533817">He then in went -- went back into the state court in Lake County, Indiana in the Criminal Court and filed a Writ of Error Coram Nobis.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.898" offset="566941">This was in May of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.349" offset="580733">In this Writ of Error Coram Nobis, he alleged that several deprivations of constitutional right and other rights, the main contention that he alleged whether he was -- his confession was coerced and that he was inadequately represented by counsel at his trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.458" offset="653249">The Public Defender in Indiana represented the George Robert Brown at this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.364" offset="684805">In June 1960, the Lake County Criminal Court denied his petition for Writ of Coram Nobis.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.174" offset="716048">He then sought by a writ of mandate in that court or prior to that he asked the Public Defender to represent him on an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.934" offset="747081">The Public Defender in a letter sent to George Robert Brown and reprinted in the record on pages 40 and 41, said that he could find no merit on his appeal and therefore had it declined to represent him in this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.888" offset="802879">George Robert Brown then filed a petition for mandate in the Lake County Criminal Court seeking to have that Court appoint him counsel and also to provide him with the record for appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.314" offset="848645">This petition was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.229" offset="856273">He then saw the petition for writ of mandate in the Supreme Court of Indiana seeking the same thing, in other words to have a counsel appointed and also to have a transcript provided so that he might perfect an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.675" offset="910085">This petition was denied by the Indiana Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.837" offset="922728">He again saw the writ of certiorari in this Court which again was denied in February, 1960 or in June, 1961, and again without prejudice to his right to bring a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.585" offset="977690">He filed the -- another writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for the Northern District of Indiana on June -- this was on July, in July of 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.990" offset="1007365">On July 26th, the judge of the District Court of the Northern District of Indiana ordered the Supreme Court of Indiana to grant George Robert Brown an appeal from his denial of his Writ of Error Coram Nobis on the grounds that he had been denied equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.557" offset="1097644">This order gave the Supreme Court of Indiana 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.048" offset="1111542">The Supreme Court of Indiana took no action on this case and in November of 1961 a show-cause order was issued to the State of Indiana as to why George Robert Brown should not be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.035" offset="1167548">After hearing on the show-cause order, he was ordered release but remanded back to the custody of the warden of state prison pending his appeal to pending the appeal of the State to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.138" offset="1215927">Now the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, last May, affirmed the decision of the District Court of the Northern District of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.123" offset="1247901">It is from this affirmance that the State has sought certiorari to the Seventh Circuit and it was granted by this Court last October.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.653" offset="1281964">As I have said before, George Robert Brown is an indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.356" offset="1300773">It is conceded by the State that before he can appeal in a belated proceeding such as the Writ of Error Coram Nobis or a writ of habeas corpus, he must seek the aid of the Public Defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.565" offset="1349674">This is so because of the statutes and the interpretations of the statutes by the Supreme Court of Indiana in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.506" offset="1385409">The statute is set down in our briefs states that the Public Defender -- the only method by which an indigent can obtain a transcript is if he is represented by the Public Defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.869" offset="1434833">Now, the Supreme Court of Indiana has stated that the Public Defender need not represent an indigent if he finds that there's no merit to his appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.466" offset="1469210">It is necessary for an indigent under Rule 240 of the Indiana Supreme Court to file a transcript in order to properly present any errors that he might claim on the Writ of Error Coram Nobis.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.636" offset="1989883">Now, it is this process relating to belated appeals and the appointment of the Public Defender that the two courts below in this process is peculiar to Indiana which the District Court and the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals below has found denied equal protection to George Robert Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.668" offset="2078072">I have divided my argument into three phases.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.972" offset="2099284">The first phase is a discussion of the Court's opinions below as to their finding of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.213" offset="2128227">I think it is significant that the basis of both of the decisions below was the Equal Protection Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.995" offset="2159365">At the second part of my argument is a discussion of this case as it relates to the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.876" offset="2182875">And the third phase is a discussion of this case as it relates to the federal process of providing indigents' appeals as outlined by this Court in the Coppage case.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.642" offset="2237942">As to the first argument, as I stated before I think it is significant that both of the lower court base their decision on the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.698" offset="2286216">Indiana has classified for the purposes of belated appeals indigents and nonindigents.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.764" offset="2318399">If this classification in and of itself is a denial of equal protection, then most assuredly Indiana has violated the Equal Protection Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1095.813" offset="4486666">Yet, it have a $4 filing fee before a $20 filing fee before he can even file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.578" offset="4505684">In this case, the man is always allowed to file his coram nobis or habeas corpus writ proceeds if he can't get counsel, and many times he's not represented in the coram nobis proceeding by the Public Defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.604" offset="4549778">He simply goes in there by himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.737" offset="4558346">Now there's no filing fee as to the filing of this and I can see a distinction between the thing that either attaches to the writ of habeas corpus or the similar writ in Indiana coram nobis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.426" offset="4605053">And it seems to me a less of sanctity that attaches to a man's right to appeal from the denial of one of these writs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.711" offset="4650193">In the Eskridge case which was discussed in the previous argument, I would submit that what this Court was really speaking of was due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.152" offset="4691989">And that on the grounds of due process that Eskridge is distinguishable from the case in Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.158" offset="4719992">As we've stated in our brief I don't think that it's fair to cope the trial judge but who passes on demands -- in one writ says the man has no right to a new trial and the next writ says that he can't -- he has no merit to his appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.999" offset="4791359">I think this is a far different process with a very natural inclination that judges have against being reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.375" offset="4816854">It's a different process in putting this onus on the part of the man who defended the indigent in the trial court and saying that he should initiate the appellate process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1274.561" offset="5201586">Brown had an attorney at the coram nobis hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.955" offset="5223215">His attorney said, “There was no merit to your appeal and I'm just not going to take it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1294.715" offset="5282252">So far the Public Defender or the indigent is in no different position than a man with money who went into the coram nobis petition and his lawyer represented him to the entire hearing and said there's no merit to your appeal and I'm going to drop out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.576" offset="5349648">At this point the difference does change but I would submit that it does not change in such a manner as to render the process unfair to the indigent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1963.095" offset="7955728">There is some language in there that would intimate that there was an attempt to answer this District Court's opinion but I -- just a speculation, (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.122" offset="8011839">In reaching my third argument I would just say that it seems to me that the procedure in Indiana is extremely close to the procedure that is used in the federal system is outlined in the Coppage Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.678" offset="8074115">That procedure, as I understand it, is outlined in the Coppage case is that the District Court makes the determination and that there's a lack of good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.254" offset="8112358">The convicted man appeals himself usually to the Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.525" offset="8141511">The standard there is if the proceed pleadings of that man are not clearly frivolous then they will grant him an appeal if a transcript is needed in that court to properly present the errors alleged and the transcript is provided and an attorney is appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.562" offset="8213608">There must be an attempt by that attorney -- by the attorney according to the Coppage case to show the Court that the certificate of the lack of good faith is an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.269" offset="8256449">Now, I would submit to this Court that supposing the attorney has a transcript from the lower court, it has a quite voluminous transcript and he checks through this transcript and in his opinion there is no error in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.322" offset="8312665">And he then goes into the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals and says in my opinion there is no error in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.996" offset="8339310">As I read that case, that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.654" offset="8349968">And it's this attorney's opinion that ends it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.681" offset="8366059">I submit that in Indiana that attorney already exist and he is -- have been in a very real sense already appointed by the Supreme Court of Indiana and he is actually appointed on the statute and paid by that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.947" offset="8415169">And then when he makes this determination, he is making that same determination that the attorney is in the Coppage case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.244" offset="8444322">Now, there is this distinction that the incomplete transcript is in the Circuit Court of Appeals but I don't know that it is really fair to assume that in the case of a voluminous transcript, an attorney comes in and says, “There is no error in this transcript”, that the Court will then search that transcript to find error themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.822" offset="8534706">I submit that these procedures are so close together as to there to be very little difference between the federal procedure and the state procedure, and that given this slight distinction between the two, which I do not believe, would deny an indigent in Indiana due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.693" offset="8618193">It seems to me that this Court should take a long look at the Indiana procedure in juxtaposition with their own procedure before they should overrule it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2178.094" offset="8815783">It is hardly believable to me that a hundred years later, the same court should utter an opinion such as it was written in the McCrary case after remand of that case to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2324.447" offset="9401135">We are not prepared, of course, to speak with respect to these later cases now before this Court and about which we did not know until we came here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.960" offset="9439169">The Attorney General is bound to take the position that the McCrary case fulfills all the requirements of Griffin and the cases following it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.195" offset="9484204">That is to say, the requirements of the Fourteenth Amendment whether it'd be conceived of as ground to the -- in due process or grounded in the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.220" offset="9532270">There seems to be however, a colloquy, an argument going on between the Attorney General, between his adherence and reliance upon McCrary and the adherence and reliance of the Supreme Court of Indiana on a chain situation in Willoughby, which of it becomes important I will go into it later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.326" offset="9608652">But I think that we can start with George Robert Brown's case at the same place that we can start with Mr. McCrary after he came to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.922" offset="9651075">He came to this Court and this Court reversed or set aside a dismissal of his action and remanded the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.618" offset="9689840">In the remand, this Court pointed out that Mr. McCrary had made certain allegations which this Court felt that the Supreme Court of Indiana may not have education to look into in light of the Griffin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.067" offset="9755669">So the case went back to Indiana and there the Indiana Supreme Court undertook to prepare a decision on that case on the remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.416" offset="9804988">This Court indicated that McCrary's allegations were, first, that he could not get a transcript, and second that he could not have an appeal without a transcript, and that he could not receive the aid of the Public Defender, and therefore, he could get no transcript, and that he was indigent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.255" offset="9892342">His indigence was admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.711" offset="9906239">Now, he appears -- his case appeared before the Supreme Court of Indiana on remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.761" offset="9934451">The Supreme Court of Indiana first says that the Griffin case does not apply and it uses distinctions later set aside by this Court in the Smith against Bennett case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.441" offset="9985128">So that those distinctions, it seems to me, are no longer worthy of hearing but the allegations that he made in this Court are proved to be the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.506" offset="10045419">He said in this Court, without a transcript, he could have no appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.979" offset="10067257">He said in this Court if he could not get the aid of the Public Defender, he could not get the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.671" offset="10090036">Now the Supreme Court of Indiana, having made the distinctions of which I have mentioned, having indicated that Griffin against Illinois was not applicable then proceeds to set out in its decision the precise truth of the allegations that McCrary made in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.302" offset="10180629">First, that he indicated that he was there as a pro se appellant subject to all of the rules of the Supreme Court of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.909" offset="10227022">The rules of the Supreme Court of Indiana leaving out Rule 26 with respect to bill of exceptions of sticking just with the transcript, says that, “You must have a transcript and this is a formal document signed by the court below or by the clerk below in vacation time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.922" offset="10299016">Without that, you are not here in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.178" offset="10312077">And they justified the conduct of the Public Defender saying that he must not give a transcript to anyone he does not represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.817" offset="10354604">And it was shown that the Public Defender decided not to represent McCrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.433" offset="10389086">Now, there's -- there is this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.537" offset="10409566">Well, this affidavit which I will speak in a moment about what happened to McCrary was this; he was not really in Court at the time that case was being considered upon remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.177" offset="10460035">He was standing in the (Inaudible) some place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.613" offset="10469857">And the Court was considering whether he would come in, and they said the papers, not the appeal, the papers that you've filed do not fulfill the rules and you are out of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.355" offset="10524818">They then undertook this process which -- to which my friend from Indiana has referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.879" offset="10562853">They issued a rule to show-cause upon the Public Defender.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.116" offset="10583855">He files an affidavit attaches to it apparently, the affidavit of trial counsel in the original trial of McCrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.254" offset="10632338">I'm not quite sure I understand even the ethics of this kind of an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.158" offset="10655953">This kind of a revelation by trial counsel without at least McCrary's permission but this document is then filed in the Supreme Court of Indiana with McCrary still securely locked away in the state prison, same kind of a hearing he's had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.931" offset="10739127">At the end of which without any chance on McCrary's part --</text>
