            <text syncTime="66.235" offset="368306">We saw a 19-year old colored boy in the custody of the Sheriff of Calcasieu Parish confessing by sound and by this picture to the commission of three heinous crimes: murder, aggravated kidnapping and armed robbery.</text>

            <text syncTime="94.404" offset="480946">The day before in Lake Charles in the late evening, a bank was robbed, three tellers kidnapped and taken out of town, shot, and one of them murdered with a knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.434" offset="541132">The petitioner was picked up two or three hours later, he then thereafter made oral admissions, a written confession and the following morning, in the Sheriff's office, this boy who had up to that time had been without counsel, without friends, without anyone to lean on, was made the participant as well as the record shows without his knowledge of what was happening in this movie, at which time a sound track was made by the local and only television station in Lake Charles.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.223" offset="684283">And that film which lasted for 20 minutes wherein this petitioner confessed to the commission of these crimes which shown on the 17th to approximately 24,000 people, was shown on February 18, the following day to approximately 53,000 people and was shown on February the 19th to approximately 29,000 people.</text>

            <text syncTime="584.584" offset="2441697">So, consequently, as Your Honors know, in a civil practice, a record is being made and you rely on your record.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.356" offset="2464789">In this case, as in criminal cases in Louisiana, if you're questioning a witness on his voir dire examination and then you challenge him at the end and the judge says, “Well, I won't grant the challenge.”</text>

            <text syncTime="642.006" offset="2671365">Now, one point which I think will be raised by the State on this matter of not having counsel at the time of arraignment under our law, the judge may permit an accused to withdraw pleas for the purposes of filing motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.562" offset="2737612">That was done in this case, but we would say to Your Honors even though we were aware of the Hamilton case and the case that Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice read a procurement opinion in today, I think it was on Docket Number 600.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.192" offset="2792155">Nevertheless, even if we must for some reason in this case point to prejudice, we think this, the boy's plea of guilty to the armed robbery which was a series, one series of transactions, one crime was aired in the newspaper so that consequently he was at a critical time without the benefit of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.316" offset="2876688">So later when we withdrew those pleas and we said we now enter pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity such pleas became mere lawyer's pleas.</text>

            <text syncTime="990.738" offset="4066304">With reference to the question of appointment of counsel in this particular matter, I would like to direct the Court's attention to the fact that as of the time of the arraignment, prior to the appointment of able counsel, the defendant entered a plea of not guilty to the crime of murder which is the only crime for which he has been tried and convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.777" offset="4210500">This crime of robbery, armed robbery which he had entered a plea of guilty to, in which plea the Court permitted to be withdrawn along with all other pleas has never been to trial Your Honor, only the charge of the murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="1062.712" offset="4354173">And the defendant was arraigned again with the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.123" offset="4387819">We take the position that this case differs from Hamilton, David Hamilton versus Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.074" offset="4415718">And that under Alabama law, an arraignment cannot be set aside once a man has been arraigned, there are certain rights that are irretrievably lost.</text>
