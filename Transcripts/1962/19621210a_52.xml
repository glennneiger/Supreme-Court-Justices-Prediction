            <text syncTime="45.600" offset="285759">This case presents the issue whether the filing of a proceeding to condemn lands to which the United States has legal title but as to which there may be there is asserted rights under the public domain, especially here the mining laws, deprives the Department of Interior of its ordinary jurisdiction to determine the validity of such claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.086" offset="431731">We are dealing here with the question of power of the District Court, not as to exercise the discretion I believe because as I would trace in a minute the District Court exercised its discretion in favor of permitting the administrative proceeding to proceed in a normal manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.413" offset="544998">The facts are few.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.116" offset="559835">The United States is undertaking the Trinity River project, heart of the Central Valley project in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.920" offset="591078">This is in the northernmost project.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.777" offset="606438">It has been added to the project in recent years as another feature.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.349" offset="632769">In January of 1957, condemnation proceedings were filed covering some 3000 acres of land for the purpose of that project.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.899" offset="687000">The lands were for the most part, public domain on which there were many outstanding mineral entries under the mining laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.925" offset="739035">In that proceeding, as the District Court has specifically found the right to retain administrative authority to proceed in the usual way to determination of validity of the claims was expressed expressly reserved.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roger P. Marquis</label>
            <text syncTime="235.661" offset="1046026">Well, I think it was put in the complaint simply -- so that it would not be read as an admission that all the mining claims were valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.315" offset="1084583">I don't think that was inconsistent with the specific finding that the right was retained to determine that validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.367" offset="1112795">I think there are two different things and I think it was simply making claim, which we often do in filing these complaints when for some reason or other, we have a claim but we want to condemn, in any event, to make that allegation in the condemnation case, so as to put the landowners on notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.419" offset="1205060">Actually, it isn't provided for in the Federal Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.761" offset="1222405">The Rule 71A concerning the allegations of the condemnation complaint do not contemplates any pleadings on matters except right to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.475" offset="1293249">The matters of compensation are not the matter of ordinary pleading and the form in there, as you'll see, has no provision for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.884" offset="1334941">The only provision is statutory authority to take what the purpose, what title do we -- what are we condemning and as I say, we put these allegations in there so that people won't be misled, but a lot of times the -- it's the idea, that mere filing of a complaint admits the property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.213" offset="1428250">Of course, that was the subject of a 93 Acres case, not long ago in this Court where it was held that there was no such admission or election to treat the property right as valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="538.805" offset="2258631">In the course of this discussion, I think we have summarized what the case is about and I will turn to -- first, the District Courts, it granted summary judgment for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.641" offset="2333968">On three basic ideas expressed in its opinion that invoking the principle of a court with jurisdiction over in the entire controversy, may defer its ruling, withhold action as to a particular matter while that matter is determined by some other special tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.321" offset="2448697">Second, that the Bureau of Land Management has special competency in determining, contesting claims to public lands, that the Star Chamber charged with the plaintiffs in the case had made against such procedures was unwarranted and that there was every reason to allow the agency to adjudicate these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.692" offset="2550157">Finally, he pointed out -- he said, there was no multiplicity of trials because the Court will not try the issue of validity of the mining claim which is a different, much a different issue from the validity -- from the question which -- would ultimately be presented if the claim is valid as to the amount of compensation based on market value of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.570" offset="2657677">The Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.481" offset="2669275">It expressed this idea of election and I think its one sentence on page 40 of the record epitomizes its notion.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.508" offset="2717445">No statute or controlling authority has been called to our attention, indicating that the Administrative Tribunal was in the Department of the Interior, retains jurisdiction to adjudicate the validity of mining claims after the Secretary of the Interior has invoked the jurisdiction of the District Court by the filing of a condemnation action in which has raised the same issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.832" offset="5666670">Maybe a little bit of description of this rather unusual mining law procedure would be helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.742" offset="5698330">There are three stages of the mining law procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.861" offset="5718810">First is prospect, you can prospect as long as you go peaceably and you don't get into fights about the gold claims or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.505" offset="5777429">A person can -- first goes and prospects and his possession, in his prospect is a valid right as against third parties but is no right at all, the mere prospect is no vested right at all as against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.797" offset="5846601">He discovers his mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.268" offset="5856423">The gold miners found their gold then there is the established procedure called location.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.027" offset="5887457">Whereas you put up monuments around your -- you state your claim, you file under local law in the County Recorder's Office or according to local requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.320" offset="5932701">That's one of our difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.549" offset="5937612">That's the way the thing has grown up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.862" offset="5942836">It still is true so that there's no notice on the federal records of these mining claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.236" offset="5980348">A proper discovery and location, you can then proceed to work that mine and you have a right, a vested right to that possession as against the United States as well as against the whole world.</text>

            <text syncTime="1493.602" offset="6077733">Then patent, you have to follow procedures, publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.347" offset="6096750">You have to prove what -- claims to the Bureau and go through all of that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.724" offset="6122245">Payment of $500, I believe, I meant $5 per acre, goes through all those procedures then you obtain the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.579" offset="6161638">Of course, there's a difference and it works both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.686" offset="6174072">There are attempts to use a mining claim as a basis for securing a patent when actually you're going to use the property for some other purpose once you get the fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.263" offset="6224436">That's one aspect of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.624" offset="6229870">The opposite aspect of the matter is that if you're mining, if you have a mining claim, for example, you can use the timber on their land only to the extent that it can be used and contributes to your mining operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.396" offset="6288906">You're not a general owner of the timber, had the timber, so that -- but on the other hand, people may go on, mining for years without seeking a patent for tax or other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.619" offset="6337808">Because when their concentration is on the mineral, they don't need any more right in order to mine the mineral, so that we have a variation of types of rights that may be created as against the United States in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.635" offset="6397889">So that's what I answer when I talk about title that's sort of a small answer to the matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.337" offset="6584717">Having in mind all the physical situation of the quantity, quality, the available market, what kind of mineral you're talking about, all of which gets into a very complex subject of expertness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.959" offset="6667160">The field manual, I think this is something, it's important to keep in mind in this case that when we're talking about mining laws today, where this is a real -- it's real vital today because these mining laws, as distinguished from the Mineral Leasing Act, whereby the federal properties are simply leased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.943" offset="6763186">That applies to oil and gas and coal and three or four other minerals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2593.054" offset="10475604">But turning briefly to this matter of election, as I say -- I think the finding of the District Court makes it plain that there were no intentional of election to forego the administrative jurisdiction to pass on (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.295" offset="10568600">I submit that the -- there's no basis for saying in law there was a compulsory election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.009" offset="10599424">In the 93 Acres case this Court held that there was no compulsory election or remedies when we brought a proceeding of property which we had leased and we argued alternatively, the lease was revoked and it -- if that had no right and alternatively that if they did have the right we would condemn it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.961" offset="10703182">Lower courts had held that we elected our remedy by bringing the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.074" offset="10723662">This Court refers to it and said we see no reason even justice or authority, why such a Hobson's choice either to give up our claim or to forego possession should be forced to -- should be imposed upon the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.412" offset="10793044">Here we have the same basic problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.178" offset="10828048">First, I would like to note that we're dealing here generally with condemnation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.306" offset="10848632">Its mere accident of allocation of responsibility that this condemnation case was filed by the Solicitor of the Department of Interior because it is a reclamation project, presumably no distinction can be made between cases as in Southern California filed on behalf of the Army and the Navy, Marines and the various other agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.354" offset="10944763">And certainly, there isn't any way in which you could say that those officials of those agencies waved the authority which the Secretary of Interior has under the public domain laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.289" offset="11000560">The decision would present three choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.677" offset="11026056">First, postpone the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.097" offset="11039744">Postpone possession until it claims can be adjudicated under a departmental procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.745" offset="11070360">This would certainly be prejudice of public interest in a lot of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.708" offset="11086242">Second, to secure possession in the condemnation proceedings, waive the administrative authority which would then impose on the courts the burden of determining these myriad of claims and again I think it's plain that there would be great -- considerable delay in the matter of adjudicating the matters which would of course prejudice the United States in terms of interest liability and of claims getting old if there -- as they are processed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3719.990" offset="14983293">This Court, beginning back in about 1874 determined the question of the character of a mining location upon the public domain and throughout all of the time down to the latest case, wherever that question has been in litigation and has reached this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.183" offset="15112129">This Court has held that that mining location, as long as it is a subsisting matter of record is in a state of inheritance, it may be bartered and sold as any other form of real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.070" offset="15203662">The person who owns that mining location or his successors in interest may mine that property until the mineral is totally exhausted and still never have to acquire a patent.</text>
