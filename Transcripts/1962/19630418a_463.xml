            <text syncTime="46.371" offset="288893">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.301" offset="304567">This proceeding comes from the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit by certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.169" offset="332048">It involves the specific question of whether a seaman who has brought a maintenance and cure claim appended to a Jones Act negligence claim arising out of the same incident, the same employment, and the same injuries is or is not entitled to a trial by jury of the issues relating to the maintenance and cure claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.677" offset="434030">In the Court below, it was denied to him and we are be -- on behalf of a petition on the ground that he was entitled to that trial by jury and that it was improperly denied to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.362" offset="488782">As the Court may note from the caption, the plaintiff, Mr. Andres San Martin died during the pendency of the appeal and his administrator, the Public Administrator of the County of New York was substituted and that is why the caption reads the way it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.503" offset="557432">He was alive during the time of trial and testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.859" offset="574777">Now, very briefly, the facts, as they may relate to the legal question before the Court, was that the petitioner or the intestate alleged that on November 5, 1954, while an ordinary seaman aboard the ship of the respondent, he was directed over his own objection and that of other seamen to carry a 100-pound drum of cement up an inclined gangway from the pier to the ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.307" offset="688567">But this gangway was not secure, that he -- as he was going up the gangway with this 100-pound drum of cement on his shoulder, lost his balance, wrenched his back, and suffered severe injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.322" offset="736632">At the end of the voyage in December, he left the ship with master certificate, and went to the United States Public Health Service Hospital in Staten Island, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.344" offset="776756">He was treated there, became an in-patient, and remained an in-patient until March 1, 1955, a period of about -- approximately three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.848" offset="814791">He was discharged from that hospital marked “not fit for duty” with the diagnosis of a herniated disc and another notation that he had received maximum hospital benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.992" offset="859303">He filed suit in June of 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.116" offset="871842">The case came to trial in May of 1960 in the Southern District.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.870" offset="890859">At that time, when it finally became time, that I will go into later, for the maintenance and cure testimony to be presented, the defendant's physician, orthopedic specialist, claimed that Mr. San Martin could not receive any further curative care and that when he was discharged on March 1, 1955, his condition was such that he would not benefit in any way from any further medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.246" offset="1004335">The plaintiffs, the petitioner's physician, who happened to be the former-Chief of the Orthopedic Service of the very Marine Hospital from which this man had been discharged, testified to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.093" offset="1047698">This was all to the Court alone since the jury trial had been denied on these issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="241.149" offset="1067969">The issue of being whether you'd reached the point of maximum cure, is that it?</text>

            <text syncTime="245.223" offset="1084270">And, the testimony of the petitioner's physician was that he should have received conservative treatment, received the brace, there is other medical treatment that this would not only have provided a cure in terms of relief from pain and suffering but would have removed him from the ranks of total disability which is where he remained throughout these five years and would have made him able to accept gainful employment of a non-arduous nature such as an elevator operator or an assembler of parts or things of that nature.</text>

            <text syncTime="278.611" offset="1217808">Well, it's a little longer than the normal at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.784" offset="1230555">The Southern District is much less congested now.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.130" offset="1239855">The waiting period -- my own experience, limited as it may be was -- is that, now, three years, it's the normal waiting period, approximately two years from the filing of note of issue but that can't be done until all free trial discovery is completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.149" offset="1291995">It averages about a year, I would say three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.027" offset="1303489">At that time, it was longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.943" offset="1311117">Your Honors may be familiar that numerous just -- judges have been appointed recently and that's cut down the waiting period.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.139" offset="1343927">Now, as is clear from the opinions on the record, the District Court judge decided this factual issue against the plaintiff and accepted in full the testimony of the defendant's physician that there was no curative treatment available to the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.043" offset="1415502">And so, without going to the facts anymore, now reverting to legal question, I think the record establishes that the seeking by the petitioner of a trial by jury related to some very substantial monetary issues to him, the outstanding maintenance and cure for the five years that it intervened as well as, as is noted from his complaint, he sought damages for the failure to properly pay him the maintenance and cure when it was due and of course, this Court has held many times that maintenance and cure is due when it is due, that is the very day that he is ill, the very day that he would and should receive curative treatment and does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.452" offset="1585194">And, again, this amount was substantial because the petitioner could have shown that he not only lost the $8 a day but the employment and the earnings that he would have had, had he been able to obtain gainful employment which he would've been able to obtain according to his physicians having received the medical treatment to which he was entitled and which the shipowner denied to him, although, without question, there had been a due demand by June of 1955 when the complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.683" offset="1710059">That of course, is on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.156" offset="1716015">I think, if I may speak to the facts of life, we all know that the demand in fact had been made earlier, the seaman's condition was known to the shipowner, it happened aboard the ship, he received the master certificate and they, in fact, had paid him a very small amount, some $32 in maintenance and cure in the intervening period and then had cut him off.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="422.785" offset="1794487">But that the duty -- just to verify the confusion in my mind, the duty of maintenance and cure is to pay cure up to the point of maximum cure where it -- up to the point when no more treatment would do any good.</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore H. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="497.633" offset="2093955">Well, the period that petitioner alleges would be from the time of March 1, 1955 when he no longer was an in-patient, right through to the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.640" offset="2133974">He never became an in-patient again.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.727" offset="2142229">And then we reached the problems that this Court recently noted in the Salem case of whether any amount should ever be allowed for the time after trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.235" offset="2180263">As I understand the rule, if it is very, very clear and certain as to what amount should be allowed for the period after trial, the Court may allow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.061" offset="2211610">Otherwise, it should refrain from allowing it for any period after the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.595" offset="2229791">But certainly, the claim was in May 12, 1960 when this case came for trial, something over five years of maintenance, so it was a substantial claim in addition to the other elements involved, the loss of employment and earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.282" offset="2292485">Now, on the legal issue, the question framed on the writ of certiorari, I submit that there has been literally no question that it is desirable on all of the policy considerations that a joint trial be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.574" offset="2369703">I note that -- in the briefs, we submit the writings of learned commentators and as I see it, there is not a learned commentator who has devoted time and energy and scholarship to this question but has not reached the conclusion that this is indeed the desirable result that when a Jones Act claim or when a seaman comes before a Court and relates that he has been injured, relates that negligence or unseaworthiness has caused his injury and presents all his medical testimony that the efficient affair, the proper way to proceed, if possible, would be to allow the same jury to determine what maintenance and cure payments he should receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.571" offset="2525706">And so, I will not speak at this point to any extent as to the question for what -- this is the desired result.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.656" offset="2557994">In fact, even below, the only voice of all the opinions and commentators that have spoken on the subject that has suggested that a joint jury trial should not be allowed, that it suggested that the question now before the Court should be answered in the negative is the opinion of Judge Friendly of the Circuit Court on behalf of only four of the nine members of the Second Circuit who heard this matter en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.852" offset="2654751">And even he concludes that this indeed would be desirable to have a joint jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.806" offset="2678575">In other words, the question now before this Court should be answered in the affirmative, if at all possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.972" offset="2703235">So, I now turn, if I may, to what --</text>

            <text syncTime="666.206" offset="2768227">I do, Your Honor, Mr. Justice Stewart, and the reason is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.087" offset="2787767">In fact, there was diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.125" offset="2803858">In fact, this man was a resident of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.744" offset="2822353">He was a citizen, as the record shows, either of Spain where he was born or of New York where he resided.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.892" offset="2846908">In fact, he had become a naturalized citizen in 1943.</text>

            <text syncTime="735.616" offset="3045857">A maintenance and cure claim, if diversity of citizenship exists, I submit is entitled -- it is -- they affirmed it, entitled to a trial by jury in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.198" offset="3096116">Now, I submit the following that a maintenance and cure claim may enter the federal court on one of two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.195" offset="3132165">It may approach through the exercise of the admiralty jurisdiction in Article 3 of the Constitution and 28 Title 1333, and it -- there appears as a maritime -- as an admiralty claim, historically, not entitled to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.396" offset="3204995">But a plaintiff may appear as he so desires not that way but claiming it as a common law right which would be entitled to a jury in the state court.</text>

            <text syncTime="823.473" offset="3397256">There are numerous cases cited there of this Court and it has been conclusively held that in the state courts, a trial by jury as a common law matter, is permitted for maintenance and cure claims and has been regularly allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.601" offset="3465801">I might call this attention -- the Court to its own opinions in Leon v. Galceran, in the Garrett v. Moore-McCormack case which is a more recent case, rather often quoted in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.245" offset="3508328">There was a trial by jury in the Pennsylvania Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.291" offset="3520554">It so happen that the Pennsylvania Court applied a state rule as to the burden of proof on release and this Court took the question and pointed out that they must apply the Federal Maritime Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.040" offset="3571545">But recognizing without any disapproval or question whatsoever, that it was a properly submitted question, the maintenance and cure claim is a $1000 verdict for maintenance and cure in the Garrett case in the Pennsylvania Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="892.835" offset="3674676">And I would submit that a study of this will show that, throughout the years, the state courts have allowed and grant the juries on these State -- on these maintenance and cure claims when brought as a simple claim for money in personam against the shipowner for money damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.165" offset="3751999">It is in fact the -- almost the simplest type of common law in personam claim in which the man comes in and seeks money against the shipowner, over whom he has obtained in personam jurisdiction, which was -- what was obtained here.</text>

            <text syncTime="947.162" offset="3892015">I would say this, Mr. Justice Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.653" offset="3901942">In Leon v. Galceran, decided in I think approximately 1893, the specific issue was wages, but wages is maintenance and cure.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.640" offset="3937886">There's no issue about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.220" offset="3944260">This Court has said so I think in Pacific v. Peterson, pointed out that wages consists of maintenance and cure as it were.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.186" offset="3972159">It consists of three items: maintenance, cure, and wages -- beyond our wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.918" offset="3991071">And there, it was specifically held by this Court that the claim for wages was within the savings clause, was a common law remedy, was entitled to a jury resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.547" offset="4041540">I may point now this Court's attention to the extensive scholarly discussion in Mr. Chief Justice Stone's decision in Madruga which is cited in our reply brief and there, it is comprehensively noted in the footnotes the fact -- excuse me, it's Mr. Justice Black's decision in Madruga.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.966" offset="4127222">I'm very sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.227" offset="4136312">That the jury trials were allowed on these common law claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.342" offset="4148746">Also in fact, if I may borrow from my learned adversary's brief, in the very case he cite, Henry v. Moore in which Mr. Chief Justice Stone wrote an extensive opinion and the issue there was an in rem proceeding in the state courts but in the scholarly discussion that appears there, they have numerous cases cited, a numerous discussion of all of the old law on this issue that state courts regularly treat these maritime claims and rightfully grant juries on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.848" offset="4274761">The mere fact that it is maritime does not deny a jury resolution of the issues in the state courts, and the opinion below in this Court, in the Second Circuit in this case, fully accepted that fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1462.556" offset="5953599">One of the questions is this very diversity question that has been discussed with Mr. Justice Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.988" offset="5987349">I will not yield to the temptation at this time to attempt to refute the argument on these questions that are now presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.174" offset="6028100">And I will deal solely with the question which is presented, which I'll read.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.126" offset="6059865">Question: “Does a seaman have a right to a jury trial on a claim for unpaid maintenance and cure enjoined by the claim for Jones Act negligence?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.658" offset="6106049">That is the only question that is presented to the Court here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.459" offset="6129246">Now, since maintenance and cure is basically a maritime claim, I think it's appropriate to discuss briefly the historical background and development of the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.202" offset="6212211">As this Court knows, prior to the adoption of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.687" offset="6234154">There existed in America a system of laws and these laws embodied principles of the maritime law which principles have developed from the very early ancient sea codes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.779" offset="6302490">Under the -- under this system, maintenance and cure claims were prevented or presented for adjudication and they were heard and determined without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.622" offset="6357870">The framers of the Constitution, in drafting the Constitution, had this system in mind and they adopted it and incorporated it into the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.281" offset="6424534">They not only adopted the substantive features of this maritime law, this admiralty maritime jurisdiction, but also the procedural feature which did not permit a jury trial in these maritime claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.752" offset="6490363">Now, Article 3, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution is the provision which incorporated this preexisting system and it read that the judicial power of the United States shall extend to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.068" offset="6583672">Now, in addition to Article 3, Section 2, Clause 1, the framers of the Constitution further provided in Article 3 that Congress would have the power to set up inferior federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.799" offset="6670608">And pursuant to this power, Congress set up the inferior court system under the first Judiciary Act of 1789.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.179" offset="6728077">And among other things, Congress invested these inferior courts with admiralty and maritime jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.095" offset="6763708">These courts were not common law courts or courts of general jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.995" offset="6787323">Their jurisdiction was strictly limited to what Congress had conferred upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.807" offset="6818565">Now, the language of this Act of 1789 did not show any indication on the part of Congress to change the existing maritime practice of hearing these maritime claims without a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.517" offset="6897455">All that it provided for, it preserved to suitors the right to pursue the common law remedies in the state courts which they had a right before the adoption of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.598" offset="6969762">Thus, from the very founding of the Constitution and the enactment of the first Judiciary Act, the Federal Courts had the power to hear and determine these maritime claims but only on its admiralty side where a jury was not allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.960" offset="7063176">The first Judiciary Act did not authorize the courts to give jury trials which Congress had not provided for and Congress, up to this present day has not seen fit to provide in these maritime claims, the jury trials except in two classes of cases which are not here applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.372" offset="7152828">That's the cases, so-called Great Lake cases which is 28 U.S.C. 1783, in the Jones Act case, 46 U.S.C. 688.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.562" offset="7209671">Now, the petition -- now recognizing the fact, that this Court did not have the power to try a maritime case with the jury, has asserted that because his maritime cause of action was joined with his Jones Act claim, therefore he's entitled to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.435" offset="7349164">And in doing this, he adopts the doctrine of Hurn v. Oursler, which I submit to Your Honors, is not applicable in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.455" offset="7401200">The Hurn doctrine of pendency has nothing to do with the mode of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.231" offset="7424293">It relates solely the question of jurisdiction and the authority of the federal court to decide a nonfederal claim that is appended to a federal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.497" offset="7477373">It's really a question of jurisdiction and giving access in the federal court to a state claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.129" offset="7523871">I submit to Your Honors there's no -- there's no sound basis for extending this Hurn doctrine which is limited strictly to jurisdictional and not to mode of trial, particularly in view of the fact that Congress is not seen fit to extend jury trials in these maritime claims and the Constitution certainly does not provide for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.635" offset="7633899">Now, since petitioner's maintenance and cure claim was joined in the same complaint with his Jones Act claim, it is therefore subject to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3001.016" offset="12107421">With the Court's permission, I would like to respond to a couple of points and particularly to point out the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.750" offset="12146395">The petitioner here appeared and entered the federal court through the state door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.693" offset="12170115">Granted, he had the right to come in through the admiralty door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.043" offset="12187564">He chose to come in through the state door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.600" offset="12205746">By coming in to the state door, and I'll speak in a moment of Simler v. Conner and its effects on this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.686" offset="12238137">But holding that to a side for the moment, I submit that this Court has held on numerous occasions, and I refer specifically to the decision of Mr. Justice Black in Madruga against the Superior Court of California, and noted that in admiralty matters, notwithstanding the Constitution, Article 3 seems to suggest that there is exclusive jurisdiction of admiralty matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.818" offset="12338657">What really is the fact is that there is concurrent jurisdiction of the state courts and of the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.818" offset="12378676">Accordingly, this petitioner was within his rights to claim and he is within his rights here and now to argue to this Honorable Court, that he had a state common law right, notwithstanding that it is an event that occurred on the navigable waters and is in that sense, drenched with the maritime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.416" offset="12469060">There is a common law and a long history of common law claims, notwithstanding it comes from the maritime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.758" offset="12502392">The only maritime exclusively admiralty and maritime proceeding that exists, as was held in Madruga and in other cases, are the in rem proceedings against the offending vessel or thing and in personam judgment, a suit for money is permissibly, notwithstanding that it arises from the navigable waters, a state common law claim, if it be such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.238" offset="12620361">Now, I understand the majority's opinion of this Court in Romero to be to the effect that there is a “common law” law of the maritime controllable by this Court in the sense that it must be uniform throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.405" offset="12692982">In that sense, it is nationally administered but nevertheless, in its origins, it comes from the state common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.471" offset="12725269">It was the minority ruling to apply -- the minority in Romero.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.212" offset="12744182">There'd be no question this man had a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.796" offset="12754526">He'd be in the Court under 1331 of Title 28.</text>
