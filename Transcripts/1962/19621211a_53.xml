            <text syncTime="17.476" offset="173328">This case is on certiorari to the District Court of Appeal for California.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.318" offset="208645">The petitioners were convicted of possession of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.912" offset="234977">The issue before this Court is whether the entry into the petitioners' apartment, their home, and the subsequent seizure of the narcotics, the evidence upon which they were convicted, over their objection constitutes an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of their constitutional rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="70.378" offset="384920">There is a question of the initial arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.880" offset="398921">There's a conflict in the inferences to be drawn from the evidence on that point, most certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.751" offset="446360">I think it's obvious from the record that the purpose of the entry of the police officers into the petitioner's home was for the purpose of searching the home in an attempt to find the narcotics they were looking for.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert W. Stanley</label>
            <text syncTime="104.344" offset="520756">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.688" offset="538102">At the time that the case was tried -- the reason this question arises, at the time the case was tried, I don't think there was any question about the fact that the theory of the prosecution was at the entry into the petitioners' home was for the purpose of searching.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.383" offset="612916">Nothing, unfortunately, was asked of the police offers directly what their motive is and what their purpose was of going into the home, but the only logical inference that could -- inferences that can be drawn from their conduct is that they went into the home for the purpose of searching.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.107" offset="675819">And, we do have the benefit of the questions of the prosecutor at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.061" offset="699643">For example, the question that was asked of the arresting officer was, “Tell us in sequence and detail what happened after you entered the home?”</text>
            <text syncTime="161.358" offset="748753">He said that they've got the key to the door from the manager of the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.900" offset="771009">This took 15 to 20 minutes because the manager apparently was concerned and wanted to call his lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.952" offset="807163">They told the manager that they were going into the apartment because they thought that there was some narcotics in the apartment and they wanted the key so that they wouldn't have to break the door down.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.229" offset="868289">Then after going into the home, after entering surreptitiously without any announcement of their arrival, the petitioner, George Ker, was sitting on the couch and he stood up.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.696" offset="926177">Now, the first thing that they said to him I think is also indicative in sequence and detail, exactly as the thing arose, of what their intention was.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.210" offset="968182">They displayed their identification to him and said, “We're conducting a narcotics investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.757" offset="994408">We're Sheriff's Narcotics officers and we're conducting a narcotics investigation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="231.326" offset="1028681">Well, anyone who practices criminal law in the Los Angeles County, I'm sure knows what a narcotics investigation was, and I'll get into this a little bit later because I think one of the arresting officers indicated to us by his testimony what he considered an investigation was.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.486" offset="1125334">Right at that time, the petitioner, Diane Ker, the wife, walked from the kitchen and he had displayed his identification to her and said the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.671" offset="1170056">Then, he walked over to the kitchen.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.153" offset="1176012">Now, we don't know how far he walked.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.702" offset="1186147">We do know from his testimony -- from the officer's testimony that it was a large living room.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.628" offset="1209866">He walked over to the kitchen and, standing in the doorway, he was able to observe a bricklike brown package sitting on some small scales.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.761" offset="1258454">Observing this, he called both of the petitioners into the kitchen together with the other arresting officer, and -- who had come into the apartment at the same time, and he questioned them about it and he asked him if it was theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.236" offset="1324283">He asked him first what it was and they answered they didn't know, then he said, “Well, it appears to me to be marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.401" offset="1356988">Is it yours?”</text>
            <text syncTime="314.458" offset="1361168">There was no answer from either one of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.348" offset="1376737">Now, the question that was next asked of him at one point -- this testimony incidentally was gone over several times because of the procedure under a section of the California Code that allows this question to be raised out of the presence of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.225" offset="1456253">The question was asked at one time, “And what did you then do?”</text>
            <text syncTime="342.843" offset="1474748">And the answer was, “I then placed the defendants under arrest for suspicion of violation of the State Narcotics Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="352.049" offset="1511528">At another place, the question was asked, “In seeing that marijuana, did you place them under arrest?”</text>
            <text syncTime="359.600" offset="1541726">And the answer was, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="364.710" offset="1562206">A subsequent search was then conducted of other parts of the home and other marijuana was found.The next day, the officers -- one of the officers went to a car which was owned by one of the petitioners and made a search of that and found some additional marijuana.</text>

            <text syncTime="405.127" offset="1723852">The testimony was that the brick package of marijuana had a small rip in it and the inference, apparently, is that the officer was able to see the green leafy substance because he said that it -- he identified it as green leafy substance and he said that he'd seen it before and it appeared to be marijuana.</text>

            <text syncTime="465.921" offset="1967104">They didn't know that there was any narcotics in there and they didn't have a reasonable suspicion sufficient, I believe, for obtaining a search warrant to search the home on the grounds that there -- that narcotics would be found within the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.781" offset="2042546">In fact, one of the officers stated that they had no direct information that the apartment contained any narcotics.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.793" offset="2378585">Our case is that the purpose of the entry into this apartment was an entry for the purpose of searching, although the officers phrased it in terms of conducting a narcotic investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.857" offset="2442846">They let us know what an investigation meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.619" offset="2453817">In fact, on page 111 of the record, there's this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.286" offset="2480567">Did you tell Diane Ker, “Now, look at this”, while you were uncovering something or, “I want you to watch this?”</text>
            <text syncTime="600.560" offset="2505644">Answer: “I made the statements to both defendants throughout the investigation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="605.335" offset="2524662">Question: “What did you tell them?”</text>
            <text syncTime="607.150" offset="2531976">“My exact words, I do not recall.”</text>
            <text syncTime="609.607" offset="2541798">“Generally, what do you say?”</text>
            <text syncTime="612.187" offset="2552142">Answer: “Watch us while we're looking at this particular spot and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.528" offset="2569488">We called their attention to it and if they don't look in our direction when we are checking an article, we reiterate the statement and do not continue the searching until they are watching what we are doing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="626.055" offset="2607626">Searching in an investigation is synonymous with police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.529" offset="2633540">What other type of an investigation would they be conducting?</text>
            <text syncTime="636.196" offset="2648168">This is the most common thing that a lawyer practicing criminal law in the Los Angeles area finds.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.857" offset="2670843">Officers will come up to a person and generally a person who is a known narcotic user, who -- or who they've just seen talking to a known narcotic user and say, “We're conducting a narcotic investigation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="658.427" offset="2737089">The next step that usually happens is that they attempt to obtain the person's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.306" offset="2760600">And -- well, that's not involved here because the officer at the same time walked over to the kitchen and saw the contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.767" offset="2794454">It's significant in determining what the officer's state of mind was and what they intended to do when they went into the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.833" offset="2822666">Also, their language to the landlord, they didn't say, “We're going in to arrest somebody”, or “You have a man there who we suspect of having bought some marijuana, who has some marijuana.”</text>
            <text syncTime="690.736" offset="2866343">They said, “We believe that there's marijuana in the apartment and we're going in.”</text>

            <text syncTime="834.374" offset="3440828">I don't feel that that is constitutionally the significant factor, although I think it is has evidentiary value and I think that inferences can be drawn from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.276" offset="3500492">Of course, at the far ends of the spectrum, we have on one case where a police officer may make an arrest two or three hours after the search and it's hardly -- that's certainly some evidence that the search was not incident to the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.703" offset="3578232">On the other hand, we may have evidence that even though the arrest and the search took place practically at the same time, that the purpose of the arrest was only a pretext for the search, or else that the real purpose, especially where a dwelling is concerned, of going into it was to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.779" offset="3670497">And what we're really concerned with is whether what was in the minds of the police officers at the time they went in.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.950" offset="3699127">This case is similar I think, to the case of United States versus Johnson where the officers smell some opium, what they thought was opium, burning inside of the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.583" offset="3749700">And when they op -- when the door was opened for them, they said, “Consider yourself under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.546" offset="3785540">We're going to search.”</text>
            <text syncTime="922.228" offset="3792332">This Court held that the real purpose of going into the apartment was to search and that the arrest was only a pretext for the search, and I think we have a similar situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.628" offset="3841860">Now, with respect to the events that happened before the entry into the apartment, the -- this man, Murphy, apparently had been known to the officers for some time, at least to one of the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.584" offset="3937677">And Officer Berman, who was one of the arresting officers, had received information over a period of time from anonymous sources or from sources that he did not disclose, claimed a privilege from disclosing them, concerning Murphy in which Ker's name had come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.338" offset="4008730">And the information was that Ker, the petitioner, was dealing in marijuana and he had probably got the marijuana from Murphy.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.172" offset="4060035">Another officer had made a buy from Murphy the day before the -- these events in this case took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.967" offset="4111235">The following day, the day that these events took place, these officers were tailing Murphy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.676" offset="4146030">They were following him and they lost track of him, so they went up to the -- to a sparsely populated place in Los Angeles on Fairfax Avenue near Slauson and about the same place that they had been the night before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.318" offset="4220635">They went up to the top of the hill there so that they could see for some distance in both directions and they noticed, when they went up there, the car that the petitioner was sitting in, it wasn't in the same side of the street as the -- that the officer had purchased the marijuana the night before was sitting out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.094" offset="4299734">It was on the south side of the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.840" offset="4310706">They weren't particularly interested in Ker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.734" offset="4318333">They did note, though, that he was sitting there and that there weren't any other cars with -- there were other cars, but none within 100ft, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.196" offset="4352188">So, they eventually saw Murphy drive by and when he drove by, they attempted to tail him again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.743" offset="4382386">He turned up into the oil fields where he had gone the preceding day, turned his lights off, and they lost track of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.783" offset="4406523">They went back and parked again and 12 minutes later, approximately, they saw him coming out from the oil fields and he parked behind the petitioner's automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.924" offset="4463052">They saw him get out of the automobile and walked up to the side of Ker's car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.515" offset="4481442">Now, there's -- of course, there's some conflict even before this Court, on that issue of how far away they were and what they were able to see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.693" offset="4526164">They were watching through a good pair of binoculars.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.418" offset="4557093">They were probably within 500 to 1000 feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.441" offset="4569109">That seems to be the predominating testimony, although one officer said it was farther.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.850" offset="4590738">And, I think we can infer from the evidence that they were very interested in Murphy and in what he was going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.610" offset="4641834">In the -- at the very beginning of the trial, one of the arresting officers said that it was either light or it was extremely well-lit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.586" offset="4673703">He could see very well and, as soon as the -- they were able incidentally to identify Ker in Court from their observations at a distance, a brick of marijuana is, according to the evidence, is about the size of a brick and shape of a brick.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.097" offset="4767744">And as soon as they saw Murphy drive by, they immediately followed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.116" offset="4787806">They immediately pulled up and drove past, and when they drove past, they saw Mr. Ker sitting in the automobile and he was half-facing Murphy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.636" offset="4825945">He was standing on the street talking with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.434" offset="4837125">And they pulled up towards Slauson, about the same distance away as they had been before, and continued to observe them all this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.875" offset="4874846">The period of time that elapsed during this observation was approximately two minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.021" offset="4899506">Now, a question was asked a number of times, “Did you see anything passed or did you see anything in his hand?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.708" offset="4930226">And the answer was, “No, I didn't.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.994" offset="4943391">It's true and it was pointed out by respondent at one point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.264" offset="4960423">The question was asked, “Could you see anything in his hand?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.937" offset="4975156">And the answer was, “I didn't see anything in his hand.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.326" offset="4984665">And then, after it was repeated, “Well, could you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.978" offset="4999293">And the answer was, “Well, I don't believe I would be able to see anything in his hand if he had it”, paraphrasing it, the question, “Why not?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.550" offset="5045582">And the answer, “Well, because of the distance and the fact that it wasn't extremely light.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.569" offset="5073690">The fact remains that nothing was seen to pass at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.012" offset="5091453">Now, I think the subsequent conduct of the officers after that event took place can illustrate to us that the -- that they didn't believe that he had any contraband in his possession at that time or if he did have any contraband, if they thought he did, they weren't interested at that time in arresting him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.259" offset="5172433">They had pull past where the -- where Mr. Murphy was talking with Ker and parked in a parking lot about the same distance away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.593" offset="5201795">This was towards Slauson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.732" offset="5210258">Now, as soon as the conversation ended, they appeared to be talking, the two of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.521" offset="5237426">Ker drove away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.933" offset="5243068">He drove towards Slauson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.205" offset="5248188">He went right past where the officers were, and their testimony was that they followed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.113" offset="5271803">There was nothing said that they were pursuing him or attempting to catch him and in fact, they followed him quite a distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.776" offset="5298448">He turned left on Slauson and went all the way down to La Brea which is a considerable distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.032" offset="5327496">He turned left on La Brea and after going approximately a block, he made a U-turn and came back on La Brea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.612" offset="5361768">They said that they lost him at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.986" offset="5375352">Now, I'm sure that if these officers were interested at that time in arresting this man, that was their purpose, it would've been an easy matter to arrest him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.183" offset="5424149">He drove right past them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.242" offset="5432299">In fact, the officer -- one of the officers states in another context what he meant by “following.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.749" offset="5462392">The night before, they were following Murphy and they lost him because he had made a turn also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.233" offset="5496351">So, the question was asked, “Well, were you pursuing him?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.005" offset="5511398">And he said, “No, we were following him”, to that effect, for the purpose of tailing him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.091" offset="5535744">And, I'm sure that that's what they were doing with Ker also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.470" offset="5549223">Now, these officers, at that time, had never seen Ker before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.834" offset="5566673">They didn't know anything about him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.130" offset="5575868">All they know is that he had talked with the man that had made a sale of marijuana and that they knew something about.</text>

            <text syncTime="1824.849" offset="7402768">The -- I think that -- I think one of the crucial things here, and I said this before, is the purpose of the officers in going into the home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.953" offset="7463163">I think it can be -- to dispose of this problem, I think that it can be -- I think it's obvious from all of the evidence that the purpose that they had when they went into the door was to see if there was anything there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.663" offset="7534007">We found, for the first time before this Court, that an additional item of testimony that of the defendant below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.989" offset="7571310">The petitioner here was introduced in the respondent's brief, and that is that George Ker said that when the officers came in, they immediately handcuffed him and placed him under arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.282" offset="7624495">One of them went into the kitchen and the other one went into the bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.704" offset="7650200">This, of course, is a variance with the statements of all of the officers and I think that when we have evidence like that from a person whose home has been invaded that we have to take that in a larger sense, he wasn't a professional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.510" offset="7721462">He didn't know what was going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.818" offset="7730657">And the larger sense was that he recalled the rather traumatic experience of someone coming and walking right into his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.355" offset="7768795">He recalled being handcuffed and taken into the kitchen and that what he purported to give was a summary of the transaction, that he wasn't aware of the problems that we have here in the sequence of events and their importance upon a determination of whether the entry was to search or to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.856" offset="7846745">Now, to answer Mr. Justice White's question now, I think would be appropriate, and that is that there is a distinction between an entry into a home to arrest and one to search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.974" offset="7911320">And I think that that distinction has become apparent since the case of Mapp versus Ohio in state court proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.918" offset="7947055">In one instance, we have a direct constitutional question involved under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.672" offset="7982059">In the other, we have a constitutional question ins -- in what I consider to be a collateral sense because a search incident lawful arrest would depend, first, upon the validity of the arrest which is something that is not a constitutional question in the broad sense and secondly, upon the reasonableness of the search afterwards that -- and whether it's really incident to the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.778" offset="8086444">I think in both of these cases that the testimony here demonstrates that the search was unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.108" offset="8123852">First, that it cannot be sustained as a search incident to an arrest because the primary purpose was to search.</text>

            <text syncTime="2044.709" offset="8282258">And insofar as the invasion of a person's home is concerned, that the minimum right that a citizen is entitled to coincides with this Court's decision in federal cases involving the entry into a home.</text>

            <text syncTime="2067.940" offset="8375150">I feel that the entry into a person's home is something different from other types of searches and other types of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.745" offset="8414333">And, I feel that the minimum protection a person should have before an entry is made into his home is that the facts possessed by the police should be presented to a neutral magistrate for a determination of whether or not probable cause exists because I think it's been demonstrated and I feel that this Court has demonstrated in its decisions that police officers in a zealous pursuit of law enforcement sometimes ignore the rights of individuals and that their actions are unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.240" offset="8572322">And that -- when we present this to a magistrate afterwards, after the damage has been done, and after the -- with the benefit of hindsight and undoubtedly, some weight being given to the fact that narcotics or other contraband was actually found, that there's no real protection at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="2705.717" offset="10926268">Well, I think California, as any other state should be left free to make up its own rules only if they do not violate the minimum standards of constitutional guarantees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2741.850" offset="11070777">Of course, they can provide higher standards, make it more difficult for police officers to break into a person's home and I feel that the course of history has been whenever we make it more difficult for police officers to accomplish a given end and with the object of protecting a person's rights, that it doesn't -- as contended by the respondent, it doesn't impair the administration of justice or police efficiency.</text>

            <text syncTime="3520.842" offset="14186768">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.324" offset="14216652">Before proceeding any further with the argument for respondent in this case, I would wish, if I may, to delimit the issues perhaps a more restrictive manner than Mr. Stanley has delimited them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.843" offset="14266702">But I do not believe that this Court has faced under Footnote 9 of the Mapp decision with any problem as to the reasonableness of the search of the bedroom in which a half-ounce of marijuana was obtained, the search of the kitchen cupboard which succeeded the arrest, and the subsequent search the following day of the car belonging to the petitioner, Diane Ker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.219" offset="14364296">It has been the law of California since the inception of the Cahan decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.395" offset="14384985">The citation on that is the Kitchen's case in 46 Cal.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.571" offset="14405674">All the cases incidentally which I will mention in argument are compendiously contained in our summary of the California cases at the close of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.450" offset="14445171">But to repeat, it has been the law of California since the Cahan decision that unless an objection is made at the trial to the introduction of evidence whose providence is contended to be illegal, such a point may not be asserted upon the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.519" offset="14517478">Turning to the record in this case, we concede for the purpose -- at least for the purpose of review by certiorari that objections were properly made for the purpose at least to preserving the point here as to the kilo-brick of marijuana in the kitchen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.645" offset="14597935">That case -- that was litigated at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.571" offset="14617684">As to the question of the search of the bedroom, the search of the kitchen cupboard, and the car, it was specifically stated by Mr. (Inaudible) at the trial, page 68 of the record, there was no objection to the introduction in evidence of these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.144" offset="14687901">There was no litigation as to the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the search which produced these items and that question isn't properly here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3689.885" offset="14862921">But the point is, assuming that I will assume arguendo the correctness of my position up to this point, namely that the officers had probable cause for an arrest, namely that the entry of the apartment was legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.547" offset="14917569">If my position is sound on these points, the only conceivable objection which they could have to the introduction of this other contraband is that it was produced by a skirt -- by a search party which in scope, extent, an area was not justified by the fact that it was incident to an arrest based upon probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.202" offset="15004191">That raises other issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.903" offset="15010983">That's a question of scope under Harris, Rabinowitz, and the other cases which apply that rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="4477.172" offset="18012035">I wish to mention first that it is not California's contention that California law in this case should be constain -- should be sustained merely because it is ours and because we love it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4488.751" offset="18058428">Our contention is that, subsequent to the Mapp decision, California standards should be sustained by this Court if those standards are reasonable within the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.741" offset="18110360">We certainly do not demand absolute carte blanche for absolute everything that conceivably come into the minds of the California legislature of the California Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4512.059" offset="18151633">It is our position that the arrest in this case of petitioner, George Ker, was a valid arrest based upon probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4520.209" offset="18184234">The standards in this case of probable cause being the same under California law as they are under federal law that the search of the apartment was based upon reason -- excuse me, that the search of the apartment was a reasonable search as an incident to the arrest and also, if I may add, the methods by which the officers gain entry into the apartment were not illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4544.641" offset="18281932">Now, turning to the facts, I think that Mr. Stanley in his argument for petitioner has unnecessarily restricted the meaning of the information which the officers possessed at the time they entered the apartment for the purpose of making the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4565.034" offset="18363538">We can speculate what they might have done under other facts, under other circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4572.375" offset="18392900">The question is raised if the officers believed at the time they saw Ker and Murphy at this meet, a meet incidentally in the same spot where Cook and Terrhagen had actually consummated a transaction of narcotics the night before, the only distinction being that Cook and Terrhagen were on the east side of the street facing north and Ker and Murphy were on the west side of the Fairfax Street facing south.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.998" offset="18511391">Why didn't they arrest him at this time?</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.924" offset="18523094">The officers -- Officer Warthen didn't know Ker, didn't know him personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.229" offset="18540335">Of course he got a look at him and he was able to identify him for the purposes of trial as a man whom he saw, but he didn't know George Ker.</text>
            <text syncTime="4617.000" offset="18571368">The one who knew George Ker, who had seen his picture, and who received information that Ker was a purchaser of narcotics from Murphy was Officer Berman who didn't come into the picture with respect to this arrest until later.</text>
            <text syncTime="4633.625" offset="18637824">In other words, the facts in this case are a block.</text>
            <text syncTime="4637.706" offset="18654229">Having failed to follow -- to track Ker to his lair due to this illusive U-turn which he took losing the officers, the officers attempted to find out who he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.587" offset="18701772">They checked with the Department of Motor Vehicles and they learned that this automobile which they have witnessed Murphy approach and where Murphy and Ker have a conversation is an automobile registered to Ker and registered at a given address, 4801 Slauson, which is on Slauson and extremely near the intersection of Fairfax and Slauson, near where, the night before, there had actually been consummated a narcotics transaction and where, the same night, not half-an-hour previously, the officers had seen Ker and Murphy meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4688.188" offset="18856103">And prior to that, had seen and tracked Murphy to his lair in the oil fields where he arguably, the officers had reason to believe, kept his stash because that's where he went the night before when he transacted the narcotics sale with Cook and Terrhagen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4707.989" offset="18935306">Realizing now who the car was registered to, having transmitted that information to Officer Berman within 15 to 30 minutes following this meeting between Ker and Murphy, the officers tell Berman, “We've checked the car out.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4724.729" offset="19002284">The officers tell Berman what they had seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4728.471" offset="19017226">Berman tells him -- tells them what he knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="4733.107" offset="19035826">Therefore, this -- what to the layman might appear to be an ambiguous meeting between a narcotics seller and another man but comes in the light of the officers' experience, these were experienced officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4748.047" offset="19095594">They are not neophytes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.667" offset="19102072">Berman had 3 years experience and had participated in 300 arrests, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4754.881" offset="19122866">Warthen, I believe, 4 years as a narcotics officer, had participated in what he called quite a few hundred arrests.</text>
            <text syncTime="4761.991" offset="19151287">These are experienced officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.438" offset="19161109">These facts previously known to them, this information, we submit, reasonably justified them as prudent and cautious men, there's no doubt that they were, at that time, in a belief that there had been an actual consummated narcotic transaction between Ker and Murphy at that night.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.696" offset="19238118">And bear in mind, the information which the -- all the officers possessed at the time they entered that apartment, at the time rather that they approached the apartment was not the information which Warthen alone and Markman alone had at the time of seeing the meet, they superimposed upon that the information from Berman.</text>
            <text syncTime="4805.483" offset="19325262">We submit that, under California law, as well as under federal law, the officers were certainly warranted in entertaining a belief that Ker had committed that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4818.029" offset="19375522">Now, turning to the entry of the apartment, Mr. Stanley has made the point in oral argument that Section 844 which is the California entry for purpose of arrest statute has been made a dead letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.933" offset="19427140">I believe this is an exaggeration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4834.155" offset="19439992">Maddox in 46 Cal.2d is the leading case on this subject, as I believe it was Justice Brennan who mentioned during Mr. Stanley's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4843.457" offset="19477191">There, of course, had been cases subsequent to Maddox.</text>

            <text syncTime="5479.987" offset="22023293">The officers certainly, on the basis of their past experience and the reported cases sustained them, in the 100 instances, where they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="5489.381" offset="22060910">At least knock on the door and this takes place in the belief that Ker, knowing Ker to be whom they had reason to believe, would've attempted to dispose and perhaps could've succeeded in disposing that marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="5502.900" offset="22114931">Now, having entered the apartment, if the Court please, the question arises whether the kilo-brick of marijuana which was discovered, sir, in plain sight in the kitchen without the entry of a closed door into the kitchen from the living room, was the product of a search incident to a lawful arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="5569.838" offset="22382738">This reasoning I believe is sound reasoning and I respectfully commended to the Court as being reasoning which, in support of the result which is fully consistent with standards of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, in Justice Treanor's reasoning, if I may paraphrase him, is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="5591.293" offset="22468524">The officers, as I argue here and I'll apply the reasoning to the facts of this particular case to make it more compelling, if I'm able to make it compelling, the officers have probable cause to arrest Ker for possession of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="5608.559" offset="22537592">Under the federal cases and I take it, that Rabinowitz obtains as it is under the law of California, the officers have the right, as an incident to that arrest based upon probable cause to conduct a search not unreasonable in extent of the person and property of the offenders, the Kers, for the purpose of -- certainly at the very least, of discovering the contraband for whose possession they were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="5639.686" offset="22662144">There is, therefore, a right, if you will, to invade the privacy of the defendants, the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="5645.951" offset="22687222">I can think of very few invasions of the right to privacy more catastrophic than an arrest and it is our position here that the arrest was valid as based on probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5657.088" offset="22731734">If there is probable cause to make the arrest, it is certainly no more a violation of the right to privacy or the constitutional rights of the accused for the search to precede rather than to follow the arrest, so long as independently of what has turned up in the search, the officers have probable cause for making the arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="5853.769" offset="23518438">But certainly, let me say this as a minimum, that it is at least California's understanding of the Rabinowitz decision that it goes farther than Your Honor says it explicitly goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5864.456" offset="23561174">Let me phrase it that way in a non-contentious manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5867.929" offset="23575071">Now, let us assume that Trupiano were to be restored and Rabinowitz were to be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="5880.283" offset="23624495">Waiving the question whether this would be a desirable result, I'm not arguing that from the federal courts because I do not think this could profitably argued as a question federal law at least without the appearance of Mr. Solicitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5894.125" offset="23679875">The question would arise whether, first, if Trupiano were restored, states would under the Due Process Clause be bound to follow it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5902.729" offset="23714252">And second, where even under the facts here, sir, were Trupiano the law, whether this would be a Trupiano case, I submit it would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5913.644" offset="23757928">Because the exception in Trupiano was that a warrant, even where a warrant might be required, is required only where the obtainment of a warrant would be practical.</text>
            <text syncTime="5925.263" offset="23804426">Now, if I may say this, it would not have been absolutely physically impossible if the officers have delayed entry into this apartment for the purpose of obtaining the warrant, it would've been not absolutely physically impossible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5945.983" offset="23887287">But, the officers had tracked this man to the lair.</text>
            <text syncTime="5949.700" offset="23902124">They knew he was selling from his apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5953.194" offset="23916126">This was at the night time, 9 o clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="5957.676" offset="23934098">Be it 9:30, would've taken the officers quite some time to find a Deputy District Attorney who could write an affidavit for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5965.962" offset="23967222">Police officers don't, unless they are vastly experienced in such matters, write affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5971.632" offset="23989896">And the affidavit would have to be, not merely complex as the facts here are complex but sufficient to obtain not merely the approval of the magistrate but good enough to survive post-arrest attack upon the sufficiency of the affidavit to constitute probable cause for a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5993.210" offset="24076204">Not only is that true, they then have to find a magistrate and Mr. Stanley has referred liberally to experience in the California Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6001.533" offset="24109537">It's just hard to find a Deputy District Attorney at that hour, harder to find a magistrate in cases other than this where the man is tracked to his lair in a completely unbuilt up area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6012.663" offset="24154049">You know how large Los Angeles County is.</text>
            <text syncTime="6014.895" offset="24162931">We're 50 miles by 50 miles in both directions.</text>

            <text syncTime="6023.743" offset="24198353">It might be said, of course, that the officer could've left the man at the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="6028.383" offset="24216952">But I think, and this has been mentioned in the Johnson case, the opium smoking case, they could've guarded the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="6034.813" offset="24242657">It's been mentioned in Jeffers, in 342 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.305" offset="24256554">They could've guarded the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="6040.803" offset="24266585">But what would have happened in this case if they've left someone to guard the door while the remaining officers went out to get a warrant?</text>
            <text syncTime="6048.946" offset="24299186">Ker, as they knew, supplied out of his apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6053.109" offset="24315800">Suppose one of his clients walked up to the apartment, what could that officer do?</text>
            <text syncTime="6059.051" offset="24339623">If he attempted to block that man's entrance, the man would go away and telephone Ker and within a few minutes, the officer would reasonably hear the sound of the disposal, the narcotics being disposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="6072.677" offset="24394062">And there would go the evidence the officers were out attempting to obtain a warrant for the purpose of security.</text>
            <text syncTime="6078.732" offset="24418304">Now, in summary of our position, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6088.343" offset="24456756">It is California's view which we earnestly and sincerely maintain, that, notwithstanding the argument presented by Mr. Stanley, the question remains under Mapp versus Ohio, one of due process, that under the Due Process Clause, that California's standards are reasonable and the finding based upon those standards are reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6115.350" offset="24564799">They should be upheld by this Court and should not be cast out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6120.331" offset="24584652">It is likewise our position that as applied to the facts of this particular case, the officers, under the standards imposed under the federal courts as well as under the California Courts, have probable cause for the arrest of petitioner, George Ker.</text>
            <text syncTime="6136.131" offset="24647868">As to Mrs. Ker, I rest upon what I said in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6141.445" offset="24669184">Respecting the entry, it is California's position that it was lawful under the exception to the statutes engrafted by judicial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6150.780" offset="24706487">And on this point, I may make this point, and I think it's a valid one to make, that in Miller versus the United States, in 357 U.S., the Government explicitly refused to raise the question of exigent circumstances where there was an ambiguous attempt to gain entrance at the door.</text>
