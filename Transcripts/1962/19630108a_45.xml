            <label>Mr. Isaac E. Ferguson</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">May it please Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.039" offset="215542">This case is here for the second time on direct appeal from the judgment of a three-judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.080" offset="271653">The previous appeal was from a judgment dismissing appellants’ complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.321" offset="312613">That judgment was reversed by this Court because it was remanded to the District Court to try the case on the merits for other proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.510" offset="393383">The present appeal is from the judgment after trial on the merits, denying the relief prayed in appellants’ complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.260" offset="456391">I remind the Court that the appellants are growers, handlers of avocados produced in South Florida, and that the avocados marketed by appellants are sold without restriction in all states of the union except California, the only other state in which avocados are produced commercially.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.781" offset="610513">I remind the Court further that all of the avocados grown in the Florida production area are marketed in interstate commerce or directly affect interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.401" offset="688985">And that since June 11, 1954, all marketing of the Florida avocados has been governed by a marketing order made by the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.246" offset="804342">The essence of the marketing order is the establishment and enforcement of standards of maturity and quality as the condition precedent to the marketing of the Florida avocados.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.917" offset="875081">The complaint of the appellants is that notwithstanding compliance with the maturity and quality regulations imposed under the federal marketing order, an near embargo against the marketing of the Florida avocados in California is enforced by prohibiting sale of the avocados in that state, unless they contained 8% or more of oil or fat as required by Section 792 of the Agricultural Code of California.</text>

            <label>Mr. Isaac E. Ferguson</label>
            <text syncTime="236.555" offset="1049579">Oh, yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.350" offset="1060760">Yes, indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.959" offset="1063163">It follows the complaint in the first volume and begins -- Page 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.108" offset="1171832">This 8% oil requirement is foreign to the nature of the avocados grown in Florida, also foreign to the maturity and quality regulations under the federal marketing order.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.422" offset="1261066">Such embargo, appellants contend, flaunts the Commerce Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution, at the same time thwarts and undermines the effectiveness of the regulation of the marketing of this fruit under the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.032" offset="1351450">On the previous appeal in this case, it was held by this Court, first, that a three-judge District Court was properly convened to hear the case since the complaint seeks to enjoin enforcement of a state statute in application to the marketing of the avocados handled by appellants on substantial grounds of federal unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.727" offset="1474330">Second, the direct appeal to this Court from the judgment of the District Court was proper notwithstanding the joinder of a claim that enforcement of the state statute in the manner complained of is a violation of an Act of Congress regulating interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.703" offset="1558235">Third, that it was not incumbent upon appellants prior to consideration of their complaint in accord of the United States to apply for the desired relief in an action in the California Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.206" offset="1624168">Fourth, that appellants are entitled to have determined in this federal court action on the merits the rights asserted under the Constitution of the United States, also under the Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 enacted by Congress pursuant to the authority granted by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.080" offset="1743705">It said in the opinion of the District Court that but for the direction of this Court to hear and adjudicase -- adjudicate the case on the merits, the District Court might either have declined to exercise equitable jurisdiction in the case or it might have withheld exercise of jurisdiction to await state court adjudication of the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.443" offset="1865122">I respectfully submit that this statement of the District Court is quite immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.120" offset="1895842">That it is of no moment how the District Court might otherwise have disposed of the case if not constrained by the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.472" offset="1945266">I submit likewise that the reargument by appellees in the form of cross-appeal of issues decided by this Court on the former appeal calls for no consideration on the present appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.948" offset="2031156">On the merits, I submit, the record is devoid of any support for the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.442" offset="2081102">The essential elements of appellants’ case are virtually uncontested.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.741" offset="2110360">The most striking circumstance of this case is that nowhere in the evidence is there the least suggestion of fault in the Florida avocados.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.206" offset="2172217">No suggestion of unhealtfulness, unpalatability, or inferiority of quality in any respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.472" offset="2225298">The challenged California statute says in effect that all avocados with less than 8% of oil are immature, but no witness says that this is true of the avocados grown in Florida which come to market with less than 8% of oil content.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.816" offset="2314637">On the other hand, it is affirmatively established by the extensive and an impugned scientific research that some varieties of Florida avocados attain maturity and are ready to be marketed with oil content as low as 2% or 3%, while other varieties which may ultimately attain 8% oil content, do so only in minor volume and late in the marketing season for these avocados and even then without the requisite consistency for affecting -- effective marketing in face of the 8% oil barrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.343" offset="2528737">The main -- the evidence regarding the marketing of the Florida avocados covers the period since June 11, 1954 when the Federal Florida Avocado order went into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.632" offset="2593938">No question is raised by the appellees as to the validity of the Act of Congress pursuant to which the marketing order was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.417" offset="2629047">However, an abortive attempt was made by the appellees to show that the regulations issued under the marketing order and the methods of administration thereof have failed to comply with the requirements of the Marketing Agreement Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.032" offset="2707519">Oral testimony was taken and a great many exhibits for identification in furtherance of this defense, but upon the trial of the case, the defense was withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.728" offset="2758301">Nevertheless, it is reasserted in the brief by the appellees in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.741" offset="2782333">It set forth in answer in appellants’ reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.949" offset="2811173">The reason for adoption of the Florida Avocado Marketing Agreement was the need to establish and enforce satisfactory standards of maturity and quality for the marketing of this fruit in place of the ineffective self-regulation then prevailing in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.068" offset="2903646">Since 1954 by the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Agriculture from season to season, standards of maturity and quality have been established and have governed all marketing of the avocados produced in the South Florida area.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.728" offset="2986297">No shipment of Florida avocados is permitted without a certificate of compliance with these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.014" offset="3027466">A certificate issued after inspection of the fruit by the Joint Inspection Service of the United States Department of Agriculture and the Florida Department of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.728" offset="3082324">In California alone, on arrival of a shipment of avocados from Florida, the federal certification of the fruit as of requisite maturity and quality is disregarded and instead the 8% oil test is applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.414" offset="3165080">Under the federal regulations, oil or fat content does not enter into determination of the maturity or quality of the Florida avocados.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.582" offset="3229654">By a decade of scientific research, the years 1951 to 1955 by Dr. Roy W. Harkness at a subtropical experiment station of the University of Florida, Homestead, Florida and in years from 194 -- 1954 onward by Dr. Paul L. Harding, and his staff of assistants at the United States Horticultural Field Station at Orlando, Florida, also at the agricultural marketing station of the United States Department of Agriculture at Miami, Florida, it has been irreputably established that oil content is not a scientifically valid determinant of either the maturity or quality of the Florida avocados.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.031" offset="3451486">That there is no consistent relationship between the oil content of the fruit and the maturity or palatability, that some varieties of the Florida avocados attain maturity and maximal quality with a little as 2%, 3% or 4% of oil, that of the other varieties, although some may ultimately attain as much or more than 8% of oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.114" offset="3591816">This occurs only late in the marketing season for these varieties that only inconsistently and well past the time when they have attained maturity and are ready to be marketed.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.326" offset="3652629">It has also been determined by checkup on the marketing of the Florida avocados from year to year since 1954, that maturity and palatability of these avocados is assured by prescribing permissible shipping dates for each variety of the fruit in each season in correlation with attainment by the fruit of specified minimum weight or diameter.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.044" offset="3787525">Accordingly, under the federal marketing order, the Secretary of Agriculture has in each season since 1954 issued maturity regulations establishing permissible picking dates for each of some 40 varieties of the Florida avocados, dates when avocados of the designated variety may be picked and shipped if then of the specified minimum weight or diameter.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.736" offset="3934333">Both Dr. Harkness and Dr. Harding were examined as witnesses in this case, and the record on appeal exhibits the nature sent, the results of their studies of the maturation and palatability of the Florida avocados.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.780" offset="4378520">There could be no finding in this case regarding the validity of this standard of 8% oil content in relation to the Florida avocados of the numerous varieties that is not consonant with the testimony of Dr. Harkness and Dr. Harding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.034" offset="4491473">There is no other testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.746" offset="4522402">There is shown in several ways in the record of this case the inapplicability of the oil standard to this as proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.565" offset="4609651">Many thousands of oil tests were made in the research project conducted by Dr. Harkness and then in subsequent years by the staff of the Department of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.870" offset="4682898">They established, first, affirmatively that these avocados do come to maturity with less than 8% oil content, in fact many of them with less than a half of that oil content.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.152" offset="4751966">That the other varieties, if they ever attain 8% oil content, do so only five, six, seven, or eight weeks after they are mature in accordance with the standards established under the federal regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.334" offset="4828662">Your Honor, I'm answering your question at this time in a sense out of order because the argument to which I am now directing myself is the fact that standards have been established under federal law, that these are the standards prescribing the condition for the marketing of this fruit in all 50 states of the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="3325.573" offset="13405706">If the Court please before proceeding to the problems of federalism which are involved in this case, it's necessary that we make comment on the state of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.378" offset="13460877">As by way of example, counsel referred that to the evidence that the California statute was ultimate -- practically a total embargo on the shipments Florida avocados to California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.623" offset="13513853">There is no such evidence, no such proof in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.478" offset="13533288">What happened at the trial was that handlers produced but one witness, a Mr. Harding who was in-charge of the federal research program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.676" offset="13582085">Their main proof was in the form of depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.892" offset="13594937">These depositions and exhibits take 297 pages of federal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.689" offset="13618134">These depositions were taken pursuant to a writ of stipulation which is part of the original record on file that all objections, except the form of the question are to be reserved until the time of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.829" offset="13670693">And that the parties then may enter their exceptions to the depositions as if the witnesses were personally on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.554" offset="13709563">Now, these depositions were taken before a notary public who does not have authority to hear objections, therefore counsel as a matter of practice, the taking of depositions allows wide latitude for questioning in order to allow -- for discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.272" offset="13768495">State officers then at the trial were entitled then upon objection to have them read at length at the trial, handlers at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.654" offset="13809977">Now, the handlers are the handlers that Mr. Justice Goldberg referred to are the two Florida appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.779" offset="13838503">I refer to the parties as the handlers who are the appellants and state officers who are appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.496" offset="13865357">Well, handlers at the trial did not offer to read the depositions and exhibits into the record as is normally done instead they offered them in mass, and state officers promptly objected and asked that they be read at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.909" offset="13923035">The District Court reserved ruling on the admissibility of these depositions and in a post trial written order after the parties had filed briefs in which both sides discussed the evidentiary objections to the depositions, the District Court expressly excluded the depositions from evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3491.598" offset="14069739">Well, the point here is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.701" offset="14094190">We think that first, if handlers wish to contest of this exclusion of depositions that they should have posted in one of the questions presented in their jurisdictional statement which they have not done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.382" offset="14148942">And secondly, that in this mass of 297 pages, we are confident that much of it is inadmissible and that it is not incumbent upon the District Court or in this Court to go through each page and separate the admissible from the inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.988" offset="14203277">Therefore, it was reasonable for the District Court to exclude all the depositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.082" offset="14231698">Now handlers, both in the trial court and in this Court, assert that the depositions and exhibits were in evidence at the time of the trial because state officers in our previous motions to dismiss had made reference to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.675" offset="14310066">Now, in a motion to dismiss in the trial court it's proper for the District Court to look at the depositions to ascertain its jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.443" offset="14341099">This Court so held in Land versus Dollar, but the party filing a motion, such a motion to dismiss, does not waive their objections to the introduction of the depositions and evidence at a later time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.053" offset="14399613">They are making a concession provisionally for the purposes of the motion only and this is the ruling in the Sixth and Seventh Circuits on motions for summary judgment and motion for -- motions for judgment in the pleading.</text>

            <text syncTime="4860.844" offset="19546781">The avocados are grown commercially in California and Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.289" offset="19580531">Now, avocados are picked for commercial marketing in a hard inedible state and it cannot be told from looking an avocado whether it's mature enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="4898.408" offset="19697037">Now, the problem arises in the avocado industry because the nature sets the end of the shipping season for the avocado grower.</text>
            <text syncTime="4907.549" offset="19733608">The fruit becomes overripe right on the tree and drops, so the only control the grower has is at the beginning of the season.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.582" offset="19761716">Now, the beginning of the season, the price is high and so there's a temptation for growers to ship their avocados early even though the avocados may be immature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4923.873" offset="19798915">Now, for this reason, California, very early, sought a way of protecting the California consumer from the deceptive marketing of avocados which were immature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4935.226" offset="19844263">And it was observed that as the avocado matures the oil content increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4941.355" offset="19868818">And it is a practical matter in avocados that had 8% oil content would mature into a soft edible fruit and avocado that had less than 8% oil content would not so mature.</text>

            <text syncTime="6767.773" offset="27174431">That's right and here it is absolutely complete because it is the only standard applicable to these avocados.</text>
            <text syncTime="6779.545" offset="27221556">Just a moment about the evidence in this peculiar after trial statement that they were not admitted, repeatedly Your Honors will see that these depositions were admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6793.121" offset="27275891">They were offered and admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6795.515" offset="27285400">And then as Mr. Fourt says, he wanted to -- have them read, I never objected to having them read but the judges didn't want to sit and hear them read.</text>
            <text syncTime="6809.104" offset="27339839">And the -- he said, “We object Your Honor and we respectfully ask permission and request that they'd be read in order that we may make objections to the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="6821.639" offset="27389889">We have a written memorandum prepared outlining objections to each proposed item.</text>
            <text syncTime="6826.475" offset="27409324">We have objections to many of the answers as being hearsay.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6831.256" offset="27428446">Then Judge Goodman said, “We will mark the depositions in the evidence and we will reserve ruling on the objections that had been filed when we have had a chance to examine them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6846.417" offset="27489050">And Mr. Fourt protested like this, “Thank you very much.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6851.207" offset="27508172">Then at a later time, at the end of the case, when the Court told us what they wanted in the way of a transcript, Judge Albert said, “You don't have to reproduce what's in this record that was before this Court for all these depositions were here before” and it was not my argument that they couldn't make objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="6876.560" offset="27609631">They made all of the objections they wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6878.214" offset="27616214">As far as I was concerned, there was no ruling on the objections, no place.</text>
            <text syncTime="6882.763" offset="27634395">There is no ruling on the objections and the elementary rule is that if an objection is made and not ruled upon, then it is nothing, the record stands and it's admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="6894.636" offset="27681938">This is repeated several times that these depositions and the exhibits are admitted subject to objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="6901.656" offset="27710046">This after trial statement is not a ruling on objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="6907.788" offset="27734497">A typical objection is that the depositions were taken pursuant to depositions -- to stipulation were not admissible because the witnesses -- it wasn't shown that they resided more than a hundred miles away from Sacramento.</text>
            <text syncTime="6921.818" offset="27790608">The depositions were taken in Miami.</text>
            <text syncTime="6923.837" offset="27798758">Is there any ruling on that objection?</text>
            <text syncTime="6925.709" offset="27806177">Is there any ruling that any particular thing is hearsay?</text>
            <text syncTime="6928.988" offset="27819342">Your Honors will look in vain, any place in this record for rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6932.357" offset="27832822">That is why we had no occasion in our brief in this case to say anything about it and it has been pointed out here the Court considered them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6940.844" offset="27866781">The -- and the -- one statement is that they considered them arguendo. One statement is -- it considered them offers of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="6948.529" offset="27897501">I made no offers of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="6950.759" offset="27906382">I offered them in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6951.915" offset="27911084">They were received in evidence and as was pointed out here, even in this post trial statement, it is said they were considered by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6966.887" offset="27970957">And then the opinion of the Court, it says, they were assumed to be admissible, all assumed to be admissible and considered arguendo whatever the word arguendo may mean then.</text>
            <text syncTime="6980.082" offset="28023724">Now, it is admitted over and over again here in the briefs of the other side that the West Indian varieties which have importance as particularly one of them, the -- all of them has had sizeable production and could have a great deal more.</text>
            <text syncTime="6998.347" offset="28096763">And it would come at a time when it would have a very favorable market in California in September and October when California avocados have practically disappeared from the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="7008.951" offset="28139186">That they never attain 8% oil content, that's admitted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7012.656" offset="28154023">Then they argued the merchantability and when His Honor put the question what is -- what would be the case if they were delivered by airplane, actually, the argument is suspicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="7024.922" offset="28203029">The practicability, it depends on speed of transportation and refrigeration, both of which have advanced greatly from year to year.</text>
            <text syncTime="7035.826" offset="28246706">And it's a merchant's question to answer whether they can be successfully marketed in California not a judicial question and many other things is a grossly distorted statement here about Dr. Harding's testimony about oil content and that some of them have attained 20% during the shipping season and he argued nothing -- he stated nothing of the sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="7061.457" offset="28349210">There are various other things but I see a red light here and I thank Your Honors again.</text>
