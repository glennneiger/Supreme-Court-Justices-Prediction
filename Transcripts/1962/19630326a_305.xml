            <text syncTime="20.891" offset="186911">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.115" offset="207809">This proceeding originated where an income tax deficiency for the years 1952 and 1953, the issues by the time they reached the Tax Court, had narrowed to three.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.335" offset="260681">First, involving a deduction for a payment made by the petitioner to one DM Dossier which was decided favorably for the taxpayer, the Government has not appealed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.862" offset="314807">The second involved some statutory penalties in which partially decided in favor of the petitioner and partially for the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.313" offset="348662">Neither side has appealed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.819" offset="362663">The issue before this Court coming by certiorari from the Fifth Circuit has split decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.341" offset="384711">Judge Hutcheson dissenting and the sole issue in this case is whether the $56,975.10 bad debt owed by Mission Orange Bottling Company Inc. to petitioner was a business bad debt or a non-business bad debt within Section 23 (k) (1) and 23 (k) (4) of the Internal Revenue Act of 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.778" offset="510516">It was stipulated in the Tax Court by the Commissioner, one, that this was a debt; and two, that it became worthless in 1953, the tax here in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.854" offset="558791">The only and the real issue in this case as responded admits in his brief is whether the extensive, varied, regular and continuous activities of the petitioner over a long period of years were business activities or were investment activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.828" offset="650637">Some idea of how extensive these activities were or how varied they were can be gathered from a quick glance at the many items on his 1952 income tax on page 20 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.573" offset="709674">How extensive they were can be determined from how many -- from the substantial sums amounting to over $150,000 in ordinary income which these activities generated in the years 1952 out of which the bad debt in question arose in the form of $62,800 in salaries from six corporations in the form of $27,500 in rent from three separate building, in the form of over $4,000 in interest from 17 different parties and $56,000 from partnership income.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.146" offset="892008">These came from enterprises of which the petitioner was the architect.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.960" offset="919176">He created these himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.897" offset="934954">These came from business not investment activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.227" offset="956270">1941 to 1953, the petitioner organized some 22 corporations, 10 partnerships and a number of joint ventures.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.570" offset="993677">Some idea of the way the petitioner operated can be seen from the account of high form and promoted the tile distributorship with a man named Lisby on page 88 and 89 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.668" offset="1062013">He also entered into the restaurant business.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.892" offset="1074970">He promoted oil deals in West Texas and in Lee -- in Lee County and Washington County.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.036" offset="1107466">He went out and suddenly bought some property from Fairway Department Stores when they were under the gun to out of five-day deadline to begin construction for which he was paid a fee and paid ordinary income on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1003.110" offset="4115832">And its credit was right and yet it didn't rely idle gave him a full time, kept him busy as a full time business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.196" offset="4156165">The second is that you must create ordinary income through these various activities and this was his purpose was creation of ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.586" offset="4193677">And this income is separate and apart from the corporations themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.992" offset="4215306">Salaries, rent, interest are for services and facilities furnished to the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.104" offset="4255744">They are deductible from the corporation's income and as distinguished from dividends where -- which is the part of an investment income which comes to a taxpayer for his ownership in the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.154" offset="4327946">And the dividend is merely a distribution of the corporation's profits for which today the tax laws give recognition to some credit because they say it's a double taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.414" offset="4393044">So I would -- I would say that these activities definitely were pecuniary regular cost to those of other businesses distinguished from just going in from profit and they generate ordinary income separate and apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.135" offset="4483950">Now, the rule the Tax Court however, unfortunately, in spite of these activities rule that you cannot be in the business of promoting, organizing, managing, and financing corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.772" offset="4546435">And I say gave no consideration at all to the extent of leasing operations with the taxpayer unless you form the corporations in our course of language for sale as going businesses to customers in the course of the business of promoting them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.820" offset="4626683">Now, certainly if you did that, that would be one method of creating inco -- ordinary income but it isn't the only method.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.868" offset="4658866">And such a rule is to say the respondent points out to find people who have corporations and inventory ready for sale is a considerably more imaginary than real.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.739" offset="4710379">Furthermore, the extension of the rule that the -- the respondent makes and says that the term dealer and enterprises is used by the Fifth Circuit, the majority in the Fifth Circuit would include the promoter who forms the corporation for a fee is equally unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.162" offset="4796061">The promoter who forms the corporation for a fee and then goes on and forms another corporation is certainly not going to be financing the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.938" offset="4839111">And therefore, no question ever arises under 23 (k), there is no debt and because the very definition of a promoter as used by Professor Valentine in the quotation in his brief is one whose primary purpose is to got out and seek other people who will finance the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.848" offset="4930748">And so not only -- so the rule of the lower courts, we submit, is not only without reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.715" offset="4970245">It is a radical departure from as we point at in the first and second points of our original brief from the established authorities and contrary to the intent of Congress.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1664.055" offset="6759633">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.384" offset="6776874">I would like to recall your attention in the beginning to the precise words of the statute Section 23 (k) of the Revenue Act of 1939 which was inserted in 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.563" offset="6845628">That provides that a loss on a bad debt would be fully deductible from ordinary income if and only if it is a debt -- the loss from which is incurred in the taxpayer's trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.119" offset="6915845">To provide -- to obtain the full deduction therefore, the taxpayer must show not only first, that he was engaged at some point in a trade or business, but also second, that the loss was incurred in that trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.802" offset="6994631">Now, the first requirement of a trade or business plainly cannot be satisfied merely by showing that the taxpayer entered into the transaction with the hope of reaping a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.667" offset="7050010">Now, the tax laws have consistently distinguished between trade or business, a comparatively narrowed term and transactions entered into for profit or income producing transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.011" offset="7107375">A looser term which may or may not include a narrower one but which in any event is frequently used in our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.344" offset="7144782">It's also settled that investing ones money and receiving a return in the form of income or capital gain is not a trade or business, no matter how much time, effort or attention it consumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.622" offset="7217821">The second requirement that the loss be incurred in the trade or business is the rock upon which much of my brother's argument is founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.528" offset="7269439">Mr. Dillingham seeks to bundle up together all these taxpayer's miscellaneous activities including the debt of the resulting loss and then to ask whether or not the petitioner is engaged in a trade or business, but this is only half of necessary inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.328" offset="7352717">Section 23 (k) doesn't say that anyone engaged in a trade or business may deduct any bad debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.827" offset="7390647">It says that the loss must be incurred in the trade or business, and obviously the same man may be both engaged in a trade or business as to part of his activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.024" offset="7439444">And he may be investor as another part or as by may using for an example Mr. Dillingham might do if he were to invest money in the Alaska Wildcat Mining Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.343" offset="7492733">That would not be a loss if it were unfortunate that was incurred in but for tax purposes is the trade or business of practicing law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.866" offset="7698787">To put it little differently, the term capitalist may describe activities some of which constitute engagement in a trade or business or it may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.075" offset="7751659">And I think this is indeed the part to which I was leading up was I think that really here there is no alternative to analyzing the petitioner's activity with those two critical questions in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.573" offset="7813622">Was some relevant part of them trade or business?</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.100" offset="7831803">If the answer is yes, then was the loss incurred in or as part of the activities that constitute trade or business?</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.099" offset="7867747">Not as part of his total and wider activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.796" offset="7882585">So with that in mind I propose first to look at the taxpayer's relations with Mission Orange, his activities there would have view to showing that none of them constituted a trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.526" offset="7945488">And second that if any part of them did constitute a trade or business, the loss was not incurred in that part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.880" offset="7978924">After that, I would like to turn to his other activities and go on to show that they do not affect the case and in dealing with that part of the case, I shall emphasize that whether or not some of them were trade or business such as his partnerships which probably were, the loss was not incurred in connection there with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.368" offset="8072861">Now, as to the fact, the petitioner first became interested in Mission Orange early in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.149" offset="8111940">For about three months, he operated the enterprise as a sole proprietor under that state of course of bottling and distributing soft drinks was his trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.353" offset="8168782">Then in July 1951, in order to avoid the personal liability that would be attendant upon carrying on that trade or business of distributing goods to the public, he transferred -- he formed the Mission Orange Corporation and transferred the assets to the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.730" offset="8230327">And the bottling and distributing of soft drink then became the corporation's trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.073" offset="8275675">And his activities in connection with bottling and distributing soft drinks, producing soft drinks became activities in the corporation's business and the promotion thereof.</text>

            <text syncTime="2061.511" offset="8349445">He made no claim until his reply brief in this Court that he had any arrangement calling for payment or that he intended to get a payment or that he was hoping in the future to get a payment that has been interjected for the first time in the reply brief and I shall deal with it little later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.156" offset="8423946">Originally, he put $25,000 into the company by transferring the assets to it on credit and he had also put in something over $8,000 in the form of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.614" offset="8481834">Then his stock holdings were increased to something between $30,000 and $31,000 and he begged during 1952 and 1953 cash advances totaling about $55,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.356" offset="8544841">So that by December 1, 1953, he had in advance just less than $80,000 to the corporation, quite apart from his stock investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.328" offset="8592697">In December 1953, when the company was apparently already hopelessly insolvent, he put up another $55,000, I think it was, to pay off trade creditors and the assets were all transferred to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.038" offset="8655496">And without stopping to discuss the detail, you'll note that both courts below indicated that this was a separate special transaction which might not qualify regardless of the main one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.449" offset="8705128">During the period, he was the dominant shareholder and president of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.581" offset="8733654">He made important policy decisions, prescribed to business practices and during part of the time he performed the functions of plant manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.570" offset="8773674">He received no salary, as I said earlier, in response to Mr. Justice Stewart's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.248" offset="8800319">Now, this branch of case -- and it is necessary to make some division here, raises the question which we take it that certiorari was granted to resolve, whether a man who organizes one or more corporations, puts money into them as a shareholder and as a large lender manages their business but does all this with the expectation of profiting as a lender and shareholder may nevertheless, when one of the corporations failed, deduct his losses on the debts on the ground that he was engaged in a trade or business and that the loss was incurred in that trade or business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.669" offset="8990072">The petitioner, as you have heard, would answer both questions yes on the ground that there's some difference between an active and a passive investor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.978" offset="9031241">And he is sustained in that by decisions in the First, Eighth Circuits and in the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.647" offset="9070007">We answered no to either or both questions depending on the assumptions, and I think we are squarely sustained by the decisions in the Second, Fifth, and Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.292" offset="9120580">I would like to emphasize two just before we recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.647" offset="9137925">That we think it is quite wrong to speak as if the current of authorities was continuous up until the Revenue Act of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.669" offset="9178049">Commissioner against Smith, a Second Circuit decision which sustained this and which we think is not in any way been overruled or qualified was decided in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.648" offset="9226010">And two cases in this Court, Dalton and Bowers, and Burnett and Clark go all the way back to 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.956" offset="9267179">And we think they sustained us in principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.792" offset="9278568">I'll address myself to that general question first tomorrow morning, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
