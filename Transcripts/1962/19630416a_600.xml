            <label>Mr. Fred E. Weisgal</label>
            <text syncTime="16.232" offset="168312">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.747" offset="186389">This is an appeal from a decision of the Maryland Court of Appeals affirming petitioner's conviction for murder by the Criminal Court of Baltimore City theft, death penalty was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.208" offset="236231">A certiorari was granted by this Court and it was limited to the point raised in Hamilton versus Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.249" offset="264338">The pertinent undisputed facts briefly are that on May 27, 1960 the petitioner was arrested and taken to the Central Police Station in Baltimore City.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.247" offset="308328">This is approximately 12:40 pm and at approximately 6:30 that evening he was booked, which means the charges were placed against him on the docket.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.288" offset="352528">He was brought before a magistrate on May 31, four days later, 3 pm and the state, which usually appears at all of these preliminary hearings, representing this day asked for a postponement at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.438" offset="409161">Postponement was granted and the man was remanded to at that to the Baltimore City Jail where he remained until August 9 when he was again brought before the magistrate for a preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.767" offset="466422">At this preliminary hearing, as is the practice in Maryland, even though the magistrate does not have jurisdiction to try this case, he is asked if he wants to plea guilty or not guilty and the man entered the plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.566" offset="521592">Now come, of course, to the important point that is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.049" offset="535594">This man did not have an attorney representing him either at May 27 or at any time up until this hearing of August 19, still did not have an attorney rather and the magistrate after the preliminary hearing just referred to case sent it up ham as we say in Baltimore, to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.308" offset="608632">An indictment was brought out, and on September 9 be was brought to the criminal court, or September 8, he was brought to criminal court for arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.468" offset="637262">He still did not have an attorney and at that time a plea of not guilty was entered by him by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.950" offset="667146">The court then appointed an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.113" offset="675819">He was re-arraigned on November 25, 1960, at which time through his counsel, he entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.122" offset="723884">The case came to trial on February 28, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.963" offset="739244">It was practically a year later, and during the course of the trial the following testimony took place on page 5 of our brief where the state asked the lieutenant, the arresting officer, Lieutenant Glover, were you present at the preliminary homicide hearing before magistrate Claudney on August 8, 1960 where White was charged with the -- this offence.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.360" offset="828792">I was.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.844" offset="830777">Sir, do you recall what plea, if any, that defended White gave upon his arraignment at that time?</text>
            <text syncTime="186.630" offset="849899">White gave a plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.378" offset="856900">Let me clarify one thing to this court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.065" offset="867662">The use of the arraignment by the State Attorney at that time means -- it does not mean that there was an arraignment as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.500" offset="893367">This was a preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.871" offset="898905">He uses the word arraignment to mean that he appeared before magistrate and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.996" offset="927326">Now this --</text>

            <text syncTime="1296.038" offset="5287476">It is because of this feeling that the institution known as the preliminary hearing exists in the state of Maryland and the primary purpose of the preliminary hearing is for the benefit of the accused, as noted by the Maryland Court of Appeals who are perhaps best qualified to comment on the functions of that particular institution and it might clarify some of the questions raised here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.501" offset="5421328">To quote briefly from a recent case of the Maryland Court of Appeals in which they discussed the preliminary hearing at page 6 of our brief, the case of Williams versus the State in which the court said that this hearing before the magistrate is for the purpose of determining whether there was probable ground to believe the accused guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.885" offset="5506905">The magistrate therefore can only commit the accused who are the -- for the -- for an appearance before the Grand Jury, subject to bail under certain circumstances or discharge him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.771" offset="5558418">The hearing is primarily for the benefit of the accused ensuring him against being committed for action by the Grand Jury on charges which are groundless and this next quotation I believe is of particular interest, “There is no reason, the court said, why the accused should be required to enter a plea at that time, where however, such a plea is voluntarily made by the accused, evidence of the plea is generally held to be admissible in the trial on the indictment.</text>
