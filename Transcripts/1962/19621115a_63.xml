            <label>Mr. W. Francis Marion</label>
            <text syncTime="116.037" offset="567568">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.489" offset="573315">This matter comes before the Court upon a writ of certiorari from the South Carolina Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.582" offset="601736">The question involved is whether in an order of dismissal in a Virginia Court on a custody matter, full faith and credit should have been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.296" offset="644577">Our State Supreme Court gave full faith and credit to an order of dismissal that recited in effect that upon representation of counsel the farthest have reached an agreement and that the case is therefore dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.202" offset="708211">So briefly and factually, the petitioner and Herman Ford or husband and wife got into marital difficulties in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.035" offset="751470">They resided in Sanford, North Carolina at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.591" offset="765785">Both of their homes were in Richmond, Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.918" offset="783026">They went to Richmond, Virginia for purposes of seeing a marriage counsel or psychiatrist.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="176.745" offset="810402">Is Richmond the marriage domicile?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="w_francis_marion" startTime="180.168" stopTime="557.954">
            <label>Mr. W. Francis Marion</label>
            <text syncTime="180.168" offset="824090">No sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.263" offset="828374">Actually, North Carolina was -- I believe they were originally married perhaps in Virginia, Your Honor, in 1952 but they had moved to Sanford, North Carolina after living in various places around the world actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.579" offset="889710">But when they came to Richmond, Virginia for the purposes of seeing the marriage counselor, the respondent, Ford, announced that his wife that he was not going to take her back.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.913" offset="947075">He left three small children at that time, age three, five and seven in Sanford, North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.753" offset="982392">As a result of it, she went back by herself to North Carolina and tried to locate the children and did locate the children and they go to court in the companionship of a German nurse who lived there.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.710" offset="1046235">She brought them back to Richmond, Virginia to the home of her mother in Richmond, Virginia and Ford thereupon instituted a habeas corpus proceeding in the City and County Civil Court of Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.611" offset="1105795">An exchange between counsel followed -- Richmond counsel followed, and as a result of exchange of correspondence, a -- this order of dismissal that was not displayed to the Court, there was no hearing upon the order whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.560" offset="1173608">Just merely that counsel had said to the Court that an agreement had been reached; therefore, the matter is dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.980" offset="1207254">It was thereupon dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.733" offset="1218330">Barbara Ford that was in August of 1959, she subsequently came to Greenville, South Carolina, went to business school, obtained a job in Greenville and in January of 1960, her youngest child was brought to live with her.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.013" offset="1287398">The two older children in the meantime were living in Sanford, North Carolina with the father and the mother-in-law, her mother-in-law.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.701" offset="1330134">That continued until the summer of 1960 at which time, Mrs. Ford, the petitioner, brought in action in the Juvenile Court, Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court in Greenville, South Carolina to obtain custody of the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.179" offset="1400038">Herman Ford, the respondent was served when he came to Greenville to get the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.276" offset="1428459">He was served at that point and a hearing was held in Greenville.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.726" offset="1450297">Now, this was the first time there was a hearing on the merits of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.175" offset="1472031">At the time, 11 witnesses testified including the minister, the -- all the parties involved, and as a result of that, an order was issued by the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court which incidentally has exclusive jurisdiction in this malice under our procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.682" offset="1562102">An order was issued to determine that custody should lie with the mother with reasonable visitation to the father during the holiday period and that is if they could work that part out, but the three smaller children should live with the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.387" offset="1620929">In that -- in the proceeding, the respondent setup before the Domestic Relation judge in his pleadings that this order in Virginia, this order of dismissal was res judicata and that full faith and credit should be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.543" offset="1701595">The Juvenile and Domestic Relations judge in his order went into broader detail as to why he did not feel that full faith -- why it was not res judicata, that it wasn't the hearing on the merits, that it was -- no testimony was taken, and that the best interest of the children were not being served.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.965" offset="1779231">He based his order from the best interest of the three minor children, three, five and seven.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.119" offset="1807862">Though it subsequently appealed to the State Circuit Court which is the intermediate appeal court from this which affirmed the order of the Juvenile Court in every particular -- all of them saying that setting up a specified time the Domestic Relations Court had said that they shall agree as to a time when he could visit.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.722" offset="1894275">He setup certain specified time during the summer and Christmas holidays but otherwise affirmed it and again went into detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.192" offset="1928129">And his order -- the circuit judge, in his order, why this case in Virginia should not be res judicata to the action in South Carolina because the children's interest were not being served in Virginia action, it has never been demonstrated to the Virginia Court what the children -- the rights of the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.435" offset="2017155">They were simply -- as the circuit judge said were raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.797" offset="2038575">Not even before the court in Virginia on a habeas corpus proceeding was not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.482" offset="2061249">The judge never saw him, never took in the testimony of the best interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.838" offset="2078699">And that, in his opinion, the South Carolina order was correct in giving custody to the -- primary custody to the mother, was secondary, in effect, custody to the father because the father would have them in the summertime.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.888" offset="2142960">That was subsequently appealed to our State Supreme Court which held that the order in Virginia should be given full faith and credit that it was a -- it was a proceeding, a judicial proceeding within the meaning of Article IV, Section 1 of the United States Constitution and Section 20, Title 28 that defines -- that full faith and credit should be given and that the orders of the Circuit and the Domestic Relations Court were reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.432" offset="2277125">We filed a writ of certiorari and it was granted upon that basis that full faith and credit should not be given.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.004" offset="2311398">Basically, we have three -- setup three reasons where why any of which, we submit --</text>

            <text syncTime="596.053" offset="2487568">I think that the United -- the North Carolina Court was without jurisdiction at that time to do so and we specifically objected to the jurisdiction of the North Carolina Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.734" offset="2530304">Now after there was a divorce action brought by Herman Ford, after the rendition of the order of the Juvenile Court in South Carolina, in other words, that he was there in personam in South Carolina, fought the case -- litigated the case and lost it.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.432" offset="2609089">He then, under the North Carolina statute, brought a divorce action which he had a right to do because they were at the time domiciled in North Carolina on the grounds of adultery.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.527" offset="2661439">That was a suit was filed denying that.</text>

            <text syncTime="664.587" offset="2761749">Certainly, they have a section in North Carolina that has the two-year separation which after the end of two years, that was -- she did not contest to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.365" offset="2800828">In other words, filed an appearance through counsel not contested the divorce, all of which were subsequent to this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.217" offset="2836250">The counsel for respondent in their brief commented this was forced by the defendant or the respondent -- the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.799" offset="2874598">He forced that action into trial, the only action that was forced to trial was it was apparent on that action -- divorce action in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.746" offset="2914408">And that action was pushed to trial at the end of two years to get it off the docket one way or the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1053.701" offset="4318124">In other words, if the Court can amend in Virginia, if Virginia Court can amend its order, then the South Carolina Court can amend its order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.946" offset="4367130">That is the Virginia order to award custody under Halvey against Halvey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.428" offset="4389073">The third ground and I think in this instance is the most important ground and I'll put them in the inverse is that the Virginia order was not a judicial proceeding within the meaning of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution, because there was no hearing, no testimony, it was simply an order of dismissal, voluntary dismissal, we submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.380" offset="4504848">And that as a result of that, the South Carolina Court would not have to give full faith and credit because in Virginia, the Virginia Court itself would not find that the original action was res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.082" offset="4575692">Now, all of these that the law relating to this custody matter in full faith and credit is, frankly, somewhat up in the air under the decision of May against Anderson and the Kovacs against Brewer and State against Halvey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.937" offset="4663150">We submit though, that basically, the order in Virginia was an order of dismissal whether it was a 'dismissed agreed' as counsel for respondent claim and a 'dismissed agreed' by way of regression of the minute under Virginia law is what I would call a non-suit with prejudice, that you are non-suiting yourself with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.978" offset="4767326">We submit that whether it was a simple order of dismissal or ‘dismissed agreed' order that the Virginia Court would have the right to review that order for the best interest of the children.</text>

            <text syncTime="1227.200" offset="5012146">The Virginia law has clearly, we submit, a 'dismissed agreed' section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.067" offset="5043597">There are four cases that we found in this in the Virginia courts that had a ‘dismissed agreed' order which is an order with prejudice, all involving contractual relationships, none of which involved domestic relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.062" offset="5111620">That is custody matters at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.425" offset="5121024">There are a number of cases and we have cited them in our brief, particularly at page 12 of our brief, the Martin against Martin and (Inaudible) several cases relating to custody matters where the Court reviewed its own order and opened up an order for trial for prior adjudication of the matter even if it was in adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.512" offset="5241396">Now, basically, I'll go back to the point and I can't stress it too much in my own mind that this original habeas corpus action was -- there was no hearing on the merits, no -- nobody appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.961" offset="5299179">So there's some question of whether that was actually adjudication of the matter, but assuming, for the sake of argument that it was an adjudication, then under Virginia law, we submit, under the Semmes case, the Semmes and a wrap of cases, the Court could review its own order and a man in any way it's all fair under change of condition or change of circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="2175.433" offset="8805125">I submit that there is an extensive recitation of the facts in the opinion of the South Carolina Supreme Court and I will not belabor that particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.009" offset="8851414">The facts in the record, there had been substantial or extensive statements made by petitioner in her brief, also by respondent in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.143" offset="8899897">I say that at the beginning, there was a custody proceeding in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.728" offset="8930304">It was a habeas corpus proceeding that was instituted for the custody of these minor children and that is the proper proceedings in Virginia to obtain and to determine the custody of the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.721" offset="9002297">Following the custody proceeding in Virginia and the order ‘dismissed agreed', under which agreement and order, the children or the primary custody of the children was given to the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.475" offset="9069275">It was some time following that that the petitioner moved to Greenville, South Carolina, and at that point, because of the question of Mr. Justice Black with respect to the length of time, these children had been in Greenville, I wish to state what the record will show and what is the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.080" offset="9163734">It was sometime in late February of 1960 when the respondent here, the father, agreed for the three-year-old child to stay for a period of time with the mother in Greenville, South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.801" offset="9234578">However, that child, the youngest child, returned to the custody of the father as provided under the order ‘dismissed agreed' and the agreement in Virginia to the father at the end of May, and the three children did not come to Greenville, South Carolina to see their mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.670" offset="9322036">Under the terms of this agreement which the father, respondent, scrupulously obeyed until the latter part of June, 1960, and it was within approximately six weeks following that that the mother instituted this action in Greenville for the custody of these children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.504" offset="9425377">And as the record will show, it happened upon an occasion when the father had come to Greenville to see his children and to tell them of the death of his mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.279" offset="9472502">And at that time, he was served with process and this action was instituted in the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Greenville County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.629" offset="9509909">Following upon the order of that court, the matter was appealed to the Court of Common Pleas.</text>

            <text syncTime="2366.056" offset="9567587">There was an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.334" offset="9580753">I disagree with my able friend that the jurisdiction of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court is exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.899" offset="9610951">The Court of Common Pleas is a Court of general jurisdiction in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.696" offset="9630177">Its powers are vested by the Constitution and that power cannot be and has not been cut down or diminished by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.886" offset="9666957">The Court of Common Pleas then gave according to the words of its decree joint custody and expressly put custody in both towns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.906" offset="9722964">However, the Court of Common Pleas did not recognize or accept the defense that the respondent had then opposed as to the Virginia decree being a valid decree and being res judicata to the issues that were in the South Carolina Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.215" offset="9800182">Following upon that decree of the Court of Common Pleas, there was the appeal to the Supreme Court of South Carolina and that Court issued its opinion and following upon that we are here pursuant to the petitioners and this Court's order of certiorari to the South Carolina Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.160" offset="9888057">At that point, if I may, I wished to make certain of the correctness of what transpired in North Carolina and particularly Queen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.706" offset="9934242">The action in North Carolina which was undisputedly the marital domicile of the parties and of these children, the action in North Carolina was instituted by the respondent here in December of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.239" offset="10024312">That was an action in the Superior Court of Lee County, North Carolina for divorce and custody of the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.908" offset="10059003">That action was instituted at a time when the order of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court had just been issued but when the children were in North Carolina with their father, the respondent, pursuant to and under the terms of the agreed order of dismissal and the agreement in the Virginia Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.828" offset="10154715">Now, that action in North Carolina did not come on to trial until this past August of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.773" offset="10218454">The action, as I have stated, was instituted prior to the appeal to the Court of Common Pleas in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.783" offset="10254503">But there was only one action instituted in the Superior Court of North Carolina at the marital domicile and that action was for divorce and custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.060" offset="10299643">There has never been any separation of the actions and a separation of the counts if they might be termed that and that action, we submit, was brought to trial upon the motion of petitioner's counsel in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.289" offset="10380518">And that motion is printed at page 64 that is the order of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.384" offset="10408939">And the Superior Court of Lee County, North Carolina, the order of the Court pursuant to petitioner's motion is printed on page 64 of the appendix to respondent's briefs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3522.717" offset="14194291">There was no contention of that and it was so stated into the record in the trial of the North Carolina case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.868" offset="14226892">And the South Carolina Supreme Court, as I have heretofore stated, held that there was neither allegation nor proof of a change of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.490" offset="14273285">We think that to view this matter, we think that the question as set forth on page 1 in the question presented in the brief of respondent is a proper statement of the question before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.844" offset="14334725">And to view from there, we say that we must look and see what was held by the South Carolina Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.083" offset="14375685">If I may point that up quickly we say first, that the South Carolina Supreme Court held that the Virginia order was ‘dismissed agreed', a ‘dismissed agreed' order under the Virginia practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.506" offset="14429393">Second, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that the judgment was res judicata in Virginia of the issues before the Virginia Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.384" offset="14468890">Third, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that Virginia courts would recognize and be bound by the decree in the absence of changed circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.408" offset="14516955">Fourth, the South Carolina Supreme Court determined the South Carolina law and held that upon a proper showing, the Court could make a further disposition of the child if new facts and circumstances made it desirable or proper for the best interest of the child and expressly held that a judicial award of custody of a child is never final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.876" offset="14614862">Then the South Carolina Supreme Court applied the South Carolina rule to that holding and held that the entire record contained neither allegations nor proof of a change of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.685" offset="14670137">The South Carolina Court further held that the ‘dismissed agreed' order of the Virginia Court was a bar to this action between the same parties for the same cause in the absence of any change of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.796" offset="14734608">We think that the South Carolina Supreme Court reached the same result in its opinion that would have been reached by application of the Full Faith and Credit Clause or by rules of committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.151" offset="14800018">Therefore, the petitioner alleges here a constitutional question on the premise that the South Carolina Supreme Court held that it was precluded from inquiring into the best interest of the welfare of the minor children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.797" offset="14882565">They contend that the South Carolina Court held that it was precluded by the Virginia decree and we submit that that is not the finding of the South Carolina Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.841" offset="14934706">The South Carolina Court held that the South Carolina law would be properly applied here, it did apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.559" offset="14977651">Now, we say that what they would attempt to do is to say that it was not res judicata and he said, not res judicata even if it was ‘dismissed agreed' and the Virginia cases to which they would point and one I believe that would come the closest to it would be the Buchanan case which is cited in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.809" offset="15074617">And I particularly call the Court's attention there that those cases which they cited referred to a contract made in Virginia prior to the institution of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.819" offset="15118608">That is not the case here as to what happened in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.462" offset="15137207">Here, the agreement was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.067" offset="15147656">It was negotiated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.493" offset="15153298">It was part and parcel of the order ‘dismissed agreed' of the Virginia Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.378" offset="15184854">Now, with respect to parens patriae, we submit to this Court that parens patriae has no place when -- no standing, when in direct conflict with a mandate of the Constitution, we further say that here, the South Carolina Supreme Court carefully examined the record and supplied the very thing that the Kovacs case in the opinion by Mr. Justice Black was sent back to North Carolina to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.922" offset="15335111">Here, the South Carolina went into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.749" offset="15346395">It founded according to its own law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.872" offset="15358830">It applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3815.536" offset="15365517">And that very deficiency or the reason that this Court sent back the Kovacs case here -- is applied in the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.715" offset="15406268">We contend in conclusion that under the mandate of the -- of the Constitution, the mandate of Article IV Section 1 that it is equally as strong with respect to a child custody case as to other cases because a custody decree is a judicial decree and it cannot be stated otherwise and there is no exception in the mandate of the Constitution with respect to a custody decree.</text>
