            <text syncTime="14.795" offset="162565">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of North Carolina and presents principally a well-defined and circumscribed issue and that is whether in the particular legal and factual context of these sit-in demonstrations the arrest, conviction and sentence to prison of students, or the petitioners here, denied to them equal protection of the law secured by the Fourteenth Amendment and whether these judgments of conviction should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.821" offset="298611">At the outset, before stating the facts and elaborating their legal argument, petitioners would like briefly to outline the principle elements of this case which as we stated circumscribe and define the issues here and those elements are that in this case we have first of all state action in the form of an arrest, trial, conviction and unless these convictions are reversed an actual sentence to prison.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>

            <text syncTime="87.039" offset="451480">And two of them, the young ladies involved, the prayer for judgment was suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.840" offset="482722">Secondly, this state action enforced racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.946" offset="511143">Thirdly, in this case, there has been conceded by the State to exist in North Carolina a statewide custom of racial segregation and we submit this custom has been fostered and infused by a complex network of state segregation laws, including an ordinance of the City of Durham requiring racial segregation in restaurant facilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="136.911" offset="651055">Fourth, the State trial conviction and so forth that I've mentioned protected and asserted property right of Kress' Dime Store.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.350" offset="696822">And this so-called property right upon analysis turns out only to be an asserted right to exclude Negroes and their white companions from a single unseverable portion of an establishment open to the general public in which these very petitioners were welcome to trade except at that particular counter while being seated.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.141" offset="779891">Fifth, the premises in question were extensively licensed and regulated by the State with respect to its service of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.816" offset="814686">And finally, the State of North Carolina contrary to the assumptions made by this Court in the Civil Rights cases does not protect persons against racial discrimination in the premises in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.651" offset="865991">Petitioners submit that these very well defined considerations typical to a very substantial extent of almost all of the sit-in cases to find the issues presented to this Court in a way which makes unnecessary for a decision any of the great variety of hypothetical cases imagined by legal writers and opposing counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.303" offset="944567">This case therefore does not involve state enforced racial segregation in private homes or country clubs.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.966" offset="971212">It doesn't involve discrimination against persons because they may be redheads or personally disliked, personal enemies nor does it involve the extent to which the Fourteenth Amendment applies to the law of trusts in the States and so forth and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.937" offset="1027114">Such hypothetical cases would call into play countervailing constitutional consideration such as rights of privacy and so forth none of which are involved in the case now at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.881" offset="1070895">This case involves only the combination of the legal and factual circumstances of this type of sit-in which I said is typical of virtually all the sit-in cases not only here but throughout the country.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.316" offset="1616645">Kress' as I stated earlier serves Negroes and whites without discrimination throughout its various 50 counters in the store except at a seated service lunch counter.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="412.255" offset="1752377">I would think so Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.464" offset="1757184">In discussing the application of the ordinance to this case, I plan to discuss that because our point is the ordinance in this case is not involved in the technical orthodox legal way that an ordinance might be involved in such a case, but more as an expression of community policy as it affected the situation because in fact the manager was not and no one has ever enforced the ordinance at that stand-up lunch counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.397" offset="1844955">And the manager himself testified that it was the custom of the community he was following and unlike in the Peterson case in South Carolina where both the manager and police stated they were relying on the ordinance and the Gober case out of Birmingham where there was an effort to develop the significance of the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.168" offset="1908067">In the Durham case, neither the State nor the petitioners view the case as involving the ordinance in the normal -- in its normal legal application because the manager in fact was not obeying it at stand-up counters.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.394" offset="1956968">So we feel the ordinance plays a different kind of role in this case than it does in the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.248" offset="1976404">There was a sign at the lunch counter staying invited guests and employees only but no invitations were sent out as the manager states.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.223" offset="2000227">He just said that white persons automatically were considered guests and Negroes were not and Negroes and their white friends were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.776" offset="2030425">Racial discrimination was the custom of the community in North Carolina and that's why the manager said that he was segregating.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.925" offset="2067101">On page 22 of the record, he said that, “It is the policy of our store to wait on customers dependent upon the customs of the community.”</text>
            <text syncTime="499.385" offset="2100955">And lower down on that page, it said, “even if Negroes accompanied by white people were orderly at our luncheonette because of the policy of the community, we would not serve them,” and that was our policy prior to May 6 in various other places in the record, page 23 and 44, he said the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.813" offset="2162604">The Negro students who ordered were not served.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.082" offset="2175666">One of their white companions, a girl purchased some food and handed it to a Negro companion and she was asked to leave also.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.670" offset="2202102">They were all asked to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.168" offset="2208057">While they remain seated, the police arrived.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.309" offset="2216626">It's not clear who called them, asked the petitioners to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.882" offset="2226866">When they did not, they were arrested for trespass.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.456" offset="2237210">The petitioners for a long time have been customers of the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.480" offset="2253302">They were at this time sitting in as part of an informal student organization to protest segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.307" offset="2276603">They did not desire to be arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.297" offset="2284544">They did not expect to be arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.218" offset="2292276">They were hopeful that the policy of the store would change.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.981" offset="2307323">They were indicted under a North Carolina statute which appears on page 2 of our brief which states, “Trespass on land after being forbidden.”</text>
            <text syncTime="562.480" offset="2353298">If any person after being forbidden to do so shall go -- enter upon the lands of another without a license therefore, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and so forth and we plan -- we have argued in our brief and if there's time plan to argue orally that this statute could not possibly get any notice that what these people had done was a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="5753.990" offset="23119287">That's true that the court order has not yet -- there has not yet been a hearing on the order, but there has been a unanimous decision of the Fourth Circuit following three years of litigation during which they kept separate school zones and they still have them at this time so far as I know.</text>
            <text syncTime="5768.018" offset="23175398">Secondly, the main point that I'm afraid that I got away from during the argument was that this is not a case involving redheads or Hatfields or McCoys.</text>
            <text syncTime="5778.076" offset="23215626">This is a case involving the question of racial segregation and I would like just to read a few sentences from the conclusion of the Shelley opinion which I think is crucial here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5787.447" offset="23253138">That is that the historical context in which the Fourteenth Amendment became a part of the Constitution should not be forgotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="5794.014" offset="23279470">Whatever else the framers sought to achieve, it is clear that the matter of primary concern with the establishment of equality in the enjoyment of basic civil and political rights and the preservation of those rights from discriminatory action on the part of the states based on considerations of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="5811.181" offset="23348120">75 years ago, this Court announced that the provisions of the amendment are to be construed with this fundamental purpose in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="5818.085" offset="23375705">And we submit as we did at the outset that there is more state action here than in Shelley and the state action bites more deeply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5824.710" offset="23402245">Here the courts have not held themselves open to persons who have agreed to discriminate and said that we will implement your agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5831.617" offset="23429831">Here, the State has taken an active initiative in prosecuting and trying these students and it threatens as I said to send to jail unless these judgments are reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5842.581" offset="23473716">Shelley, I was said involved some sort of a two-party contract in which both parties agree but that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5847.962" offset="23495241">Shelley was a tripartite or there were more people involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5850.603" offset="23505795">Those covenanters were involved in the contract too and they had a property right too and their so-called property right was the right to insist upon racial discrimination on the part of the buyer and the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="5861.013" offset="23547382">And it was that that this Court held could not be enforced through the courts and to that extent, Shelley is similar to this and also the statute that supposedly was -- statute was involved in the Shelley speaks of personal property as well as real property as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="5876.791" offset="23610493">There was a question about the innkeepers' law in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="5880.364" offset="23624808">The law of innkeepers in North Carolina State -- in State against Steele at 106, 766 -- North Carolina 766 and racial discrimination is an exception to the innkeeper's rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="5892.232" offset="23672351">An innkeeper can keep out a person on the grounds of race if he so desires. Guests of a hotel and travelers or other persons entering it with a bona fide intent of the coming guest cannot be lawfully prevented from going in or be put out by force and so from the so on, unless they be persons of bad or suspicious character or a vulgar habit are so objectionable to the patrons of the house on account of the race to which they belong and so forth.</text>
