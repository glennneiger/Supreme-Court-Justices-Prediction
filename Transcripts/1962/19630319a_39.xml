            <text syncTime="99.724" offset="502262">This Section of the Immigration and Nationality Act provides for deportation for past membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.305" offset="528593">And the chief issue in this case is whether or not that finding can be -- that holding can be supported on the basis of the findings made by the Board of Immigration Appeals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.574" offset="577703">The findings upon which the order of deportation rests were set forth and summarized by the BIA and that's quoted in our brief at page 5 to 6, these are the essential findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.616" offset="633814">According to the BIA, membership in the Communist Party was found to have been established on the testimony of Government witness, Scarletto, who testified that he had collected Communist Party dues from the respondent and had attended close meetings of the Communist Party with him, and the general corroboration offered by the testimony of Government witness, Elorriaga.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.625" offset="749902">There were no findings beyond this as to the nature of petitioner's membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.785" offset="770487">There were no findings that the petitioner had ever engaged in any Party activity of any kind, or that he had ever said anything at any party meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.541" offset="809566">Simply, there's bare finding that he had attended some meetings and had paid dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.400" offset="832972">The Board of Immigration Appeals nevertheless held that on these findings, that petitioner was deportable within the requirements of this Court's decision in Rowoldt and I digress for a moment, this Court held in the Rowoldt case, that aliens who were only nominal members of the Party were not deportable and that it was necessary to establish deportability to show a “meaningful association” with the Party.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Rein</label>
            <text syncTime="247.948" offset="1095137">Not to witness Elorriaga, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.937" offset="1107153">The witness, Elorriaga, if I may digress for a moment, testified in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.418" offset="1133066">He testified at one point that the petitioner attended meetings regularly, I think three or four times a month over a period of three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.134" offset="1167862">At another point in his testimony, the same witness testified that over a period of three years, he saw the petitioner at a total of two meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.742" offset="1214360">Now, what is significant is that the Board of Immigration Appeals in its opinion, recognizing the conflict in this testimony, said, “We find it unnecessary to resolve this conflict, because under our view, it doesn't make any difference whether he attended two meetings or meetings regularly, he is still a member of the Communist Party, and in any event, we will only consider this witness, Elorriaga to be corroborative of the witness, Scarletto.”</text>
            <text syncTime="306.740" offset="1330343">From the portion I have just read to you, they relied upon the witness, Scarletto and said that Elorriaga is merely corroborative.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.797" offset="1366601">So you have two points, I say both reading the witness fairly, there is no such evidence, and secondly, and perhaps more decisive, I think for this Court, this Court has repeatedly said and most recently in the Burlington Truck Lines case that when a case comes here from an administrative agency, it will examine it on the basis of the findings made by the administrative agency and not go beyond it.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.141" offset="1467956">Now, the Board of Immigration Appeals made no finding that the petitioner here had attended any executive meetings of the club.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.095" offset="1499721">The sole finding on the basis of all Elorriaga's testimony was that they were considered to be merely corroborative in view of the great contradiction in his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.026" offset="1539427">So I think it's fair to say and although the Government disputes it and I have discussed their statements in my reply brief at some length, but I think there is no question that on the BIA findings, all that there is before this Court and all that there is before the BIA, and all that the BIA thought it had was attendance at some meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.041" offset="1623542">And as I point out these meetings were not more than about possibly 15 meetings over a period of two years and payment of dues and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.278" offset="1668472">Now, the BIA said and recognizing the force of the Rowoldt case that one of the prime indicia that must be examined in the Rowoldt case to see whether or not there was the necessary “meaningful association” was the alien's awareness of the political implications of his membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.733" offset="1750288">The BIA recognized that and in its opinion, it stated, that there was little development of the respondent's awareness of the fact that he belonged to a political organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.964" offset="1803264">As I indicate that that really is an overstatement because there was no development of the respondent's awareness.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.759" offset="1830431">Nevertheless, according to the BIA, the petitioner was deportable, and it arrived at that conclusion on the following theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.359" offset="1864808">On the theory that once the Government had shown a bare organizational membership, it was permissible to draw an inference that there was a “meaningful association” and the BIA would presume a “meaningful association” unless the alien came forward and demonstrated to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.894" offset="1950908">In other words, the way they view the case was that once there was bare organizational membership, the burden of proof as to the character of that membership rested upon the petitioner and not upon the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.264" offset="2012453">We brought a complaint originally in the United States District Court to challenge the validity of the deportation order in that theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.748" offset="2042337">The District Court gave judgment for the Government and on appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.474" offset="2069295">Now, the Court of Appeals affirmed agreeing with the Board of Immigration Appeals' theory that a presumption can be drawn from bare organizational membership, but it arrived at this result by a very novel and unprecedented route which was quite different from the one that the Board of Immigration Appeals had arrived at.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.692" offset="2150170">In essence, what the Court of Appeals held was as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.153" offset="2167933">It read the various statutes on this subject and this Court's opinions as coming to the following conclusion that prior to the 1950 Act and going back to the 1940 Act, the Court said, “It was necessary to establish deportability to show that the alien involved had personally advocated the overthrow of Government by force and violence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="541.880" offset="2270856">It then said that the 1950 Act which provided the deportation on membership alone or did it as follows, that Congress made a legislative finding, that the Communist Party advocated the overthrow of the Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.694" offset="2342118">It then established a legislative presumption that all members of the Communist Party advocated the overthrow of Government by force and violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.166" offset="2380048">And that the force of this Court's decision in Rowoldt case was that that presumption was a rebuttable.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.331" offset="2416724">We petitioned the Court for certiorari from that opinion of the Court of Appeals pointing out the novel nature of the opinion and what seemed to be a faulty analysis of this Court's previous decisions in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.604" offset="2465834">The Government represented, we say erroneously and they're still apparently maintaining the same misconstruction of the record that the Court had merely evaluated the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.659" offset="2514004">Now, there's nothing in the Court's opinion could show that they were merely evaluating testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.427" offset="2533125">In any event, this Court denied certiorari at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.906" offset="2554964">The net result of that was that under the Court of Appeals decision which by virtue of this Court's denial of certiorari, became the final law of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.180" offset="2596133">The petitioner was to be deported because he had failed to rebut the presumption that he had personally advocated the violent overthrow of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.855" offset="2638764">Since prior to that ruling, neither petitioner nor the Service knew or had a reason to know that such evidence relating to the petitioner's personal advocacy was at all relevant to the issue, petitioner requested the Board of Immigration Appeals to reopen his case so as to give him an opportunity to prove that he never personally advocated the violent overthrow of the Government and hence was not deportable under the Court of Appeals' decision and the theory of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.139" offset="2767914">He supported this motion with an affidavit to the effect that he had never advocated or espoused violent overthrow of the Government and stated that if the hearing were reopened, he would so testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.790" offset="2818487">The Board of Immigration Appeals granted oral argument on this petition to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.980" offset="2839280">After argument, it denied the petition to reopen on the ground that under the decisions of this Court, evidence as to whether or not the petitioner affirmatively himself espoused violent overthrow is not material to deportability.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.808" offset="2910647">It disposed of the opinion of the Court of Appeals' decision on the ground that the Court of Appeals' decision which justified petitioner's motion was inconsistent with the decisions of this Court and we concede that, as a matter of fact, we pointed that out in our original petition.</text>

            <text syncTime="894.344" offset="3680737">The law of the case doctrine makes it perfectly clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.013" offset="3691395">As a matter of fact, that the erroneous decision of the Court of Appeals was not even binding on the Court of Appeals and it's certainly not binding on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.455" offset="3725145">But to turn then for the question of what is the heart of the case as to whether or not on these facts, the -- the petition that comes within the Rowoldt case, I'll turn now to argue that.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.627" offset="3777912">Rowoldt against Perfetto established that the statutory provision which provides for deportation for past membership in the Communist Party applies only to membership which has a certain political significance described as a “meaningful association.”</text>
            <text syncTime="937.743" offset="3854294">Aliens whose membership was only nominal and which lacked the “meaningful association” are not deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.223" offset="3888253">In Rowoldt itself, the alien belonged to the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.039" offset="3907480">There was much language which the Government emphasizes in its brief about how the Board found that the petitioner here voluntarily joined the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.272" offset="3944469">There is no question that Rowoldt voluntarily joined the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.557" offset="3957635">He belonged to the Party for about a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.416" offset="3969024">He attended closed party meetings.</text>

            <text syncTime="988.335" offset="4056691">The majority said that he belonged to the Party for about a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.625" offset="4073827">He paid dues and he ran a Party bookstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.500" offset="4089396">These findings were nonetheless held insufficient to establish the “meaningful association” which was a requisite for deportability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.476" offset="4125236">A further gloss on the Court's opinion in Rowoldt was given by this Court in the subsequent case of Scales against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.239" offset="4160345">That case which was a criminal case involved the construction of the term “member” as used in the criminal provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.897" offset="4190960">He was not necessarily member of the Communist Party, member of an organization advocating the overthrow of Government by force and violence but it involved the construction of the meaning of that word “member”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.816" offset="4234637">This Court, relying on its previous decisions in Galvan and in Rowoldt, held that the 10-member must be confined to only active members and that it cannot be applied to nominal members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.741" offset="4298376">In the course of its opinion, the Court pointed out that Rowoldt, in relying on Rowoldt, would not permit deportation solely on the ground of a voluntary joining of the Party and it argued that a similar construction would certainly be applied to the criminal portion of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.260" offset="4376430">It is significant and I think the Court, it's worthwhile to note that the language, so far as the word “member” is concerned, both as was used in the provision of the Smith Act involved in Scales, and both as used here in the deportation provision, both trace their origin back to the Alien Registration Act of 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.815" offset="4462634">They both really go back to the same statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.028" offset="4479457">It is plain that the findings of the Board of Immigration Appeals, which I have quoted, cannot possibly satisfy this term of “meaningful association” or active membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.688" offset="4530134">Since the Board found only the petitioner attended some Party meetings and paid dues and no more and this in fact was less than was found in Rowoldt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.770" offset="4578408">To turn very briefly to the Government's contention as to the -- what the facts are that might support other findings; they say -- as I started to say earlier, our first answer to that, would be that this Court ordinarily reviews administrative findings -- administrative orders on the basis of the findings made by the Board of Immigration of -- by the administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.732" offset="4694288">It does not go behind it to see whether or not the agency could have made other findings and could have acted on another theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.501" offset="4729396">I think that that matter was put very succinctly, very recently by this Court in the Burlington Truck case saying that the Court would not have recognized appellate counsel's post hoc argument as to the rationalization of an agency's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.055" offset="4799613">But leaving that aside, we turn to what the Government says, “The Board could have found even if we want to look into the record.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.063" offset="4835662">They say first, that the petitioner was an active member of the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.335" offset="4856665">Now, the Board never found the petitioner was active and unless you say that because he attended meetings and paid dues, he was an active member, it adds nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.201" offset="4904208">There is no evidence of any activity and indeed, the Government points to none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.562" offset="4929599">It then argues that he was a regular member of the Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.980" offset="4947257">Now significantly, it talks constantly throughout its brief about the testimony of two witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.670" offset="4974007">As I have pointed out, the Board relied only on one indicating that the other witness because of the big cut -- the complete contradiction in this testimony could be considered only corroborative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.899" offset="5018937">That witness, one Scarletto, testified and this is Scarletto's testimony, that petitioner just went once in a while to Party meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.654" offset="5061987">He testified, and if you want to really look at the testimony that his Communist Party Club in which both he and the petitioner were members, met regularly once a week at the home of a different member of the club.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.506" offset="5113396">Nevertheless, over the two-year period, he could recall seeing petitioner at the most at maybe 15 meetings or he wasn't sure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2927.482" offset="11813282">The Court later recognized that it would sustain what it considered to be purely historical reasons.</text>

Turning now to what Mr. Rein says is the issue in the case, and that is whether the evidence was sufficient under the standards laid down by this Court in Galvan, Rowoldt, and Niukkanen, not merely in Rowoldt because Rowoldt doesn't purport to create a new standard, purports to follow the standard in Galvan and Niukkanen also purports to follow the standard in Galvan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.401" offset="14025017">That under those standards, whether there was reasonable substantial and probative evidence as Section 242 of the 1952 Act requires to sustain petitioner's deportation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3501.660" offset="14109968">It's reasonable, substantial and probative evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.767" offset="14122402">And under Rowoldt, in Galvan, and Niukkanen, that would be reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence of meaningful membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.802" offset="14162631">Now, at the start, I'd like to emphasize that this issue has already been fully litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.176" offset="14188126">The Board of Immigration Appeals found that the evidence was sufficient under the standard in Galvan in the first deportation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3530.477" offset="14225324">After Rowoldt had been determined by this Court, the Board held that the evidence established meaningful membership in the Communist Party under the standards laid down in the Galvan decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.399" offset="14281017">In making this determination, the Board did not rely as petitioner contends on petitioner's mere membership in the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.692" offset="14318111">Instead the Board emphasized and this is -- Mr. Justice Goldberg pointed out that the actual findings are at page 2 of the record that after peti -- petitioner's active participation in Communist Party affairs, which the Board emphasized was totally unexplained unlike in the Rowoldt decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.589" offset="14397733">And the Board's determination was sustained in the face of explicit attacks on the sufficiency of the evidence by the District Court, the Court of Appeals, and then in the denial of certiorari by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.822" offset="14454680">After the Board refused to reopen the deportation proceedings for a second time, petitioner again attacked the sufficiency of the evidence in the District Court and the Court of Appeals, and both of these courts again denied these contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.217" offset="14508283">This Court has repeatedly held that it will not reassess administrative findings of fact which have been carefully considered by the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.879" offset="14542869">And we submit that it follows a fortiori in this case, that in the absence of the plainest kind of error, that the prior review of the Board's findings of fact in litigation which came through the District Court, the Court of Appeals, and to the -- this Court, the Highest Court in the land, should be conclusive here.</text>

            <text syncTime="6493.715" offset="26078229">Now, if he comes in and says as in Rowoldt that I joined the Communist Party for nonpolitical reasons, then the standard which the Board applies in evaluating that evidence like the Government's evidence is the Government had the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="6508.317" offset="26136639">We do not say and as far as I know, none of the -- the Board did not say it, that the burden of proof shifted to the alien in the sense that he had to prove something by substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6522.539" offset="26193481">Now, I'd like to turn finally to the Scales decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6527.881" offset="26214902">And this as members of the Court have indicated the Scales decision did not involve as to the facts which were before it, deportation and all involved the criminal prosecution under the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6539.452" offset="26261191">And we don't believe that a modification in the standards for deportation which involves an entirely different statute and in fact an entirely different constitutional basis should be inferred from the Court's opinion in Scales unless the Court made that modification extremely clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="6558.417" offset="26337050">Now, all that the Court said in Scales and this is what petitioner relies on, this Court in passing on a similar provision requiring the deportation of aliens will become members of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="6574.604" offset="26401834">The provision which rested on Congress is far more plenary power over aliens and hence did not press nearly so closely on the limits of constitutionality as this enactment that is the -- the Smith Act, had no difficulty in interpreting membership there as a meaning -- as meaning more than the mere voluntary listing of a person's name on party roles.</text>
            <text syncTime="6597.209" offset="26492217">Then the Court cited Galvan and Rowoldt.</text>
            <text syncTime="6600.678" offset="26506115">A similar construction is called for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6604.328" offset="26520639">Now, we say that all these sentence means, all these two sentences mean is what the Government concedes that more than mere membership is required both for deportation and for a prosecution under the Smith Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6618.351" offset="26576750">Now, we submit there's no basis for believing that this Court sub silentio in dictum overruled Galvan and Rowoldt and Niukkanen.</text>
            <text syncTime="6628.507" offset="26617396">But even if Scales did modify those cases, we submit that the evidence here as to active membership was sufficient under the test laid down in Scales.</text>
            <text syncTime="6638.658" offset="26658043">The Court said in Scales that the element of activity in the proscribed membership stands apart from the gradient of guilty knowledge in that the former, that is activity, may be shown by defendant's participation in general party affairs whereas the latter, the guilty knowledge requires linking him with the Party's illegal activities and we think the evidence here is plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="6662.779" offset="26754487">The petitioner did actively participate in general party affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6667.624" offset="26773817">He paid dues, he attended numerous closed meetings of his unit, he attended a party convention and attended executive sessions for his Party unit, and he was apparently an officer of the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6680.267" offset="26824391">Therefore, we submit that the Board applied proper legal standards, the standards laid down in Galvan and Rowoldt in finding the petitioner was a meaningful member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="6691.515" offset="26869426">This finding is twice been upheld by the District Court and twice been upheld by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="6697.355" offset="26892831">We submit that the lower courts were correct, that the Board's determination, the petitioner was a meaningful member of the Communist Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="6704.936" offset="26923133">It's supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence, which is what Section 242 of the Act requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="6712.805" offset="26954585">And therefore, the Government submits that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Rein</label>
            <text syncTime="6721.089" offset="26987708">I'd like briefly to discuss the point about the actual findings of the Board of Immigration Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="6728.061" offset="27015607">As Mr. Terris has indicated, the Board first made its findings before Rowoldt.</text>
            <text syncTime="6733.937" offset="27039117">The petition for reopen was filed asking it to reconsider the case in the base -- on the basis of Rowoldt or at least to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="6742.362" offset="27072867">And it's significant that in that decision, in which it considered the meaning of Rowoldt, this is what the Board said it had found and what its findings were.</text>
            <text syncTime="6752.700" offset="27114141">And here are findings at page -- it appears at page 6 of the transcript, membership in the Communist Party was found to have been established on the testimony of Government witness, Scarletto, who testified that he had collected Communist Party dues from the respondent and had attended closed meetings of the Communist Party with him, and the general corroboration offered by the testimony of Government witness, Elorriaga.</text>
            <text syncTime="6779.215" offset="27220198">Those are your findings are meant, the Board goes on to say at page 8, there was little development of the respondent's awareness of the fact that he belonged to a political organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="6791.733" offset="27270353">When the case went back, it wasn't at the question of the respondent not offering evidence, the Government offered no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="6798.847" offset="27298774">And mind you, in this particular case, they had a witness who was an undercover informant for the FBI who according to the Government had observed the respondent over a considerable period of time and had adequate opportunity to testify to anything that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="6815.485" offset="27365334">The fair inference to draw from the lack of any testimony is that there was no test -- there was no activity to testify to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6823.270" offset="27396472">And I submit that where the Government has an opportunity to present testimony of “meaningful association,” has witnesses who would have knowledge or that if there were and presents no such testimony, it is certainly as fair an inference to conclude there was no “meaningful association” rather than to say that the Government had to prove it.</text>

            <text syncTime="6864.306" offset="27560626">There's been much discussion here that Rowoldt joined the Communist Party merely to get something to eat.</text>
            <text syncTime="6871.331" offset="27588733">I wanted to indicate and I want to read now from the opinion in Rowoldt, in which Rowoldt, the Court says, Rowoldt then explains his reasons for joining the Communist Party, “the purpose was probably this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6885.327" offset="27644635">It seemed to me that he came hand in hand, the Communist Party and the fight for bread.</text>
            <text syncTime="6891.362" offset="27668773">It seemed to me like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6892.711" offset="27674206">Let's put it this way that the Communist Party and the workers' alliance had one aim to get something to eat for the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="6900.349" offset="27704717">I didn't know it was against the law for aliens to join the Communist Party and the workers' alliance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6905.059" offset="27723630">Now, it's perfectly clear that Rowoldt was not joining the Communist Party to get a hand out.</text>
            <text syncTime="6910.433" offset="27745155">He did not think it was a salvation army.</text>
            <text syncTime="6912.808" offset="27754559">He joined it as an organization which he thought would help get people food generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="6917.971" offset="27775248">It was not personally to get food.</text>
            <text syncTime="6920.079" offset="27783711">Now, I just want to make that point clear.</text>
