            <text syncTime="16.689" offset="170088">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.023" offset="191509">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.493" offset="225364">The case involves principally the question of whether a state may arrest and convict petitioners of trespass where they sat at a white lunch counter in a business open to the general public and where a city ordinance required the policy of excluding Negroes to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.799" offset="310523">But the City of Greenville, South Carolina has an ordinance which is codified as Section 31-8 of the Code of the City of Greenville and which is reproduced in our brief at pages 2 and 3 and is in the record at page 49 which provides that any person -- it shall be unlawful for any person owning, managing or controlling any hotel, restaurant, caf√©, eating house, boarding house, or similar establishment to furnish meals to white persons and colored persons in the same room, at the same table, or at the same counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.699" offset="534131">And providing, however, that meals may be served to white persons and colored persons in the same room where separate facilities are furnished.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.331" offset="572688">The ordinance then proceeds to describe the manner in which the facility shall be made separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.585" offset="609677">S.H. Kress and Company is a large nationwide chain and it has a store in Greenville, South Carolina which caters to the general public including Negroes and the sale of more than 10,000 items.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.944" offset="675192">However, Kress' as is -- in the case and other localities also has a food counter from which it excludes Negroes in obedience to local custom and in further obedience to the ordinance to which we have just referred.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.227" offset="804237">It's not a separately enclosed restaurant, it's a lunch counter which has about 59 stools or seats placed adjacent to the counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.720" offset="858258">Now, the custom to which I have just referred will be discussed later in this presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.059" offset="883649">On August 9, 1960, about 14 young Negro citizens went into a Kress store in Greenville, South Carolina and seated themselves at the lunch counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.504" offset="945403">They seated themselves there and very shortly thereafter, Captain Bramlett of the Greenville City Police Department received a call by way of the radio at his police headquarters that there was -- there were some young colored boys and girls seated at the lunch counter around the Kress'.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.186" offset="1048116">This was the message that he received and according to the -- to his testimony, it was upon this -- receipt of this information that he and other officers proceeded to the Kress premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.495" offset="1113318">When he arrived at the Kress premises, he and the officer who rode with him met some other officers on the outside of Kress' and together, they went into the rear door and they found the young colored boys and girls seated at the lunch counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.770" offset="1194402">The lunch counter here is situated just inside the rear door and of course, as soon as they entered the store, they saw the young Negroes seated at -- sitting at the counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.216" offset="1256260">Now, there was Captain Bramlett and another patrolman from his office and when they arrived there, they found Officer Ohilia (ph) of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Agency also present and a number of other officers were in and about the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.915" offset="1335045">Officer Ohilia (ph), a member of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Agency later testified that he works directly under Chief Strom of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division who likewise or who also works under Governor Hollings, the Governor of the State is the Chief Officer then of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.708" offset="1450193">And the testimony is that the presence of Officer Ohilia (ph) on these premises was for the purpose of giving assistance to the local police.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.245" offset="1488332">But he also testified that his presence in any situation more or less reflected the attitude of the officer or the governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.341" offset="1536711">These young people were told later that the lunch counter was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.949" offset="1571192">As a matter of fact, Captain Bramlett of the Police Department testified that shortly after his arrival, he heard Manager G.W. West, the manager, the local manager of Kress' state to everyone that the lunch counter is closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.063" offset="1655620">That Manager West then turned the lights out over the lunch counter and that thereafter when the young Negroes refused to leave, he, Captain Bramlett announced to all of them that they were under arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="477.801" offset="2014542">They remained seated and that of course only the Negro petitioners were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.697" offset="2038157">Four of the young people who were arrested were under the age of 16 and their cases were referred to the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Greenville County.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.437" offset="2085073">The persons who were tried in the Municipal Court of the City of Greenville were found guilty of trespass and were given sentences of $100 or 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.239" offset="2148289">Their convictions were later upheld by the South Carolina Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1258.434" offset="5137115">Before getting into the legal issues, there's just one part of the factual statement by Mr. Perry that I would like to mention and that is the remarks he made concerning some of the testimony that it was testified by the store manager that prior to the time of the arrest, all of the white customers departed as a result of his request for everybody to leave the lunch counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.920" offset="5251009">One of the defense witnesses testified to the contrary that all of the white customers did not leave as a result of the manager's request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.654" offset="5293955">That presented squarely to the court below, to the trial court and to the -- a question of facts to be decided in the case and it is to be decided by the trial court on those facts that the white people did leave at the request of the manager.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.388" offset="5372949">Now, that holding by the trial court, we submit, is conclusive upon this Court because it is amply supported by the facts in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.875" offset="5414849">Now, getting into the legal issues, there seemed to me to be perhaps three basic issues in this entire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.874" offset="5454869">The first thing you have to get to when you discuss these cases at all is the question of not whether a person who runs a restaurant or any other kind of store has a right in the first analysis to choose the people with whom he would do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.894" offset="5518921">If he has no such right, then the whole thing is ended right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.299" offset="5536580">You have to resolve that issue first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.287" offset="5548492">Now, let's look at the case here and see whether or not this retail store who, as a restaurant there, does have that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.582" offset="5585690">You have to go back to decide that first of all to the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.951" offset="5603140">And you will find when you go back that there is no statute in the case which discussed this, so you have to rely on the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.765" offset="5638457">You'll see what the rights of restaurant owners have been in the times has placed and you will find, when you examine that that shopkeepers and people who did business with the public in general had a right under the common law to choose, to select those people with whom they would do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.010" offset="5715362">And they have that as an absolute right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.191" offset="5728110">Now, that rule was not without exceptions and we have to admit that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.178" offset="5744097">The first exception and probably the most important exception as the case of innkeepers and you have to look at the facts or the rules, see why it was that innkeepers would treat it different and the facts that for the different treatment of innkeepers bring out the facts of life as they existed in England at time those rules grew up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.022" offset="5835421">And they showed that as far as the innkeepers were concerned, that was tied in with travel in those times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.781" offset="5862484">And that was the time when the roads were very poor, when travel was slow either by horseback or coach and you couldn't make much time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.851" offset="5898742">There was also a time when law enforcement was not as good as it is now, and there were a lot of robbers in highways and we read about it in the novels at that time, who were prevalent on the highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.473" offset="5949315">So, that a traveler travelling alone had to have some sort of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.500" offset="5969377">He had to have a place to rest his horses or his means of conveyance, get feed for them, and he also had to find a place to obtain provision for himself and the place of safety and comfort overnight during the time when it was hardly possible to travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.521" offset="6037504">So that made the reason for the distinction of innkeepers in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.466" offset="6061223">Now, the second class of things that grew up along with the (Voice Overlap) --</text>

            <text syncTime="2154.580" offset="8721742">And under our law, under the trespass situation, if you didn't go to a -- if you didn't first used the law, he would have the right under the decision in our cases to protect his own private property by ejecting trespassers who would be people who would refuse to leave his property when he asked them to and wouldn't obey his orders, he would have the right under our law and I think properly under most state law that to use whatever force was necessary to reject such person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.825" offset="8854653">Now, the law does a favor to people taking the force of law into their own hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.619" offset="8881821">The troubles that would arise if a man, a store owner or anybody took it upon himself to throw out, people who refuse to obey his order to leave, would be a multitude of problems, you're going to have not only mild resistance, you're going to have cases where people resist with a great deal of force and it can lead to not only broken bones but deaths, and that's something that nobody wants to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.564" offset="8993625">That is a case -- in that case, where a landowner or property owner or a storeowner should be permitted to resort to the law with the force that could be administered impartially and with an even hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.612" offset="9049840">Not something where he is in there fighting and strangling and using force in a prejudiced manner where his personal interest are so involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.305" offset="9088606">He needs somebody from the outside that is not personally bound up in the use of that force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.584" offset="9133746">If you don't do that, you're going to have a question of whether or not a man can use his own force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.537" offset="9169481">You're going to come to the situation, for example, if it was to be held that a man could not resort to a statute like this, to eject anybody that he doesn't like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.582" offset="9233742">He's going to come to a situation where everybody is going to have to take the law under their own hands and you're going to have to hold that by virtue of enacting the law is the -- is this city ordinance requiring segregation, you're going to actually by letting a city enact an unconstitutional law, deprive a landowner of the right that he otherwise would've had under state law which permitted him to use state force to protect his property rights and eject trespassers.</text>
