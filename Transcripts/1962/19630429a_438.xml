            <text syncTime="28.641" offset="217945">Mr. Justice Harlan asked Mr. Friedman on Friday whether it was the government’s contention that the Trial Court did not realize that an agreement could be implied from the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.821" offset="298611">Mr. Friedman answered that that seemed to be the tone of the opinion and I think even affirmatively said, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.051" offset="327555">But after another question, he corrected that and he stated that the Trial Court had found that there was no express agreement and that there was no implied agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.697" offset="378128">The government accepts these findings and there is therefore no contention from the government in this case that the Trial Court overlooked the possibility of inferring an agreement from the facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.248" offset="936312">It was therefore in the position in which a machine which it had itself invented, developed was producing and selling could be excluded by Gegauf from the United States market.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.886" offset="1570879">Immediately or say in 1947, the Japanese imported no sewing machines into this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.987" offset="1611316">And before the war, they had imported none, one year one machine another year one machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.561" offset="1633573">But few imports they had, had been to countries adjacent to Japan, they were imports into those countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.981" offset="1667323">They started with none in 1947 and by 1959; they were importing 1,100,000 machines per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.791" offset="1726568">The affect of that was utterly disastrous to the sewing machine manufacturing industry in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.726" offset="1762304">When it started, there were seven manufacturers in addition to Singer.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.778" offset="1786441">When 1959 arrived, there was not one single manufacture of sewing machines left in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.030" offset="1819460">Singer alone survived with one minor exception of a company that manufactures for a particular company on specifications, but does not manufacture to sell Gegauf.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.745" offset="1866376">With that exception, every single manufacturer had been put out of business by this competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.339" offset="1904724">Now I think that the purchase of this patent must be viewed in that light.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.666" offset="1934085">Singer survived it, but it survived it solely because it was so well established, so big and had such resources that it could survive this delegate.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.839" offset="1982777">It's percentage of the market went down from -- by competing -- I'll get to the exact figures here, if I may, just one minute from -- they went down from 57% to around 30%.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.378" offset="2112867">Their manufacturing of machines, their portion of the market also went down the same way in the manufacturing in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.220" offset="2144214">They resorted to bringing in machines from abroad to a very large extent, bringing in as many as 193,000 in one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.332" offset="2180681">Now it has survived that and it has come back to a certain degree, but not to what it was and as of the last year, the Japanese had over 60% of the sewing machine market in the United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur E. Pettit</label>
            <text syncTime="620.926" offset="2587042">Well, he referred to a communication from Gegauf saying that Gegauf had not disclosed that Singer was proceeding on Singer's then owned patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.916" offset="2647019">He did not point out that that information came to Gegauf from a letter that Gegauf had received from Singer.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.442" offset="2677112">So Gegauf was merely saying that he had not disclosed to certain people in Germany that Singer had brought these actions on these patents and in doing it, he referred to your patent and ours, but by that purely colloquial he meant the patent that used to be ours and the information that these actions, that this action when brought came to him by a letter from Singer.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.914" offset="2778990">So there is no statement there that he knew these actions were going to be brought, but I think that's immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.230" offset="2812322">I don't think there is any question whatever that he knew that Singer was going to enforce the patent when it got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.903" offset="2834996">Now, Singer had said to Gegauf that the reason Singer wanted the patent was that Singer could enforce it better than Gegauf could.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.269" offset="2876479">Singer was paying Gegauf $90,000 for the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.380" offset="2892884">Singer was manufacturing a machine that was under it and there were infringers coming in.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.655" offset="2913991">Now, it's no secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.474" offset="2921305">I think the man who just has normal intelligence could not help but note that Singer was going to enforce the patent [Inaudible], he would otherwise would not be paying $90,000 to get it, its just simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.471" offset="2969266">And I say that that is the fact that anyone would have known and that Gegauf did know and that there is absolutely nothing wrong in the discussions that took place that merely recognized what the fact of the life were, of course it was going to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.352" offset="3040737">But it is crystal clear that Singer was protecting itself at every minute from getting into any entanglement with Gegauf and any kind of an agreement express, implied or otherwise that Singer would operate with these patents in a particular way.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.168" offset="3116074">Singer wanted to get the patents in order to be the complete owner of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.905" offset="3134986">The correspondence will show that time-after-time it referred to the fact that it wanted become the complete owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.368" offset="3156825">At one point, it was pointed out that the advantage of making a purchase and paying it and not paying all these works that they would be true with Gegauf.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.029" offset="3191515">Now the Trial Court has gone through all of those and has found that they are clear and you remember my saying the other day that he said, absolutely, there was no agreement, no understanding of any nature whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="813.137" offset="3355878">Well, I would say that the basic agreement was not for one you just mentioned it was the license agreement itself and that is another point that the Trial Court has made a finding on.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.178" offset="3396106">It made the finding that the purpose of the license -- of the cross-license agreement which of course came first, that the purpose of the cross-license agreement was to obtain a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.203" offset="3444172">That was the essence of it, that's what the party's consider was important.</text>

            <label>Mr. Arthur E. Pettit</label>
            <text syncTime="848.156" offset="3495999">There are two agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.213" offset="3508224">In the cross -- in the first agreement was of April 16 1956, in which the cross-license agreement was entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.173" offset="3540093">In that agreement there was the clause that was designed to be the normal non-litigating clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.657" offset="3566007">It said we will not litigate with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.014" offset="3579382">They have tried to construe that into a sinister provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.250" offset="3596413">There was nothing sinister whatever about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.268" offset="3604459">It was merely intended to put in the usual provisions for not litigating, when they had settled their litigation or prospective litigation by entering into the cross-license agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.010" offset="3655450">As you pointed out the other day Mr. Justice Goldberg, there is a provision in there that this is to be done in accordance with the laws and regulations of the State involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.309" offset="3688573">Now that is briefed and quite completely on several different points in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.875" offset="3726921">The government itself concedes that there was nothing improper with the cross-license agreement and it only picks up this clause to say that that isolated in standing alone is itself an illegal agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.750" offset="3786376">In connection with that I'd like to point out that the government's argument before the Trial Court was that the first sentence of that clause was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.559" offset="3833605">That was the sentence that provided that neither party would do anything to restrict the scope of the claim of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.789" offset="3866520">Now, they overlooked the fact that in various European countries there are proceedings, special types of proceedings that are known as proceedings to restrict the scope of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.303" offset="3920541">It is quite clear that that provision was intended to take care of that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.580" offset="3945723">The man who drafted this provision, he didn't draft it, but who put it into final shape was Stanford, who had prepared similar agreements with, had prepared similar agreements with Vigorelli, who subsequently prepared another agreement with Masonite.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.107" offset="4011760">He found in the draft that was submitted by Gegauf, a provision that would have stopped any interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.112" offset="4039868">Now he deliberately redrafted that and divided them into two sections with the concept that he was getting exactly the same result with this provision as he was getting with the Vigorelli agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.375" offset="4092844">An agreement that Mr. Friedman and the Government has consistently said, is almost a model of perfection in making the reach of the agreement not to restrict, go to those countries that had that type of procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.661" offset="4158046">Now the Trial Court went into this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.373" offset="4164838">It heard the testimony of the people, yet held that that clause was intended to cover the foreign countries and not to apply to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.943" offset="4211127">In the course of making its argument before the Trial Court, it expressively told the Trial Court that that was the only provision in the cross-license agreement that it considered to be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.628" offset="4269850">It set it up, it quoted the sentence in quote, in the entire time of this discussion we cannot find one single instance in which the Government even set forth in full the second sentence of this clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1088.292" offset="4456573">The Government both in it's -- in the document submitted just before the trial and in another one the post trial brief just after this, as I say, expressly told the Court that that was the only provision that it being illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.333" offset="4528671">Now it raises before this Court for the first time the argument that the second sentence is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.047" offset="4563571">It seems rather strange system to me that the Court -- that before the Trial Court the Government can just frankly say that it doesn't conceive that there is anything illegal and then when it loses in the point that it is making, it comes before this Court and asks that the Trial Court to be reversed in the ground that it did not find the clause illegal, which it told the Trial Court it didn't contend as illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.336" offset="4664717">Furthermore, the clause is clearly not illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.743" offset="4690317">They never say that there is a clause that says that we will facilitate the allowance of claims as broad as possible, but this is in accordance with the laws of the country and patent office involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.677" offset="4738069">It couldn't be clear from the evidence that Singer was wanting a valid patent and not an illegally broad patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.862" offset="4774849">There certainly is no compulsion in the finding that -- compulsion to find that when a person says a patent is broad as possible he means one beyond the reach of the law and into the prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.776" offset="4826467">And more than one says to get to particular destination as soon as possible, he doesn't mean necessarily there is no compulsion to find that he means by violation of all the law without reference to anybody that stands there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.146" offset="4879966">Now when they ask, when they provide that they should get and support and facilitate and there's nothing but facilitate, claims as broad as possible, I think that without anything else, it would be construed as meaning within the limits of the law and within the permission of the prior art.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.975" offset="4955303">Otherwise, you are saying that they are flatly making an agreement to support illegal claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.530" offset="4977455">The evidence is quite clear that they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.979" offset="4995323">Stanford testified, Stanford wrote letters during the period in which he pointed out the necessity of getting a valid patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.850" offset="5030745">The government makes a strange argument in connection with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.369" offset="5044851">It seems to imply, but it doesn't say so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.728" offset="5054255">It has never once said that it construes this as requiring either company to support an illegal claim, yet it seems to imply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.341" offset="5096782">And at the same time, it argues that the reason they did that was that Singer wanted to fight this tremendous Japanese influx of sewing machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.021" offset="5139414">Now the last thing in the world the Singer would want would be an invalid patent in order to use it against the power as terrific as the Japanese exports.</text>

            <text syncTime="1334.587" offset="5441703">Now the background for that too is rather important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.621" offset="5453824">This machine and this mechanism was actually invented by Johnson, member of the experimental department of Singer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.471" offset="5489246">As is so often the case, inventions come from two, and three and four people at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.168" offset="5515995">It turned out that the patent the Singer had lost by nine days, otherwise it would have and had the patent on this machine itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.175" offset="5560090">Now in the meantime, this was to be its prime machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.625" offset="5577853">It had spent $9 million on it by 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.400" offset="5593004">In 1959, 45% of its entire sewing machine revenue came from this machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.697" offset="5622157">There is nothing unusual to buy the patent that someone else has just beaten them too from nine days that covers squarely the mechanism in that in order to protect that mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.033" offset="5671476">And I just cannot believe, I don't think I've ever heard it said that there was no predatory practice, it wasn't a question of trying to exclude competitors or try to exclude other kind of machines and the Court found, that's another finding that the government has faced with, the Trial Court found that Singer's sole interest was the protection of its ‘401' machine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1433.389" offset="5836884">Now, I would like to address myself for a moment to the government's claim that the evidence in this case is, was it expressed at clear overwhelming that there was joint action for a common purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.218" offset="5960286">Now I said when you look at the claims they are making, you'll find out that they have made everyone of them to the Trial Court and that the Trial Court has found against them in each instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.200" offset="6016188">I think first, just to illustrate this, a claim that is basic to the government's entire argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.626" offset="6053909">It is that Gegauf contributed a large sum through giving the excess value of its patent to Singer on the understanding that Singer would then enforce that patent and would thus cripple the Japanese, so that the Japanese couldn't compete in Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.939" offset="6147114">Now you will notice that the objective was not to protect Gegauf in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.830" offset="6174699">This had been and was the objective as expressed by the Government before the Trial Court that it was to protect and help Gegauf in the United States, but it ran into the situation that Gegauf sent into the United States just 1,600 machines in a year 1957; that he was a small company and expressed the philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.206" offset="6268217">He did not want to grow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.754" offset="6274382">He thought to pick up the small companies and got into difficulty by trying to always enlarge and enlarge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.083" offset="6295698">He had his tools, he had his equipment, they were fully employed, he didn't want to get bigger, and that's his prime interest was in Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.567" offset="6329657">That sort of blew up in the argument that there was a great motive and incentive for Gegauf to enter into conspiracy to get the benefit in the United States of selling additional machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.238" offset="6384306">Now the Government with that finding there, and I don't believe that one would be inclined to reverse it or say there was no evidence to -- substantial evidence to sustain it, and they realize that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.455" offset="6433207">They now make quite a different argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.234" offset="6444283">They now say that the objective was to cripple the whole sewing machine industry and Japan so that it couldn't compete in Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.771" offset="6490467">Now let's see, what this industry is and how it's going to cripple it and see if we think that the Trial Court had no substantial basis for disregarding that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.550" offset="6537592">As I have just said, Japanese sewing machine is second, third or fourth for ten consecutive years as the biggest exporters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.085" offset="6567685">All the machines, infringing machines set into the United States in the years 1957 and 1958 represented 1.8, 2.4 and 1.8 of the total exports of sewing machines in Japan throughout the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.584" offset="6673742">Furthermore, if – would have enforced the patent completely, that doesn't mean that even that percentage would have been lost or they have been crippled, because they can just as easily make non-infringing machines as they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.273" offset="6736436">In 1957 they didn't make a single non-infringing machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.772" offset="6750438">In 1958, over 8% of their imports of the multicam machines were non-infringing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.417" offset="6777083">In 1952, they were 59, they were 32%, and the number imported of non-infringing was 500% of the number that had been imported in the year before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.037" offset="6831522">There is no reason in the world why they can't manufacture non-infringing machines, they are on the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.375" offset="6852838">In fact the Japanese are manufacturing and importing as Mr. Friedman conceded on Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.258" offset="6884394">Therefore, we have the spectacle of Gegauf being inspired in the disagreement not to keep these particular machines going to Europe, that didn't help the Government and he was afraid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.770" offset="6934444">One of his objections to this agreement was that the machines imported in the United States might be sent to Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.563" offset="6961612">That has some velocity backup, but that wouldn't help the Government, because that's no motive for Gegauf to go into an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.336" offset="6988675">Gegauf would have been hurt by that, so the Government has to find something better than that and it finds that the motive was to injure or as it puts it cripple the sewing machine industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.982" offset="7039352">It says that Gegauf gave excess value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.204" offset="7060146">The excess value it says was a magnificent value of this patent over and above what Singer paid for out of $90,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.908" offset="7095045">What's its evidence of this value?</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.887" offset="7110928">His evidence is that Gegauf, when it first started suggested that they would like to have $1 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.412" offset="7137050">When they put the document and evidence and showed that, the Trial Court said, well, we think may be as New York Counsel suggested that you ask for million dollars and see what you could get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.662" offset="7178010">Well, it was not without pressure that we put in a letter later showing that, that is just almost exactly what happened, you can just see it from the latter complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.705" offset="7222209">Trial Court's reaction to that it didn't bother the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.256" offset="7232345">It decided that the Gegauf had said to Singer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.847" offset="7246764">When it was asking Singer $125,000 for the patent, well we can get many times $125,000 each year, Gegauf sells to patent to Singer in trying to get Singer's pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.107" offset="7307786">So, the government accepts Gegauf as its valuation expert and attributes this tremendous value to it, and so argues that Gegauf contributed a tremendous valuable patent far in excess of the $90,000 paid for it, in order to get Singer to enforce the patent, cripple the whole sewing machine industry in Japan, less than 1.8% of their exports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.660" offset="7421994">Now the government and the Trial Court dealt with that in its reference to probably the counsels have suggested it to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.609" offset="7461804">With reference to one additional item it maybe an express finding, that the fact that it sold a series.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.317" offset="7500675">In fact that in two years, the government pointed out in two years, Singer got a considerable amount of money out of this, almost twice, so just about twice what it paid for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.566" offset="7537664">The government -- the Trial Court dealt with this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.319" offset="7556681">It said the fact that in two years Singer received almost twice as much from Sears Roebuck licenses Gegauf collected from the sale of its patent to Singer, does not buttress the conclusion gone with the government, that Gegauf was willing to part with a valuable property right at a low price in exchange for action for by Singer against their common competitors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1927.077" offset="7811636">Sears Roebuck was the only licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.557" offset="7825638">There was, call your attention to one point, I would mention later if I get to it and I doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.588" offset="7849775">There was a right in Gegauf to permit one company in Japan to shift machines into the United States, in Germany to ship machines to Pfaff, to ship machines into the United States, he never gave that right, nothing is ever done about it except to eliminate it from the contract at a later date, that is one of the -- another one of the facts that the government relies upon and I'll refer to it in just one minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.578" offset="7985716">The government as another one of its facts that it wants this to Court to act upon, is that there were some kind of a -- I don't know what to call it, whether to call it a phantom agreement or some kind of an obligation, but they can see that there is no agreement express or implied and yet they say that Singer was so bound to Gegauf by some kind of an obligation that he couldn't possibly license Singer, couldn't license without getting Gegauf's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.513" offset="8145377">Now how they worked that out at the time that they concede that there was no agreement expressed or implied, and I don't know but they do, and they were very dramatic about it before the Trial Court and said to the Trial Court, Singer, talking about the double cross, he said, Singer couldn't pull a stunt like that and the Trial Court leaned over said, why couldn't it? They're in business to make an honest dollar, by honest legitimate means.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.821" offset="8266689">Therefore he ended completely their philosophy that there was any acquisition or any obligation whatever not to license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.598" offset="8305768">The Trial Court expressly found that there was no restraint whatever upon Singer's right to license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.969" offset="8343280">Now in another point, another place in the government's brief where it is riding on another point, it expressly states that there is no restraint upon the right of either to license and yet it stands before this Court when it's arguing on one point, it argues that there was a restrain on licensing which the Trial Court found just to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.027" offset="8447457">On the cross agreement this is another that they argue shows cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.556" offset="8489566">When Singer -- after Singer brought its Tariff Commission action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.183" offset="8508061">The Tariff Commission asked whether there were any licenses and Singer explained the Sears Roebuck license and why it had given it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.427" offset="8545050">And I might say incidentally that the reason for that is the Tariff Commission doesn't like to ask -- act as just an enforcement agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.751" offset="8578382">If you're going to license your patent well go ahead and do it, but if you're going to protect yourself and be -- and protect an industry and that what's you say when you go before your Tariff Commission, that you were there to protect an industry from unfair competition and one of the methods of unfair competition is to use your patents, infringing -- your patents and then sell infringing patents to the products – suggestion to the competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.099" offset="8667721">The government -- the Tariff Commission asked this question, Singer explained the circumstances under which it had granted the license to Sears Roebuck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.115" offset="8707845">They ask whether there was -- whether Pfaff had a license because the facts the agreements where there to show this arrangement with Gegauf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.747" offset="8738356">Singer said that it did not, but after all Singer couldn't be the final word on that because Gegauf was the final one and although it hadn't been permitted yesterday, it could be permitted today or tomorrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.914" offset="8791019">It wrote Gegauf a letter asking Gegauf if he would eliminate the provision about Pfaff from the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.844" offset="8830725">The government first uses Singer's -- the finding about Singer's motive in doing that was to help it in the Tariff Commission proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.227" offset="8872312">It converts that into a finding that that's the reason Gegauf ultimately did it, but I just point out the finding was that, that was Singer' s motive in write off, not that it was Gegauf's motive in agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.415" offset="8925080">Gegauf ultimately agreed, but through exercise first of a bludgeoning power over Singer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.962" offset="8959248">And the license agreement then entered into between them, Gegauf suggested that the provision be put in that they would disclose on execution of the agreement any previous licenses or arrangement that had been made with respect to the patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.369" offset="9028838">This was Gegauf's idea. Gegauf had outstanding a license to Phoenix in Germany.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.656" offset="9061961">He didn't disclose it to Singer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.815" offset="9074604">He didn't disclose it when Singer purchased the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.685" offset="9090069">It was a very broad license applying to any of the rights, any of these patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.192" offset="9116191">There was an argument that Gegauf made and possible to sustain it depending upon the intention of the parties, that it applied only to Germany but if you read the wording you wouldn't think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.070" offset="9167600">So finding himself in a position where Singer now needed something from him, he took advantage of it to compel Singer to indemnify him from any liability that he might have incurred by selling this patent to the Singer and bear in mind he sold it without telling Singer about this outstanding license.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.637" offset="9261955">He then demanded that Singer give him indemnification from any liability whatever to Phoenix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.143" offset="9299989">Singer obviously was annoyed, but it had no choice and it entered into an indemnification agreement that was protected from any claim against Phoenix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.999" offset="9343352">Now when you see all these backgrounds that doesn't -- this background, it doesn't show this willing [Inaudible] standing by waiting to jump in and help Singer, when he did it, he did it on his own terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.421" offset="9401031">And the Trial Court considered this whole affair, it's written its opinion about it and it's what it finds, is further evidence that the arms length dealing which it characterized all Singer's dealings with Gegauf.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.099" offset="9463724">Now here is again a very contrast between what the Court finds and what the government is now urging this Court to go into and find just the reverse, and it has just item after item, in which that kind of a thing is asked to this Court, and when you look at them, you not only will prove I believe that there is no basis for saying there is no substantial evidence supporting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.478" offset="9569259">I don't see how the conclusion could be other than what the Trial Court found itself, even if the decision was to be de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.733" offset="9610324">The government on the law point argues that there is a joint effort, joint purpose and it uses mostly the parallelism cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.237" offset="9672286">But I want to point out that there is no question of any parallel action here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.132" offset="9695901">Gegauf first owned this application and when it owned it, it was free to do with it whatever it wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.231" offset="9720247">There was no economic power forcing Gegauf, there were no economic power Gegauf enforcing Singer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.212" offset="9744175">When Singer acquired the patent, it was free to what it wanted to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.274" offset="9760475">This is not a question of competing patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.283" offset="9772492">It's a question of competing applicants for the same patent and with the winner being willing to sell that patent to Singer, because Singer wanted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.707" offset="9814183">Now they make great store over the fact that Gegauf anticipated that it would be enforced and they say that he didn't need an agreement, of course, he would enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.117" offset="9863816">So you're just as bad whether you have an agreement or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.765" offset="9874474">If you buy a product that can be used only for one purpose and you hope it will be used for that purpose that becomes joint action for a common purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.618" offset="9913866">Now I think that the Parke, Davis case pretty clearly shows although the express finding wasn't on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.241" offset="9940302">It shows that if there is anything in the world that's left now, it is the right of a man to hope, if all he does is hope that people will maintain prices and he does nothing what else, but to state his price and then takes no other step, but hope that they will do it, he is not violating the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.569" offset="10029641">It takes some kind of an action to tackle that before there is any violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.893" offset="10054928">And I think that applies here, and that's in price maintenance, which is a far more touchy situation and an unreasonable or reasonable restraint with the acquisition of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.761" offset="10094425">There is no economic power here of either of these parties over the other and I think the Government is faced with the fact that if it's dealing with a conspiracy as distinguished from combination, there is no agreement of any kind express or implied and I think that ends the conspiracy portion of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.071" offset="10187630">If it is dealing with a combination as distinguished from the conspiracy, I think that in every combination case you will find that there is some element of a power of coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.410" offset="10241024">You will find two or more people having some power, economic or otherwise, which permits them without any justification or any right other than their own power to cause other people to act in a desired method, such as taking away the merchandise from them or other controls that you might have owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.940" offset="10327124">There is no suggestion even of an economic power of Gegauf over Singer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.630" offset="10353873">Singer had made no agreements, no power; Singer is free to do what it wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.142" offset="10379891">I cannot see that a mere hope or expectation even if it existed would count as a violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.702" offset="10414164">And the fact is that the Trial Court has found that Gegauf had no interest in the United States market, so even the concept of a hope or an expectation is entirely beside the point and it is not correct and the Court has found against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.660" offset="10474036">It found expressly that Gegauf's interest was in Europe and was not in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3112.801" offset="12554533">Now after that, came the acquisition of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.176" offset="12572087">Finally I would like to just -- two minutes I may have, if that's what it is, I would like to point out that the Trial Court also went into the market and found that this machine competes not only with multiple cam machines, but it competes with all kinds of machines, replacing cam machines, manually operated machines, straight stitch with the zigzag attachments on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.531" offset="12681488">There is nothing unreasonable in restraint of this, if in all other respects, the enforcement of this patent was felt someway subject to restraint, which I think it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.833" offset="12738748">Still the market here is such a small portion of the market in which it competes that I think if you would even find a relevant market basis that there is nothing wrong in this small portion of market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.262" offset="12800397">It's in the testimony compared to all the machines, and finally, bear in mind that this whole machine is a sewing machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.532" offset="12829550">This should not be conceived off as a zigzag sewing machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.980" offset="12843342">This machine is used and testimony shows that 90% for sewing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.113" offset="12855777">It would like saying that an automobile with a heater was for the purpose of getting warm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.605" offset="12873749">Now the machine is to sew it and straight stitch and 90% of all the sewing is done on this machine is straight stitch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.441" offset="12917112">The pattern companies do not even issue patterns with the zigzag designs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.931" offset="12935084">I mean all the patterns companies, if you go to pattern companies you get patterns for dresses they are all straight stitch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.457" offset="12957236">This is a -- this is just a little pricing thing, that is at sales point, a good sales point, but it doesn't convert it from a sewing machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.463" offset="12993181">It's still fundamentally and entirety a sewing machine and it's used for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.319" offset="13012616">It's insignificant in the making of dresses by the way.</text>

            <text syncTime="3261.864" offset="13150856">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.869" offset="13162872">In my brief rebuttal time, I just like to refer to two items.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.448" offset="13177187">The first is the question raised by Mr. Justice White in his colloquy with Mr. Pettit with respect to precisely what Singer's position was in connection with the acquisition of the Gegauf patent and the power to enforce this patent against infringing machines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.260" offset="13252420">The machine which Singer invented and was developing its 401 machine which had been of the stand before the recess, was a machine which had a stack of cams and two followers capable of combining intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.114" offset="13315845">That was the invention covered by the Johnson Patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.797" offset="13334549">The Gegauf patent was a more basic invention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.305" offset="13344580">It covered the concept of a stack of cams and a single follower.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.319" offset="13364642">Now Singer, once it got the Johnson Patent of course, could have enforced that Patent against all machines which infringed the machine it had invented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.511" offset="13421380">When Singer says it had to acquire the Johnson -- the Gegauf patent, in order to protect its invention, I think what it really means is it had to acquire another patent because machines which it could not exclude under its patent was so similar and it felt was so competitive with its machine that it was necessary for it to get this additional patent, not because it needed it to protect infringes of its machine, but to protect itself against the infringes who infringe the competing machine.</text>
