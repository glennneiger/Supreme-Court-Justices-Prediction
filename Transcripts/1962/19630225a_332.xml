            <text syncTime="13.679" offset="158072">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.862" offset="178866">The question presented in this case is whether the Secretary of the Interior has authority under Section 31 of the Mineral Leasing Act to cancel oil and gas leases by administrative action for failure to comply with the Department's regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.170" offset="264025">The facts are uncontroverted in this case and briefly stated, they are as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="48.231" offset="296312">On September 11, 1956, petitioner's father, N.W.C. Boesche, now deceased, filed application for an oil and gas lease on an 80-tract -- 80-acre tract of public land.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.824" offset="374680">On that date an adjoining 40-acre tract was already under application for lease, previously filed by one Thomas Connell.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.934" offset="419088">Also on September 11, 1856, but later in the day, Vincent Cuccia and George E. Conley filed a joint application for a lease on both the 40-acre tract previously filed by Connell and the 80-acre tract previously filed by Boesche.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.278" offset="500485">Subsequently, the manager of the Santa Fe Land Office on December 1, 1956 issued a lease to the 40-acre parcel to Connell.One year later, on December 1, 1957, the manager, after making a determination that Boesche, petitioner herein, was the first qualified applicant for the 80-acre tract, issued a lease to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.595" offset="637785">And later on January 24, 1958, the manager rejected the Cuccia and Conley application for a lease on the 80 acres already issued to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.081" offset="695672">Cuccia and Conley then appealed to the Director of the Bureau of Land Management.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.906" offset="723048">And on January 9, 1959, one year and one month after the lease had been issued to the petitioner, the Director held that petitioner's lease should be cancelled for a failure to comply with the Department's 640-acre rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.965" offset="811238">Boesche, the petitioner, then appealed to the Secretary of the Interior and on August 5, 1959, the Secretary, through his Deputy Solicitor, affirmed the Director's decision and directed cancellation of the Boesche lease.</text>

            <text syncTime="212.109" offset="951777">Whatever development there could be has been halted by the Secretary's administrative cancellation or rather attempted administrative cancellation of the lease because as soon as the Secretary hands down his decision, our client moved to the District Court in an action to prevent the Secretary to cancel.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.255" offset="1080404">During this entire period, because of the so-called, “appellate review,” of the Department, knowing full well that there was a review procedure and the fact that the conflicting applicant, Cuccia and Conley had filed an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.407" offset="1156995">My client was unable to do anything with the lease during this period, although he supposedly had a lease for a five-year term, and so long thereafter, this oil and gas was produced.</text>

            <text syncTime="286.304" offset="1248632">Not quite, Your Honor, in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.059" offset="1263574">At least the lessor would not have been immediately involved in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.406" offset="1284995">In effect, there is a double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.379" offset="1296906">There is the appellate review jeopardy in the administrative procedure and then of course there would be one in a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.636" offset="1341942">But during all this period, since the Secretary of the Interior issues a lease and upon issuance of the lease, the primary term for five-year commences, you have a double period where the lessee can do nothing with the lease, although he has been given under the lease and under the statute the exclusive right to go on the land, to produce and develop.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.508" offset="1489377">Do you get that -- supposing you're wrong in this case, do you get that back?</text>

            <text syncTime="351.640" offset="1509961">If we're wrong in the case, I think we do get the rent back.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.409" offset="1525008">But let me say this, the Secretary has pointed out in his brief that perhaps it might be better not to issue a lease until the conflicting applications right of review has been -- has gone through the administrative procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.080" offset="1599718">But then he goes on to say, while we wait the relevant considerations and now we've decided we'll issue the lease first and then take up the appellate procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.942" offset="1639111">But if my client's lease had been sustained, Your Honor, in answer to your question, he would have lost one year, eight months, and five days of his lease period.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.680" offset="1698043">And during that entire time, he would have had to pay the rental and the rental would not have been turned in.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.720" offset="1730226">And actually as we pointed out in our reply brief, the reason why -- and the Secretary delicately refrains from stating the real reason, the real reason why they issued the leases first and then take up the appellate procedure, is so that they can collect the rent as soon as the lease is issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.865" offset="1810787">But the Secretary points out in justification of that that really, you know, in most cases the lease is sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.211" offset="1840253">But then in most cases, mind you, and even if my client's lease had been sustained by the Secretary, during that period, the lease -- primary term of the lease would apply and he would have had to pay rental for a period in which he had no use whatever of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.146" offset="1919979">Now, Section 17 of the Act says that the lessee shall have a five-year term.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.744" offset="1946311">It says nothing about a three-year term or a three-and-a-half-year term or a three years, eight months term.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.418" offset="1981001">But in effect, this is what the Secretary has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.034" offset="1991555">It says he collects the lease rental and the term begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.933" offset="2007124">And every instance where the lease is sustained, the lessee's lease is curtailed, whether it would be for a year, a year-and-a-half or two years.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.641" offset="2101896">But we do object -- we do object issuing a lease and then telling the man, “We'll take your rental but we're not going to permit you to go on the land to develop that lease.”</text>
            <text syncTime="511.345" offset="2148707">And I might say, Your Honor, Your Honors, in this connection, I have the lease here.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.417" offset="2169083">I think it's very interesting because item six of the lease issued to Boesche says, “Offeror's signature to this office shall also constitute offeror's signature to an acceptance of this lease.”</text>
            <text syncTime="533.388" offset="2236897">The offeror further agrees that this offer cannot be withdrawn in whole or in part unless the withdrawal is received by the land office before this lease has been signed in behalf of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.624" offset="2313906">They tell a man, “Once you sign the lease and one -- once the Government has signed the lease, you can't withdraw it,” this is a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.098" offset="2355806">But this doesn't prevent the Government from immediately moving to cancel a lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.541" offset="2377540">In other words, it's a unilateral proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.396" offset="2393004">The Government is bound by one set of rules and petitioner is bound by another set of rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.145" offset="2415992">And I submit that this is contrary to our entire Anglo-Saxon concept of contractual relations and this, this Court has long held in the Sinking-Fund cases that with respect to contractual matters, the Government is as much bound by contracts as individuals.</text>

            <text syncTime="636.766" offset="2650467">Yes, and if I may proceed in this connection, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.142" offset="2667917">It is petitioner's contention that Section 31, that under Section 31, the Secretary of the Interior has no authority to cancel a lease administratively and I think here it might be well to read what the section says.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.376" offset="2720893">The text of Section 31 has originally enacted in February 25, 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.756" offset="2742418">It provides acceptance to hear as otherwise herein provided any lease issued under the provisions of this Act may be forfeited and cancelled by an appropriate proceeding in the United States District Court for the district in which the property or some thought thereof is located whenever the lessee fails to comply with any of the provisions of this Act or the lease, or the general regulations promul -- promulgated under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.248" offset="2872404">Now, thus in its original form, Section 31 expressly provides that judicial proceedings shall govern the cancellation of leases for any violation of the departmental regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.980" offset="2935306">And this was the understanding of the Secretary himself in 1930, for in 1930 in the case of Melish Consolidated Placer Oil Mining Company versus Testerman, the Secretary said in no uncertain terms quotes, “The lease once granted was beyond recall by the Secretary and is only subject to cancellation in the federal courts,” and he cites Section 31 of the Act of February 25, 1920.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.663" offset="3057977">But I want to go on to say that in 1935, the Congress did give the Secretary of the Interior expressed authority to cancel leases upon the failure of lessee to comply with any of the provisions of this lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.773" offset="3122448">And again, in 1946, the same provision was added to Section 31 at the end thereof and reads as follows: "Any lease issued after August 21, 1935, under the provisions of Section 17 of the Act shall be subject to cancellation by the Secretary of the Interior after 30 days notice upon the failure of the lessee to comply with any of the provisions of the lease unless or until the land covered by any such lease is known to contain valuable deposits of oil or gas."</text>
            <text syncTime="790.375" offset="3264867">There was no violation by petitioner of any of the lease provisions and this is the only basis upon which the Secretary can cancel a lease under the provisions of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.115" offset="3315858">Now, in his brief, the Secretary of the Interior asserts that he has the administrative power to cancel a lease independently of the Mineral Leasing Act and notwithstanding any of its expressed provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.498" offset="3369357">And the Secretary implies this authority from Section 441 of the revised statutes of 1875, in which the Secretary of the Interior is given the job of supervising the public business relating to the public lands including mines.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.095" offset="3459741">Now, the question before this Court comes therefore in this setting.Congress, by 1935 amendment of the Act and the later 1946 amendment of Section 31 of the Act expressly provided that the Secretary may administratively cancel leases where there has been a violation by the lessee of the terms of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.572" offset="3561618">Otherwise, Section 31 of the Act remains in its original form that the cancellation of an oil and gas lease is to be accomplished by judicial proceedings and not only just judicial proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.510" offset="3617416">Judicial proceedings in an action filed in the United States District Court where the land or any part thereof is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.160" offset="3652002">Thus, we have a situation that the Secretary has been given expressed powers with respect to the cancellation of leases but it is a limited one.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.555" offset="3689618">It is limited to a specific situation and that situation is where the lessee himself has violated the terms of the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.306" offset="3728593">And this means in effect that the lessee has violated the contract and therefore since the lessee himself has violated the contract, the Secretary of the Interior can move in and exercise his right to invalidate the contract since there has a violation by the lessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.305" offset="3804557">If the Secretary has the power to cancel a lease, apart from the provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act, the 1935 Amendment, the 1946 Amendment, the terms of Section 31 in its original form is totally superfluous.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.932" offset="3883133">It is rendered absolutely meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.267" offset="3896404">Moreover, we should know that Section 37 of the Act reads that the deposits of coal, phosphate, sodium, oil, oil shale, and gas shall be subject to disposition only in the form and manner provided in this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.617" offset="3973831">And yet the Secretary of the Interior notwithstanding this mandatory language of the Act seeks to invoke an authority totally apart from, outside of the scope of the Mineral Leasing Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1015.833" offset="4166719">This is not actually so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.038" offset="4175496">First of all, we have this Melish decision that I have cited, where in 1930 the Secretary stated very expressly in and in no uncertain terms we have no authority to administrative cancel -- administratively cancel the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.554" offset="4225546">And up to 1938, the only cancellation has been for a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.026" offset="4255431">But if we refer to Section 26 of the Mineral Leasing Act, we will see that under Section 26, the Secretary was given expressed authority to cancel permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.952" offset="4295137">So he can hardly claim his cancellation of permits up to 1938 as any of statutory authority for cancelling leases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1086.734" offset="4450304">But Congress intended to expressly provide for the administration of this Act and how these things could be cancelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.952" offset="4479143">And with respect to Section 26, they said the Secretary has authority to cancel permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.889" offset="4498892">Now, the earliest cancellation of a lease, if you will refer to the appendix is in 1938 and curiously enough it's the same person, Boesche.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.202" offset="4540165">Historically, this is the first cancellation by the Secretary of the Interior of a lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.064" offset="4563675">And curiously enough, it was not passed, it was canceled solely because the Secretary had no right and the Government had no title within the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.394" offset="4604949">And after that, the earliest cancellation was in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.001" offset="4623339">But I want to go on to say that the implication by the Secretary of implied authority to cancel leases by the Section 441 of the 1875 Revised Statutes cannot be sustained in view of this Court's holding in Youngstown versus Sawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.902" offset="4711006">In Youngstown versus Sawyer, this Court established the principle that although the executive may imply a general authority in cases where there had been no specific provisions set forth by the Congress with respect to proceedings to be -- to be followed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1616.111" offset="6567790">I don't think so, Your Honor, for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.772" offset="6582418">This matter was taken into account in Brown versus Hitchcock and in that case, the Supreme Court had before it the question of a patent that have been issued by the Department of the Interior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.427" offset="6641037">Under the law, patents were not supposed to be issue -- issued conveying mineral rights in the event that the land is known to be mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.567" offset="6693595">In this case, they couldn't quite make up their mind whether it was agricultural or mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.423" offset="6713031">So they wrote into patent that if it's agricultural, you have the patent -- you have the title but if it turns out to be mineral, you don't have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.726" offset="6766320">And this is what the Court said and I think it's applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.900" offset="6787009">It says that the only thing that the Secretary is authorized to do is to issue a patent and no uncertain patents are permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.820" offset="6838627">You make the determination before do you issue the patent as whether it's mineral or it's not mineral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.427" offset="6861093">And in this case, the manager made a determination that the lessee was the first qualified applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.356" offset="6888782">If you're not ready to make a determination and fulfill your executive function of making a determination prior to issuance of a lease or a patent, just don't issue the lease or patent until you make up your mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.253" offset="6948342">And there's nothing to prevent the Secretary of the Interior, especially since they know that there is a conflicting applicant, nothing to prevent him from deferring the issuance of the lease until the appellant procedure is followed through in the Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.666" offset="7006020">The only thing that's -- that the Government doesn't like about this it doesn't collect the money right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.342" offset="7028694">But I think it may be morally questionable to say to a man, “Look, we'll issue a lease but this is just tentative and all you have is a precarious type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.144" offset="7075924">But meanwhile you pay your rent.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.166" offset="7088044">Now, the Act says nothing about tentative leases, the Act says nothing about precarious leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.906" offset="7115003">The Act says under Section 17 that a lease shall be issued for a primary term of five years and so long they're after as oil and gas is produced in paying funds.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="2633.778" offset="10638503">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.200" offset="10652191">The issue in this case, as we see it, is a very simple but a very practical one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.342" offset="10680717">When a mistake is made by someone in a local land office in granting one of the thousands of applications for leases that come requiring almost monthly, a mistake that violates the Department's regulations and that defeats the prior right of another applicant, may the Secretary correct the mistake as soon as it's brought to his attention, refund the rental and give the lease to the person entitled thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.158" offset="10800044">Now, the court below held that he may, petitioner argues that he may not either, I'm not quite clear on this, either because there is no power at all to cancel a lease once issued which some of his argument had seem to lead to or because it must be done in judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.658" offset="10877994">In either event, we submit, that the Secretary has the administrative power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.722" offset="10902235">Because this is a question of great housekeeping or at management importance to the Interior Department, and because it has a very pragmatic argument, I would like to emphasize first the nature of the land office's business and the way these questions arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.382" offset="10980916">The management of the public domain involves thousands, literally thousands of repairing decisions taken almost daily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.446" offset="11013204">Upon claims, surveys, inquiries, applications of various arts requirements and also applications for leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.298" offset="11052596">The transactions have to be handled initially by one of the scattered local land offices around the county, who would keep the tract books, the serial registers and other records pertaining to the land and the various claims against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.725" offset="11106304">Under the -- under the statute including the Mineral Leasing Act, the Land Offices Act really as real estate managers, keeping charge of this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.287" offset="11148518">Under the Mineral Leasing Act, they process applications or issue leases, or approve or disapprove request for the assignment of leases and extensions of the term, they supervise their performance, the drilling and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.901" offset="11211003">On June 30, 1960 for example, there were 139,000 leases outstanding under the Mineral Leasing Act alone, not taking into account all the leases under Taylor Grazing Act, other mineral claims, homestead entries and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.329" offset="11284668">Only this two is only a part of the local land offices business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.677" offset="11314030">For example, one land office received 10,000 applications in a single month for leases under the Mineral Leasing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.996" offset="11351333">I think that is not a representative month but it does show the volume of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.898" offset="11374947">There were 50,000 leases issued in a three-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.766" offset="11402428">During six months recently, there were 6,000 leases issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.229" offset="11420296">So that you can see the volume of the transactions just under the Mineral Leasing Act which is part of the business that this local land offices carry on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.587" offset="11461674">Now, in the conduct of (Inaudible) applying in enterprise, some mistakes are bound to occur and the question arises, how are those mistakes to be corrected?</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.920" offset="11507022">Usually, by some superior officer to whose attention the facts are later brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.265" offset="11532413">The common sense answered given by both experience and history is that the Secretary of the Interior should have the power to correct the mistake by canceling the improper action in the local office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.518" offset="11585494">The power has been used to cancel improper mining clients, homestead entries, timber entries, improper survey, improper lieu land selections, improper leases under the Taylor Grazing Act and the improper leases under the Mineral Leasing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.003" offset="11659368">In the three-year period 1958, 1960, there were 1,100 administrative cancellations of leases under the Mineral Leasing Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2969.108" offset="11979839">There are quite in our view, quite clearly edited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.121" offset="11991855">You will recall that at common law, a lessor does not have the right to forfeit a lease for a breach of the covenants, the failure performance by the lessee.</text>

            <text syncTime="3845.698" offset="15486203">Now, of course, with these cases, the Secretary does, even if he'd go into court, he would have to take some preliminary step to determine when he would go to court and when he wouldn't go to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3858.302" offset="15536567">And it seems to me that all the arguments about the inconvenience of the lessee are just as serious where he goes to the court -- announces he is going to court, as they are where he announces and administered to cancellation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.011" offset="15591424">I might make it plain at this point what I hope to say earlier in claiming the power to cancel of course we do not claim that this is an untrammeled discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.034" offset="15635519">The Secretary is bound by his own rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.917" offset="15647013">There is also provision to a very considerable judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.414" offset="15664985">So that this is really, may he in the first instance, wipe out this mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.860" offset="15686823">Now, Justice Harlan, let me come to the second part of Section 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.875" offset="15714826">And there I think that I can deal with that and with the problem of history of the administrative interpretation about which the Chief Justice asked at the second time or at least it was on sequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3916.456" offset="15769161">As the Act was originally enacted in 1920, there were so far as oil lands are concerned, really two kinds of transactions in which private citizens were interested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3932.072" offset="15831646">One, was the lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.392" offset="15840946">The lease was used for lands -- primarily for lands that did have petroleum reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.492" offset="15869367">The other thing you might get would be an exploration permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.012" offset="15891414">A power to go on the land and explore and the reason that second paragraph of Section 31 was not in the original Act, Justice Harlan, it is because you didn't have the kind of noncompetitive lease before oil is discovered, at least not to the same extent but you did have asked in 1935.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.002" offset="15983365">You simply have the exploration permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.257" offset="15996426">Now, with respect to exploration permits, the original statute gave the Secretary power to cancel an exploration permit for failures with Section 26, for failure to exercise due diligence in the prospecting work in accordance with terms and conditions stated in the permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.575" offset="16097677">And the same question might have arisen then about Section 26 which has been raised now about the first paragraph of Section 31.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.399" offset="16132995">Is this exclusive?</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.252" offset="16140413">Does this mean that they say impliedly through a negative fragment that the Secretary may not cancel an oil prospecting permit for any other reason than for failure to exercise due diligence in prospecting work, not for fraud, not for mistake, etcetera?</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.525" offset="16209481">Well, the fact is that I come now to the administrative interpretation, that from 1920 until 1935 as long as prospective permits were issued, the Secretary did assert the power to cancel prospective permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.336" offset="16284714">I'm afraid in my brief I was guilty of that -- some of our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.649" offset="16301955">We equated permits and leases and during the 1920, 1935 period we should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4057.391" offset="16332988">But the permits were regularly cancelled during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.354" offset="16360782">There were during that same period, Mr. Chief Justice, a number of leases issued for where those lands where there was known to be oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="4073.709" offset="16398190">I'm making a rough division here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.764" offset="16406444">I don't pretend it's precisely accurate but it's substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.110" offset="16423790">There were a number of leases issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.875" offset="16434866">The best of my knowledge, the only -- the question of cancellation was mentioned in only one case, the Melish case for which my brother quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4094.648" offset="16481991">In fact, the Secretary determined in that case that there was in any event no cause for cancellation that was wronged and deterred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.779" offset="16530474">There is, as I read it, but my friends in the Department of Interior disagree, what I would call a dictum to the effect that there was no power to cancel an oil lease, which meant a lease that now corresponds to the lease after competitive bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.243" offset="16600377">But in any event, that's the only expression up to that time that I think we should acknowledge there is a dictum that certainly looks against this but it was a clear dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.299" offset="16640606">Also, I cannot claim that as to that time, the power to cancel leases was exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.725" offset="16662235">In 1935, provision was made to cancel, to do away with the system of exploration permits and it was at that time, Justice Harlan, that there was put into the statute, this second paragraph of Section 31 which was intended to give the Secretary a power with respect to none -- bad conduct in the future, if I may put it colloquially.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.393" offset="16800893">With respect to the noncompetitive leases are only a part of that leases where no oil and gas had been discovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.075" offset="16831718">Corresponding to his power to cancel a permit for failure to exercise due diligence was brought somehow but I think it was essentially the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.285" offset="16872469">It came in at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4194.524" offset="16881455">Now, we say that it is -- it seems to me really quite unthinkable that Congress by that second paragraph had any intention to deny the Secretary with respect to noncompetitive leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4213.118" offset="16955852">A power that he had been exercising with respect to their predecessor's exploration permits for roughly 15 years and the power that he had been exercising with respect to every other kind of interest of land still in the public domain, land not patented for at least a century.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.681" offset="17046131">To read that much negative fragment, it seems to me to go contrary to the whole history of our notion that the Department of Interior is the special tribunal for dealing with public lands where there are many rapid transactions in an administrative capacity.</text>

            <text syncTime="4305.694" offset="17326164">There's certainly nothing in the legislative history contrary to our interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.825" offset="17354689">Now, Mr. BenEzra cites in his brief, a little snippet from the legislative history, where Senator Lenroot said that the Secretary has a right or authority under the bill -- under the bill to cancel a lease and it's true, he did utter those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="4332.139" offset="17431907">But if you will go to the context in 58 Cong. Rec. 4168, you'll find that it really throws no light at all on this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4346.446" offset="17489168">Now, the colloquy arose because Senator Walsh of Massachusetts was concerned about two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.888" offset="17514872">In the first place, he wondered whether somebody shouldn't have authority to fix the price for oil and gas coming from Government leases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.119" offset="17543816">And in the second place, he was worried about what would happen when the Secretary exercised his power to cancel a lease for the reason stated in Section 31, in other words, for future nonperformance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.367" offset="17604838">And with respect to the second, he said, well, why shouldn't the Secretary -- may I ask the Senator -- addressing Senator Lenroot and Senator Smoot, state whether he has any objection to an amendment, giving the Government authority to operate a well where there's a lease in existence which the Secretary of Interior cancel it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.278" offset="17692505">Mr. Lenroot said, which he has can -- which he has cancelled because of a violation of its terms, Mr. Walsh, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.521" offset="17717478">Mr. Lenroot, I have no objection but Mr. Smoot said he did have objections and that there was already a provision of the bill dealing with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4411.764" offset="17750392">And he said the bill already takes care of this, I don't want to add, Senator McKellar asked what it is and there was further discussion about who should do what and then Mr. Lenroot said who had sort of dropped out of the conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4426.306" offset="17808593">I should like to suggest to both Senators that the Secretary of Interior has no right or authority under the bill to cancel a lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="4433.372" offset="17836910">Well, all he was doing was saying that you've been discussing this section on the assumption that the Secretary does it but he doesn't, it's the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.129" offset="17867839">I don't think he was expressing any opinion and certainly no conscious opinion as to the effect of this bill on the general existing power of the Secretary over the lands of the public domain.</text>

            <text syncTime="4501.426" offset="18109106">And that mistakes -- you're just human to make mistakes, 2% of mistakes in a transaction of this kind, of this volume is perhaps a little larger than it should be but it's within human nature I think to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4518.139" offset="18175979">Now, sometimes the power to correct the mistake is of great importance in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4525.920" offset="18207013">This would certainly be true if valuable oil lands were given out by mistake under a noncompetitive lease.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.432" offset="18241076">It's certainly would be true if it was bribery or corruption of some kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4540.161" offset="18264064">It would seem to be true with reserve lands, Indian lands, somebody else's land were given out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.533" offset="18289455">Some power quickly and expeditiously to correct mistakes must exist to protect public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="4553.459" offset="18317249">The other side of it is that there are additional cases in which the power quickly to correct mistake is of great importance to competing private interest and it was that Mr. Chief Justice if I could just take a minute to develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="4568.129" offset="18375868">Because this case illustrates how the problems arise and why some reviewing authority is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.798" offset="18418604">There are as I said large volume of leases left under the Mineral Leasing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4584.797" offset="18442533">It's not possible to give a lease either under the Mineral Leasing Act or the Taylor Grazing Act in the same manner that you're awarded television channel or a certificate for an air route.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.822" offset="18498644">There are thousands of them to be done over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="4602.094" offset="18511705">And there is no opportunity at that stage without delaying the whole public business for a hearing noticed to opposing claimants and opportunity for argument and appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4616.221" offset="18568234">As a practical matter, what is done and I think it's about as good a system that one could device.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.330" offset="18596655">What is done is the local office gets these thousands of applications pouring in and it goes through them in chronological order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4632.344" offset="18632704">It knows there are other applications there, there's no doubt about that, but it doesn't know quite what other applications or what land they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4639.676" offset="18662066">And it takes up the first application in point of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="4665.358" offset="18764779">Now, that's what happened in this case, except that the local office made a gross error, the writ that is paid in this case, Justice White was 50 cents an acre for the first year.</text>

            <text syncTime="4820.770" offset="19386493">So he notified Cuccia and Conley as he is required to by the regulation that their application was denied because the land had been leased, he has to state this under the regulation.</text>

            <text syncTime="4894.658" offset="19681991">In other words, it is at this higher stage to the Bureau of Land Management that this becomes in its nature an adversary proceeding and someone looked for the first time to determine which of this competing applicant really is entitled to this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4914.975" offset="19763284">In this case, it appeared that it was Cuccia and Conley that had the prior statutory right to this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.347" offset="19800795">If Boesche had had evidence that he wished to introduce that the probation and the regulation for requesting a hearing is evidenced, the regulations are discretionary but it may well be the segment of the opportunity and one might include that some kind of a hearing would be required in such a case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5499.973" offset="22103228">I am told -- I asked this question of the Bureau of Public Lands and I'm told that this problem has never come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="5507.742" offset="22134366">The reason, as it's explained to me Justice Goldberg is that these leases are usually small expected relief and that for the first period of any lease, I am told that what usually happens is the man who gets the lease, spends his time running around trying to find somebody else who will come and drill on the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.273" offset="22232482">And that therefore, would be the unusual case in which any cause would occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="5548.079" offset="22295698">That the question isn't raised within a rather short time, two or three months, here it is two.</text>
