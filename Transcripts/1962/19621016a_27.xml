            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="12.765" offset="154415">Oh, Mr. Weinberg, yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_d_weinberg" startTime="15.208" stopTime="244.018">
            <label>Mr. David D. Weinberg</label>
            <text syncTime="15.208" offset="164237">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.571" offset="193703">This case is one of an employer voluntarily complying as distinguished from being forced by strike action on the part of his employees to comply with a Hot Cargo Clause which at that time pre-1959 was unquestionably legal and so decided by this very Court in Sand Door.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.849" offset="306761">This Court squarely held in Sand Door that National Labor Policy leaves all employers, including employers in the trucking industry, public utility employers, free voluntarily to perform such agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.067" offset="383666">The question here then is whether the Interstate Commerce Commission can make that conduct which National Labor Policy allows the occasion for retribution whether in the form of withdrawal of a carrier certificate or licensing a competing and rival carriers happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.219" offset="492231">Now, the Interstate Commerce Commission says, “It is not punishing the carrier for voluntary compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.881" offset="526921">It's merely assuring service to the public” and they so argued in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.884" offset="554924">But the short answer to that is another case decided by this very Court, Southern Steamship versus NLRB and this Court admonished the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.094" offset="631724">In that case, not to take a single minded attitude, and in the words of this Court, where the case is not like that in Southern Steamship Company versus Labor Board where the Board was admonished not to apply the policies of its statute, that’s the National Labor Relations Act, so single mindedly as to ignore other equally important congressional objectives and that’s the exact situation we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.697" offset="778115">The ICC is ignoring, negating if you please, the National Labor Policy that supports collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.200" offset="824195">The ICC in effect is interfering with the freedom of contract for a lawful clause, voluntarily entered into by the parties and this is an exact case with Southern Steamship.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.498" offset="893367">Now, the Interstate Commerce Commission can no more be allowed in this case to pursue its objective of providing transportation service to the public without regard to the effect of what it is doing on Congress’ Labor Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.499" offset="961390">Then the National Labor Relations Board in Southern Steamship could be allowed to pursue its policy of reinstating strikers without regard to the effect of what it was doing upon Congress’ mutiny laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.398" offset="1028995">If you remember in Southern Steamship, the Board ordered reinstatement of strikers on a ship. At the same time, there was a question of whether -- by engaging in a strike on a ship, they engaged in mutiny.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>

            <label>Mr. David D. Weinberg</label>
            <text syncTime="282.798" offset="1234526">Well, I think the very decision shows that they weren't mindful when the very basis of this decision was the labor dispute despite their protestation to the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.223" offset="1280293">I think that's very aptly set out in the examiner's opinion, one of the trial examiner's opinion, that was approved by the ICC and was considered by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.783" offset="1326477">This is from the record, page 96.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.689" offset="1338180">Its examiner Priscal's finding and if I may, I'd like to read it to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.799" offset="1362526">I think it's the epitome of this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.868" offset="1378826">The truck line carriers have union contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.601" offset="1393768">The Eastern Nebraska carriers are for the most parts small or relatively small businessmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.604" offset="1417801">Most of them are obviously opposed to unionization of their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.830" offset="1438699">This Commission has no authority, nor means of solving that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.022" offset="1459493">If as some Eastern Nebraska carriers imply, the National Labor Relations Board does not offer a solution to that problem then it obviously is a problem for the legislative branch of the Federal Government that only the Federal Government could solve.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.829" offset="1526680">Certainly, this Commission is in no position to solve it and that's exactly what they were doing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.511" offset="1557400">It is one thing for the Commission to say and by self-serving declaration we are not considering a labor dispute, but as the dissenting judge in lower court said, they spent countless paragraphs after paragraph detailing the labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.901" offset="1626990">Judge Mercer characterized this case in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.322" offset="1648619">He said, “The hardcore of this case is the labor dispute.”</text>
            <text syncTime="390.553" offset="1665546">Absent the labor dispute, we wouldn't be up here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.473" offset="1701282">And that's where they impinge upon another congressional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.140" offset="1731897">The Commission has been somewhat cautious in other cases with regard to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.610" offset="1749765">It's significant to note Mr. Justice that they haven't granted any certificates to any other carrier where there have been labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.570" offset="1797622">They didn't do it in Galveston and their answer in their brief and in that case was that that labor dispute was temporary.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.332" offset="1828655">It was settled in two months, but it doesn't really make any difference from the principle standpoint whether it's two months or eleven months?</text>
            <text syncTime="439.947" offset="1863137">Should that be a standard to be adopted by the Interstate Commerce Commission?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert W. Ginnane</label>
            <text syncTime="1264.372" offset="5160835">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.231" offset="5176299">I would like to summarize first briefly some of the elements of proof of public convenience and necessity on which the Commission acted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.577" offset="5221648">Under our theory of the case, if the Commission's findings as to public convenience and necessity were not supported by conventional elements of proof then the Court does not get to the other question which had been discussed at such length.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.349" offset="5284760">As you've been told, the stockholders of Short Lines, to whom the Commission issued a certificate, are small carriers in Central and Eastern Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.950" offset="5323212">And much of their business is transporting freight from points in Central and Eastern Nebraska, to and from Omaha where it is interlined with the larger interstate carriers for transportation to and from the larger distribution centers such as Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.956" offset="5399176">These stockholder carriers serve a number of towns in Central and Eastern Nebraska which are not served in regular service by any other carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.589" offset="5437733">For example, Clark, one of the 12 stockholder carriers alone serves 12 communities which are solely dependent upon him for regular motor common carrier service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.572" offset="5493635">In 1954, the Teamsters Union sought to organize the employees of the 12 stockholder carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.960" offset="5535222">And without going into details of that, by the beginning of May in 1956, as the Commission found as result of the interstate carriers' compliance with their Hot Cargo Clauses and the collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.004" offset="5599378">As the Commission found in early May, 1956, certain of the stockholder carriers began to experience difficulty in affecting normal interchange arrangements with a larger line haul carriers with whom they have been doing business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.237" offset="5656325">This difficulty was experienced primarily at Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.910" offset="5671058">And consistent of the refusal of many of the larger carriers to accept outbound shipments, their refusal to turnover to the stockholder carriers' inbound shipments which were either routed by shippers over the stockholder carriers or which normally would have been turned over to them for delivery to the interior Nebraska points which they regularly served.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.716" offset="5794252">The Commission while finding that the stockholder carriers at no time experienced a complete shut off in interchange service at Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.081" offset="5839705">And while further finding that Burlington Truck Lines and Santa Fe Truck Line attempted to maintain service which I'd like to discuss later, characterized the situation as far as transportation service was concerned as follows in the record at page 116.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.561" offset="5925595">The breakdown in interchange arrangements at Omaha between the unionized carriers and the stockholder carriers, and the refusal of the unionized carrier to provide pick up and delivery service at establishments where picket lines had been established, has resulted in a substantial disruption in motor service to a large portion of the Nebraska shipping public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.105" offset="6019741">The nature of the impact upon shippers was described by the Commission as follows at page 107.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.070" offset="6055685">As a result of the breakdown of interchange arrangements at Omaha, shippers at interior Nebraska points had experienced delays in the movement of their outbound shipments to destination and consignees at such points have experienced delays, inconveniences, and unforeseen expense distributable to the failure of the originating carriers to -- in effect to maintain adequate interchange service at Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.475" offset="6165295">There was really no dispute about what happened in terms of service to shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.606" offset="6181804">At page 3 of the reply brief, the appellant carriers admit, and I'll -- frankly, I'm taking a bit out of their context, but they admit that many shippers in the area suffered aggravating delays in the delivery of their shipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.694" offset="6242200">Now, the Commission further found that these difficulties which began in May, 1956, were continuing to be experienced up to and including the date of the hearing, and by that, the Commission was referring to the hearing on the second application which began on April 4, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.050" offset="6319522">In other words, by that time, the deterioration in the interchange at Omaha had persistent for 11 months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.912" offset="6355048">Again, the Commission did not find that there was a complete cessation of interchange, a complete breakdown of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.574" offset="6385664">In candor, I must point out that the record shows that shipments did eventually move somehow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.525" offset="6425475">Now, to rebut this finding of deficiencies, in the service to shippers, the appellant carriers do primarily two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.889" offset="6458911">First, they refer to the Commission's finding and I quote, “That at no time has the boycott against the stockholder carriers been completely effective in that at no time has interchanged with a larger unionized carriers then completely shut off.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.725" offset="6510320">For example, Burlington Truck Lines and Santa Fe which are rail subsidiaries, a period of accepted interline traffic from the stockholder carriers more or less regularly and to have generally maintained a normal interline relationships to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.052" offset="6575626">And then from this, the appellant say, there's nothing in the record to suggest that the available physical capacity of Burlington and Santa Fe could not have taken care of all of all of the traffic involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.730" offset="6626304">Now, we don't think the record quite shows that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.634" offset="6637902">To begin with, I want to make it clear, nobody in this whole proceeding of this litigation has disputed the adequacy of the physical capacity, physical transportation capacity of the large interstate carrier serving Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.135" offset="6703940">The question has been whether it was sufficiently made available to shippers but the physical capacity is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.241" offset="6732361">However, the Commission also adapted the finding of examiner discovery about the Santa Fe and Burlington service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.832" offset="6762663">He said, there's no doubt that some carriers like Burlington and Santa Fe accepted traffic but even those carriers did not maintain the same free and open interchange service in effect before May 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.313" offset="6820655">In many or most instances, the interchange traffic had to be handled at the terminal by a supervisory personnel because the employees normally are handling such traffic wouldn't touch it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.235" offset="6872273">Now we submit that the Commission was not required to consider the physical capacity of Burlington and Santa Fe where the availability of that capacity, the shippers was measured by the cargo handling capacity of supervisory personnel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.912" offset="7527006">It's based upon the finding of examiner Gresco in the record at page 94 and 95.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.808" offset="7558562">And he said and I quote, “For business reasons, some of the principal Omaha carriers like Watson Brothers and so on, declared that a new policy have been adopted about April 3, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.448" offset="7605164">That management policy is to the effect that serious and persistent attempts will be made to interchange freely and normally at Omaha.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.069" offset="7635675">It was explained that where picket lines exist, there might still be difficulties in interchanging traffic in normal fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.684" offset="7666082">And the examiner concluded, this was his opinion, not binding upon the Commission, all fair indications are that under the leadership of these large and progressive carriers, other Omaha truck line carriers will strive to restore normal interchange.</text>

            <text syncTime="1981.909" offset="8030960">Briefly, it's undisputed that during an 11-month period preceding the second hearing, there was a sufficient interruption in interchange at Omaha to, in the words of the appellant carriers in their reply brief, to subject many shippers to aggravating delays in the deliveries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.172" offset="8116015">Now, under the standards applied by the Commission in hundreds of cases, sustained by this Court, the Commission was warranted in these facts to find that the present and future public convenience and necessity by conventional standards warranted the establishment to the authorization of a new service tailored to the needs of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.065" offset="8211623">Here, the Commission granted only a fraction of the authority requested by Short Lines.</text>

            <text syncTime="2044.495" offset="8281318">On an analysis of shipper needs and service deficiencies, they got only the authority to serve Omaha on the list and the distribution centers of Chicago, Kansas City and St. Louis on the East, limited in both directions to shipments originating in or destined to Alaska -- toward Nebraska.</text>

            <text syncTime="2798.810" offset="11298565">Well may I -- may I answer you at some length as to why that -- why is that inherent in the situation, why the Commission did not proceed by a cease-and-desist order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.798" offset="11334614">First, by way of context and this is an important context, in a wide variety of situations, hundreds and hundreds of cases, the Commission has dealt with demonstrated inadequacies in the sources of existing carriers by authorizing an additional service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.222" offset="11412250">As the court below instinctively recognize in its opinion, the Commission has proceeded that way from the beginning for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.588" offset="11437746">It conserves its administrative resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.357" offset="11448822">It doesn't have the resources to please carrier service performance around the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.489" offset="11469302">We don't attempt to and secondly, it provides the spur of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.093" offset="11491767">And as I say, that is our approach -- has been the Commission's approach in dealing with service inadequacies in thousands of cases, not just this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.720" offset="11526248">It's hard to think of a situation in which the Commission has dealt with the demonstrative service inadequacy by existing carriers who have the authority by telling them through a cease-and-desist order to meet the service need.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.691" offset="11582151">Secondly, when a proceeding starts out like this, the applicant applying for certificate in the existing carriers protesting, I'm quite sure that that proceeding can't go off like this and result in the issuance of a cease-and-desist order against the existing carriers, unless at some point there's been a formal notice given that such -- that such an order may be the result of proceeding and by that time, the proceeding might be very far advanced indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.441" offset="11713181">And finally, proceeding by cease-and-desist order and only -- only by cease-and-desist order means that the Commission cannot provide for immediate service needs by temporary authority for more than a 180 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.456" offset="11789145">They can issue a temporary authority for a hundred -- more than 180 days only while it is determining and acting upon an application for temporary authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3017.176" offset="12172100">The Galveston Truck Lines asked for a certificate arising out of the same type of situation, a breakdown and interchange with other carriers by who -- that were -- who are honoring their Hot Cargo Clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.615" offset="12229883">That interruption of service lasted only two months and that it ended several months before the application for the certificate was filed to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.514" offset="12261439">The Commission said, “We aren't going to grant any certificate under these facts.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.207" offset="12276172">But that was in contrast to this case, and this case involved an 11-month interruption in service which was continued at the time of the record before the Commission was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.318" offset="12312639">So by -- so in answer to your question, Mr. Chief Justice, under your facts, if that interruption to the ship -- of the service to the shipping public had continued for 11 months, I must assume that the Commission would take the same action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3866.569" offset="15569690">The result will be almost invariably service at the higher rates, a combination of local rates, instead of a normal interchange service on a single bill of lading at a normally lower joint rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.230" offset="15636250">That was one of the things that was happening to shippers in this case in Central Nebraska.</text>

            <text syncTime="3890.716" offset="15666239">The inbound shipments would be transferred by the -- by the interstate carrier to a railroad at Omaha and be delivered by rail, usually with delays to the interior point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.252" offset="15712423">But how did it move?</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.467" offset="15717230">It moved at a combination of the inbound motor carrier rate to Omaha and the local rail rate from Omaha to the interior point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.975" offset="15759235">That can range from 25% to 50% to 100% higher than the -- through motor carrier joint rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.375" offset="15792880">So the -- that the Planters Nut case shows one of the inherent defects in trying to restore adequate service to a cease-and-desist order, because by the time you get to the end of that road, the carrier is free as a matter of law to cease participating in a through-service at a single bill of lading and at joint rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="4114.451" offset="16561194">I may -- I would like to tell you just a little bit about the background of this proceeding and what precipitated the application, its all in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.225" offset="16596302">However, I think the local situation is important as to determine the election of remedies that we sought here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.868" offset="16630888">I had represented many of these small drastic carriers for some years and as the record shows, they are quite small.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.870" offset="16666833">Some of them have four or maybe five trucks, Clark being the largest by far with some 40 trucks, but on a national scale, they are very small carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.758" offset="16718451">And for instance, one of them Fremont Express' gross revenue for a year was just about $20,000. So you can see that they have very limited financial means or financial facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.533" offset="16785533">Now, we filed this application actually as a joint enterprise for the obvious reason that no single one of them could have afforded to go into a proceeding of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.649" offset="16841958">$37,500 doesn't seem like much money perhaps to many large carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.158" offset="16860035">It was an enormous amount of money for many of these carriers to raise.</text>

            <text syncTime="4211.337" offset="16948746">Now, we filed this application as it has been pointed out under Section 207 of the Act and proceeded with it just as it would be any other public convenience and necessity case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.052" offset="16995558">Throughout these proceedings and I'm sure it's not in the record, there has been some mentioned made as to union organizers working in Nebraska in 1954 and I don't know where that came from, perhaps it incurred some in the brief or a litigation but I don't believe it's in the record and if they were there, certainly, some of my clients didn't know they were around because they never talked to them, they never talked to the -- their employees and maybe they were there but we didn't know about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.901" offset="17122931">Now, be that as it may, when this service deteriorated, we had to do something.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.741" offset="17162324">These small carriers were conducting their regular operations to and from Omaha on their regular schedule basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="4272.506" offset="17193357">And they started getting their complaints from the receivers of the freight and there was nothing they could do about it when this service stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.302" offset="17228570">Repeated request were filed with these carriers and the receivers of the merchandise complained and it was -- it would to offer situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.094" offset="17275800">And as this record shows, we attempted to prove the standard elements of a public convenience and necessity case which has been outlined by the Commission in the old Pan-American Bus Line's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4307.208" offset="17332224">Whether there is a real public demand in need for the service, whether the existing carriers are willing to provide that service and third, whether it can be inaugurated by unduly impairing the operation of the existing carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.132" offset="17387917">Now, we believe that we amply support the findings of the Commission in the issuance of the authority which it did grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.855" offset="17418742">There were some -- well, in excess of 50 public shipper witnesses who appeared and testified before the Commission examiner and outlined their extreme difficulty in conducting their business because they depended upon this transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.255" offset="17484361">These small carriers and the aggregate served over 200 Nebraska communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.709" offset="17502229">And as Mr. Ginanne pointed out, many of the small communities are entirely dependent upon these carriers for service to conduct their -- and to receive their daily needs of living.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.454" offset="17553220">And when that service stops, it was catastrophic as far as some of these interior towns were concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="4504.014" offset="18119450">My time is short and I would like to touch briefly upon the election of the remedy which we sought here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.983" offset="18143274">There's been quite a bit of argument about the proper thing to have done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4516.751" offset="18170337">Now, we did not file a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.122" offset="18187891">We did not go to the National Labor Relations Board or seek any of those remedies for the reason we didn't think we had time and those that had previously done so had been entirely unsuccessful in getting any relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.857" offset="18250794">Clark, one of the stockholders had been having some labor difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4541.804" offset="18270542">He's the only one, but the experience of Clark showed us that it was fruitless to attempt to work through the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.980" offset="18311293">Clark had a picket line established September 15, 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.982" offset="18331251">On October 1, 1955, unfair labor charges were filed against the Teamsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.970" offset="18351208">This is all in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.902" offset="18358941">On December 7, 1955, a settlement agreement was made between Clark and the Teamsters and the notices were posted about the various truck line terminals that they were not to interfere with Clark or that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4578.969" offset="18419231">On February 15, 1956, a complaint was issued by the National Labor Relations Board against the Teamsters Union for its failure to comply with that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4590.086" offset="18463744">Now, we're getting up to the time where all the other breakdown takes place, but we of course were familiar with what had happened to Clark.</text>
            <text syncTime="4599.519" offset="18501465">Then on July 6, 1956, the National Labor Relations Board examiner issued his report and findings and found that the union had been conducting unlawful picketing about Clark's place of business and suggested that it be stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="4615.495" offset="18565308">At case -- that examiner's report of course was later appealed, but then, on July 30th, 1956 and to me this is what broke the camel's back, a temporary injunction was issued and signed by the chief judge for the District of Nebraska against the Teamsters Union and ordering them to cease these unlawful activities insofar as Clark was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4641.792" offset="18670529">And the record shows that the unionized carriers paid no attention to that order and certainly, if they're not going to pay any attention to the order issued by a federal judge, they're not going to pay attention to a cease-and-desist order issued by the Interstate Commerce Commission or the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4661.112" offset="18747852">So it's our belief that was the only last thing we could do, was to ask for operating authority in order to render the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4671.577" offset="18789648">And I still think we were right and I think we amply sustained a need for that service and the Commission so found and so did the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4679.682" offset="18822144">We ask your affirmance to that order.</text>
