            <text syncTime="48.960" offset="299238">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="50.249" offset="304358">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.947" offset="319195">This is a Labor Board case here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.285" offset="344482">The question presented is whether an employer and a labor union representing its employees may without violating the National Labor Relations Act execute a collective bargaining agreement which leaves each employee free to join the union or not as he chooses, but which requires every employee as a condition of employment to pay the union a sum or sums equivalent to its initiation fee and periodic dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.855" offset="486797">Such a contract is called the “agency shop”.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.486" offset="505292">It contrasts with the pure union shop and that the union shop in its pure form required membership as a condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.050" offset="551581">This, I say, does not require membership but requires merely the payment of sums equivalent to those that -- that union members would pay.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="120.769" stopTime="128.345">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="120.769" offset="586480">It would be fair to say that it requires all the burdens of membership if it confers not all the benefits of membership.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="128.345" stopTime="165.152">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="128.345" offset="616782">No, I don't think that would be fair to say, as I shall develop a little later in my argument, it's entirely clear under this proposal and under the existing General Motors UAW contract that anyone who pays the money is entitled, if he alleged that it's entirely his right in his free election to all the benefits of membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.445" offset="709151">So that I think it's not fair to say that there are any burdens imposed on anyone unless he chooses to suffer the burdens and not have the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.506" offset="745409">That's a matter of contract right and it was clearly implicit in the union's proposal.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="165.152" stopTime="170.953">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="165.152" offset="764008">I don't -- I still don't think get your answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.576" offset="773726">In other words, you're saying this is the same as membership.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="170.953" stopTime="279.523">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="170.953" offset="787205">I'm saying that this is the -- well, I'm saying that anyone who offers to pay these sums is entitled to be a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.948" offset="839137">And therefore, it seems to me unfair to say that any burdens are put on him without the benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.613" offset="869857">Now, he may wish, and this is the theory of the agency shop, he may wish not to engage in personal association with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.047" offset="911548">He may feel that that requires a surrender of individual liberty of a character which is somewhat different from simply paying a tax, if you will, equivalent contribution, but that is left up to the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.253" offset="984377">The point that I did want to emphasize, Mr. Justice, if you will look at page 101 of the record, the General Motors-UAW contract, down at the very bottom of the page, stipulates the union shall accept into membership each employee covered by this agreement who tenders to the union the periodic dues and the initiation fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.423" offset="1097017">So that anyone who pays these sums could join the union and have all the privileges of union membership without doing anything more than paying those sums.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.741" offset="1146337">And it's quite clear that that was the nature of the union's proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.344" offset="1160756">So if he has benefits with -- has burdens without benefit that is his voluntary surrender of a perfectly clear right, and I don't think that I simply wouldn't apply the term burden to that situation.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="279.523" offset="1221465">Well, on the case of pension funds, Mr. Solicitor General, do you have to become a member as well as pay these equivalent sums?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="289.103" stopTime="307.808">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="289.103" offset="1259813">Well, the normal collective bargaining pension fund is applicable to all the employees in the union and such funds are common even though there is no union shop clause or -- and no Agency Shop Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.152" offset="1319999">There are some unions which operate their own pension funds for members.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="byron_r_white" startTime="307.808" stopTime="310.711">
            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="307.808" offset="1334627">This is what I'm talking about.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="310.711" stopTime="561.080">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="310.711" offset="1346226">This contract, as I understand it, would not -- well this union, I believe, doesn't operate any such pension fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.291" offset="1376528">And I don't think these payments would include any contribution to a pension fund if they're not entitled to recover.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.663" offset="1410069">This would certainly, in any event, I think it's important to remember how this case comes up, this arises simply on the union proposal that the company bargained for the proposed Agency Shop Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.368" offset="1472867">And if there are any details in the exact form of the Agency Shop Clause, it would make a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.244" offset="1496377">I don't think there are.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.780" offset="1502542">And surely, the company's reply should have been not an absolute refusal to negotiate but a sitting down and negotiating for the purpose of ascertaining what -- making minor changes or ascertaining just what it was that the union meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.320" offset="1572655">The question arose for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.122" offset="1591881">General Motors and the UAW have long had a national union shop agreement, but it is applicable by its terms only in those states in which union, compulsory union membership agreements have not been outlawed by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.558" offset="1669622">The agreement was not applicable in Indiana because Indiana does have a law that requires -- that prohibits contracts requiring union membership as a condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.557" offset="1721553">In 1959, an Indiana appellate court held that the state statute did not forbid the agency shop and that the agency shop since it did not require this personal association was lawful under the Indiana statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.618" offset="1793860">The UAW then requested General Motors to bargain an Agency Shop Clause applicable to the Indiana employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.935" offset="1827088">General motors categorically refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.734" offset="1842343">Upon those facts, the Board first held that the refusal was not an unfair labor practice, but later on a motion for reconsideration, changed its view and held that General Motors had committed the unfair labor practice of refusing to bargain collectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.970" offset="1923218">It ordered General Motors to bargain and that is the order that the Court of Appeals set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.315" offset="1952684">You'll note that the issue thus raised is truly very narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.274" offset="1972433">General Motors is guilty of a refusal to bargain if, but only if, the Agency Shop Clause is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.838" offset="2006706">The Agency Shop Clause is admittedly valid so far as Indiana law is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.202" offset="2032201">It's also admittedly invalid, one might say, under the National Labor Relations Act as either discrimination to induce union membership or as interference of coercion with the freedom of choice, unless it falls under the proviso to Section 8 (a) (3) which are the statutes at the last page of our brief, which provides that nothing in the Act or any other federal statute, shall preclude an employer from making an agreement with a labor organization omitting a few words to require as a condition of employment membership therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.555" offset="2233553">Plainly, the proviso covers the union shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.423" offset="2249017">The question here is whether it covers the contract much more tolerant than personal liberty and of freedom of choice under the Act which requires each employee to pay the equivalent of the initiation fee and dues, but does not require him in any personal sense to become a member of the labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.142" offset="2343894">The court below --</text>

            <text syncTime="561.080" offset="2347656">I still have a little philosophical difficulty in understanding this -- understanding why you say that an agency shop is so much more of power than much more liberal -- liberal with respect to an individual employee, the employee has to pay exactly the same initiation fee and dues as a member, General.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.725" offset="2434278">And then, it's up to him whether or not he wants to get anything for that money, but that fee -- isn't that it?</text>

            <text syncTime="593.410" offset="2477014">I suppose not everyone would agree, but certainly there are many people who feel that what you do with your money and what you are obliged to do isn't the only measure or even the most important measure of your individual liberty.</text>

            <text syncTime="694.197" offset="2880136">And this indeed is the first reason on which I argue that the Court of Appeals is wrong, because the true union shop is no longer required under the Taft-Hartley Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.026" offset="2935515">That is made quite apparent by the second proviso of the Section 8 (a) (3) over on page 46.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.261" offset="2972400">The second proviso most of the Court will recall, provides that no employer shall justify any discrimination against the employee for nonmembership in the labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.751" offset="3018376">If he has reasonable grounds for believing that membership was denied or terminated for reasons other than the failure of the employee to tender the periodic dues and the initiation fees, he's not required to be a member in any other sense, then that he must tender the periodic dues and initiation fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.048" offset="3103535">Certainly, it's not so required as a condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.039" offset="3119522">And the Court pointed this out in the Radio Officers' case in a passage that's quoted in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.646" offset="3145958">The point Justice Stewart that I did want to emphasize and perhaps I became a little too enthusiastic was this matter of their being -- these employees who don't join and who are subject to the agency shop being forced to carry additional burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.910" offset="3206980">I do think that there's no merit to that argument because of this clause in the General Motors contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.148" offset="3239999">The General Motors contract itself dramatizes the insignificance of this purely formal difference between the Union Shop Clause as it exists under the Taft-Hartley Act and the Agency Shop Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.917" offset="3311052">If you look again at page 101 of the record, where the General Motors contract is set forth, and I'm looking at paragraph 4 (a), it provides that any employee who is not a member of the union shall become a member of the union within 60 days and so forth, and shall remain a member of the union to the extent of paying an initiation fee and the membership dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.695" offset="3426200">In other words, the only thing that the clause the General Motors says is valid under the National Labor Relations Act requires nothing more than paying the initiation fee and dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.051" offset="3475623">What the Agency Shop Clause required is paying a sum equal to the initiation fee and dues, and I suggest with all respect that that certainly tweedledum and tweedledee and nobody has any suggest -- ever suggested any meaningful difference between the two.</text>

            <text syncTime="870.565" offset="3585651">No, I think it suggests if counsel will forbid me, that the UAW was wrong and not contending that the present contract is an Agency Shop Clause under Indiana law.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.461" offset="3637164">I say wrong, they may have had reasons that I'm not aware of.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.595" offset="3649703">All I meant to imply was the argument certainly could be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.102" offset="3675826">Our second reason for rejecting the argument that was advanced by General Motors and was espoused by the Court of Appeals is that it disregards the office and function of the proviso as revealed both by the structure of the statute and by its legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.523" offset="3765478">If you were to take Section 8 (a) (1) prohibiting interference, coercion, and restraint where the rights are guaranteed in Section 7, and where to take Section 8 (a) (3) prohibiting discrimination that encourages or discourages membership in any labor organization, and where to have stopped there, then of course, all forms of Union Security Clause: union shop, agency shop, closed shop, all the rest of them, would have been unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.626" offset="3901837">Now, the office of the proviso was to say that in collective bargaining, you may go up to a certain point.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.819" offset="3938617">We're going to qualify these rights once the union becomes the bargaining representative up to a certain extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.734" offset="3974353">And it makes -- there's no earthly reason from the standpoint of that policy to distinguish between the agency shop or the preferential shop or the Maintenance of Membership Clause, or any other form of the union security which is more consonant with the guarantees of freedom of choice and individual liberty than the strict closed shop as it originally was.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.073" offset="4087620">Now, this is not just a matter of speculation on my part, the legislative history of the Wagner Act makes it perfectly clear that the purpose of the proviso was to preserve to unions and employers in negotiations with them the status quo with respect to the power of contracting once the union had become the bargaining representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.456" offset="4185213">The Senate committee report stated that the bill does not interfere with the status quo on this debatable subject, but leaves the way open to such agreements as might now be legally consummated and of course they included even that early, a variety of forms of what we now call ‘Union Security Clauses' which were then usually loosely referred to as the closed shop whether they were closed shop clauses or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.144" offset="4303914">Our third reason for rejecting the interpretation below and for supporting the Board's interpretation is that the interpretation below would defeat while the Board's interpretation would advance that one of the basic statutory policies, that's the policy of encouraging the representatives of employees and the employers to work out the issues between them by collective bargaining and by negotiation in an effort to write those contracts which are most consonant with their individual needs and aspiration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.625" offset="4481860">The great virtue of collective bargaining is its flexibility, its adaptability, its creativity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.078" offset="4507669">I think one can say that for half a century there's been no more explosive issue than the union security question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.059" offset="4547584">What the interpretation below does is to outlaw most, if not all, the variance of the Union Security Clause that have been negotiated and worked out over the past 25 years by employers and unions in collective bargaining and to restrict them to one of the more stringent forms of the Union Security Clause, take it or leave it, without any room for this flexible, adaptable, creative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.535" offset="4677465">And I emphasize that this would be the consequence not only in Indiana but in every state where we're now disputing not the Indiana law but the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.583" offset="4741726">I would illustrate this point because I think it's very important, by just four examples of the kind of clauses that have been worked out over the past quarter century which would be outlawed certainly by the logic of the respondent's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.767" offset="4826467">Now take first the so-called Union Preference Clause which was brought into prominence by Louis Brandeis before he became a member of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.144" offset="4859904">That Clause requires an employer to give preference to union members in new hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.286" offset="4892505">It does not require any existing employee to become a member of the union as a condition or employment or require any employee to maintain membership after he's been employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.432" offset="4941093">It does not even make union membership an absolute requirement for being employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.649" offset="4969932">Under respondent's argument, this clause would, so far as I can see, unquestionably be illegal because it does not literally require membership as a condition of employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1256.088" offset="5127711">And it's not of importance today, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.504" offset="5157386">That remained true up until 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.299" offset="5164596">But of course today you can't discriminate in hiring because the Taft-Hartley Act outlaws the closed shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.578" offset="5193644">But remember, we are construing not just the current statute, but a proviso that goes all the way back to the Wagner Act when this was important and the Preferential shop Clause does show this intent of the Congress because the Senate Labor Committee explicitly refer to the preferential shop in saying that one of the purposes of the proviso is to make it possible to negotiate preferential shop centrally.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.063" offset="5455600">Also, it gave effect to notions of freedom of contract and responsibility of contract by saying that if you do enter into the relationship, you may bind yourself and indeed must bind yourself for a certain period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.076" offset="5511711">The Maintenance of Membership Clause does not unconditionally require membership of employees as a condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.840" offset="5550686">It requires only those who have voluntarily chosen to join to be members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.784" offset="5570539">So again, there's something taken off the literal words in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.774" offset="5590497">Our third illustration is the so-called Harmony Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.481" offset="5617246">There have been a number of employers who very genuinely accepted collective bargaining and were desired to encourage the union, believe that the union should be secured to plan but were unwilling to take the final step of telling an employee, “You're fired unless you will join the union.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.870" offset="5702823">And many of those employers have mediated disputes in this fashion signed the contract requiring the employer to call the employees in and urge them to join the union and tell that the employer believed in the union and in collective bargaining, but left him free not to take that final step.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.115" offset="5787878">Now, under the respondent's interpretation of that kind of clause, clearly, with that kind of activity and the clause calling for it, would clearly be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.768" offset="5830405">Finally, I should point out that also the term ‘agency shop' is of comparatively reasonable advantage, the substance of what is required by an Agency Shop Clause that goes a good deal for the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.546" offset="5893517">The War Labor Board ordered employers and unions to include in their collective bargaining agreements, clauses that stipulated that no employee should be required to be a union member as a condition of employment, but it also stipulated that every employee in the bargaining unit must pay support money where it's frequently called, equal to the initiation fee and dues as a condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.246" offset="6016397">Another variant of what's essentially the same thing was sometimes described as the compulsory check-off without the closed union shop which again required this financial support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.590" offset="6073762">The best known instance was the Rand formula, as it was called, because of an arbitration award by Justice Rand of the Supreme Court of Canada which disposed of a dispute between Ford and the UAW in Canada in that fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.905" offset="6150980">These practices are important for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.705" offset="6170206">First, I think they demonstrate the importance of my point that the policy of the Act requires an interpretation that leaves a room for bargaining rather than constricts the bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.792" offset="6222555">Second, they represent a practical interpretation of the proviso to the Wagner Act during the 12 years between the adoption of the Wagner Act and the enactment of the Taft-Hartley amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.284" offset="6284518">And Congress surely acted, indeed we know Congress acted and continued to use the words after the parties in collective bargaining had been negotiating since the contract often under government offices for 10 or 12 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.981" offset="6351287">Third, we know that the Rand formula and other information of this kind, was in fact called to the attention of the Congress, as I have pointed out in my brief at the time of the Taft-Hartley debates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.284" offset="6420459">Indeed, Senator Taft in discussing the conference report referred to the Rand formula with approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.303" offset="6448567">And said this is in effect what we have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.304" offset="6464554">We have set up a system under which the union may get the financial support without the other burdens on employees that are required by the strict union shop the a fortiori the closed shop contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.529" offset="6753468">If the Court should decide that the agency shop comes under Section 14 (b), then a fortiori it must reverse the decision below in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.988" offset="6807280">The converse is not necessarily true if the Court were to interpret the words requiring union membership therein very strictly, very literally, it might still conclude that that was the definition of the outer line of the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.016" offset="6887424">And that if you're looking at it in terms of the policy of the National Labor Relations Act, unions may go up to the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.280" offset="6916472">You're looking at it in terms of what the States may do, you come from the other side and the line would then define.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.742" offset="6946356">I point out the possibility the view of the National Labor Relations Board is that the words were used in the same sense, that the words requiring membership in a union as a condition of employment were used somewhat loosely to symbolize all forms of compulsory connection with the union, and that they cover the agency shop in both instance -- instances, and indeed, we think we are aided in this respect by the legislative history of Section 14 (b).</text>

            <text syncTime="1853.472" offset="7517288">It's a payment of that kind that I refer to as a true service fee, something in exchange for considerations rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.766" offset="7554487">The Board held in a Homan case, cited in our brief that such a system with the payment of the service fee was consistent with the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.318" offset="7612688">Now, I would say that that kind of contractual arrangement was valid entirely without regard to the proviso of the Section 8 (a) (3) because it's not interference, coercion, or restraint to stay with the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.699" offset="7670157">And equally, I would say, that the State may not forbid such a service fee under Section 14 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.463" offset="7705266">Then the question arises, well how far do you carry this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.272" offset="7724492">Take in one further illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.333" offset="7736717">One of the very heavy financial burdens on a local union is the cause of arbitrating grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.133" offset="7763884">Arbitrators charge quite a fee and both sides frequently think that they need lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.986" offset="7787290">A union might conceivably set up sort of an insurance fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.291" offset="7800560">Everybody who must contribute to the fund as sufficient premium to pay the expected annual or five-year cause of arbitration wouldn't that also be a service fee at outside the scope of Section 14 (b)?</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.771" offset="7870464">And I would say, yes, that it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.108" offset="7883839">It seems to me that it's like the Homan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.247" offset="7896377">Now, if you -- as you keep adding the things covered by the service fees, you obviously get closer and closer to the union shop and the question would arise where if this distinction has validity, is the line to be drawn between them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.362" offset="7976835">It would seem to me that in terms of the underlying policies, that the line, we've spelled this out at more length in our brief, that the line should surely be drawn between those things like the collective bargaining contract, grievance arbitration, the hiring hall, of where the employee gets some direct and immediate benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.360" offset="8096789">And those things that unions engage in which may go counter to the political or social or economic views of the employee, political activities, lobbying, legislative activity, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.983" offset="8167320">I'm suggesting this distinction essentially for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.471" offset="8189262">I'm not sure that it's important in any case before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.930" offset="8203055">I'm suggesting it first because it seems to me important to bear the perimeters of the problem in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.933" offset="8239104">Because it would be unfortunate if the issue doesn't have to be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.271" offset="8256449">That the Court should say anything that shut off a development along these lines which it seems too many of us at least to offer promising opportunities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.661" offset="8314023">In addition, I want to make it very plain that if the Court should hold that a true service fee, not all the union initiation fees and dues that go to a manyfold variety of activities is beyond state control under Section 14 (b), that that certainly would not require an affirmance of the judgment below that the distinctions between a service fee and the agency shop that I have suggested are certainly valid and operate in that direction even if they do not operate in the other.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry S. Benjamin, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2225.565" offset="9005641">I think that I am in substantial agreement with the Solicitor General's statement of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.990" offset="9035316">I think that if I understand his presentation as to what the issue is, we both see the issue as the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.988" offset="9071365">Now, two painters with common colors and a common subject can think two pictures which will have various reactions by various people so too to lawyers with a common set of facts and a common issue can present two pictures which will give varying interpretations depending on where one sits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.081" offset="9171675">In this particular case, I believe the Solicitor General with rather broad strokes has presented the picture within a rather large framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.664" offset="9210023">This picture to us has been out of focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.860" offset="9222771">We believe that on the basis of the facts and the question presented here and in agreement with the Solicitor, there is a narrow issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.420" offset="9257044">And so I would like at the outset, if I may, within the narrow framework against which we ask the Court to view our position very briefly state our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.197" offset="9308139">In this particular matter, a proposal was made to General Motors to enter into an agreement which would condition the continuance of a man's job upon his payment to a labor organization of a fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.394" offset="9384939">The fee in this particular case happening to be equivalent to the membership dues and initiation fees which would be charged to members of the union who might otherwise be covered by a union shop agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.390" offset="9448887">From the outset, we took the position with respect to that proposal that it was invalid; it was in violation of the National Labor Relations Act as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.182" offset="9492146">Our position was that it violated the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.688" offset="9510118">Now, let me turn very quickly to the provisions of the Act which we believe invalidated the proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.347" offset="9540733">Frankly, I listen very attentively to hear the Solicitor General make reference to one section of the statute which we believe is the lifeblood of this whole problem, namely, Section 7, but I did not hear reference to that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.178" offset="9620041">Section 7 spells out the rights of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.694" offset="9638118">That Section says that an employee may have the right to join, to assist, to form, and otherwise carry on legitimate labor organization activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.540" offset="9701543">In 1947, Congress saw fit to amend that Section, to provide that employees might refrain from joining, assisting, or contributing to labor organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.794" offset="9774582">At the end of the amendment to that Section, it inserted these words after indicating that an individual might refrain from joining, assisting, and so forth except to the extent that such right may be affected by an agreement requiring membership in a labor organization as a condition of employment as authorized in Section 8 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.349" offset="9880743">Now, if I understand the Solicitor General's argument, he believes that Section 8 (a) (3) confers certain rights and authorizes certain types of agreements but Section 8 (a) (3) is written in the terms of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.389" offset="9948975">The rights insofar as those of individuals are concerned, are set forth in Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.565" offset="9973635">Every employee has the right absolutely to refrain from joining, assisting, or contribute -- contributing to a labor organization except, except to the extent that there is an agreement that might be entered into under Section 8 (a) (3) which, by the terms of the statute, might be authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.082" offset="10063705">Now, the only agreement that is authorized under Section 8 (a) (3) and the only agreement which will provide some shield for an employer being charged with an unfair labor practice if he should attempt to make an employee pay some money to a labor organization is one which requires membership where the statute clearly says that nothing in this Act shall preclude an employer from making an agreement with the labor organization to require as a condition of employment, membership therein, and then there are other words which are not relevant to the issue here presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.796" offset="10234546">Now, membership and the word -- membership has no unusual meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.828" offset="10266728">When Congress amended the statute, it did not deem it necessary to put in a specific definition of membership in that section of the statute which sets forth definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.405" offset="10313017">Membership simply means the status which one acquires by having a desire to become associated with an organization in having been admitted to that organization after fulfilling whatever requirements and obligations the organization may impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.520" offset="10381458">Now, in this particular case, the record is clear that there are a number of employees and it so stipulated on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.273" offset="10408417">There are a number of employees who have no desire whatsoever to be bound by the agency shop arrangement, to make any contributions to the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.993" offset="10451362">As a matter of fact, the record is also clear in this particular case that those employees who might be obligated to make the contributions which this arrangement would require would not even receive the same treatment as those employees who were members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2606.726" offset="10530252">For example -- for example, the record is clear that those employees who would be covered by the agency shop would never have the opportunity to vote on whether they wanted this arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.843" offset="10578735">The record is also clear that they would not have the right or privilege to attend union meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.442" offset="10601096">They would not have the right of privilege to vote on certain matters with respect to the disposition of certain union funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.229" offset="10624293">The record is clear that they could not even receive the union newspaper which was the document or means by which people covered by the collective bargaining agreement were advised as to what was taking place between the employer and the employee.</text>
