            <text syncTime="54.938" offset="323166">This case is before this Court on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.010" offset="351378">I have agreed with the Government's counsel on the division of the argument in order to avoid any unnecessary duplication.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.406" offset="392965">I will present the factual picture, the history of the case and if time permits, I will briefly summarize our legal position and the Government's counsel will present the legal position in detail, the statutory history, and the statutory policies involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.571" offset="473631">The issue before this Court is both narrow and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.606" offset="501844">Briefly stated, that issue is whether the Federal District Court has the power to prevent serious irreparable injury to competing carriers and to shippers, and the localities by putting into effect certain drastic rate reductions which the Interstate Commerce Commission has declared prima facie unlawful and in a situation where the Interstate Commerce Commission where its power to prevent these rates from going into the effect has been invoked and spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.823" offset="674670">To put the issue in perspective, let me present a brief background.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.760" offset="698389">We have attached a chart to our brief as Appendix B, and it tells most of the story.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.541" offset="725556">I've had it enlarged here for purposes of illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.640" offset="745932">In the upper left hand corner of the chart is the breadbasket of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.861" offset="766830">This is the great grain surplus producing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.298" offset="788564">In the Southeastern part, in the lower right hand corner, the Southeastern part of the United States we have the great grain deficit area today and today, grain moves in tremendous volumes from the surplus area to the deficit area.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.339" offset="876753">It was not always so.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.418" offset="889083">The Tennessee River in its natural state, where the series of (Inaudible) and rapids, and was not completely navigable and the rail rates which were then in effect from the Midwest to the Southeast were prohibitively high.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.859" offset="966823">Consequently there was no major grain industry that developed in these Southeastern states.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.992" offset="995349">After the Tennessee Valley authority constructed a series of dams on the Tennessee River, the river became navigable the year around and it furnished it and its connecting waterways, furnished a natural, logical low cost route for grain to move from the surplus area to the deficit area.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.679" offset="1106108">A large poultry industry developed in the Southeastern states, particularly in Alabama and Georgia, and the low cost water movement made this development possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.913" offset="1155009">A number of elevators, feed mills and so forth were constructed at the Tennessee River ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.061" offset="1187610">The grain would move by barge through or from St. Louis up to Tennessee River to such ports as Guntersville, which was the major one where the development occurred because it was the southernmost point on the Tennessee River.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.054" offset="1255633">The result was that the demand for grain in the Southeast skyrocketed.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.011" offset="1283427">Now this was a tremendous new movement of grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.212" offset="1304221">The movement by barge to the Tennessee River ports, such as Guntersville then transshipped from Guntersville and the other ports to interior destinations in the Southeast, where the grain was consumed, used to feed the poultry, and for the other feed purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.919" offset="1387081">Very little of this grain is actually consumed at the river ports themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.984" offset="1411323">Over 80% of the grain which moves on the Tennessee River is later transshipped to interior destinations, either by barge -- by a trip or by rail and either as grain or as grain products.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.425" offset="1485093">The high rail reshipping charges from the Tennessee River ports to the interior destinations impeded the barge-rail movement of grain into the Southeast, and the railroads persisted in the refusal to publish usable rail rates on the barge grain which arrived at the Tennessee River ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.860" offset="1598777">These reshipping rates after nine years of litigation in the Commission and in the courts were declared unlawful in Arrow Transportation Company against the United States which this Court affirmed per curiam in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.913" offset="1663039">Meanwhile, the barge-truck movement of grain in by barge, out by truck constantly increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.299" offset="1704521">Then in July of 1961, about a year after this decision --</text>

            <text syncTime="433.902" offset="1839000">And in 19 -- in July of 1961, about a year after the Arrow decision, the Southern Railway Company acting independently and without any prior consultation with shippers or other rail carriers published the rates which are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.864" offset="1938787">It proposed to reduce the all-rail rate from the Ohio and Mississippi River ports to specified destinations in the Southeast.</text>

            <text syncTime="929.887" offset="3822947">And we therefore sought the aid of the equity court, seeking to restrain these rates, alleging the traditional grounds for invoking equities jurisdiction and asserting our willingness to indemnify the railroads by bond against any provable damages that they might sustain in the event these rates should later be declared lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.824" offset="3922631">We asked a status quo injunction which would require the railroads to be content with the rates they established for themselves only a few years before, or the temporary period until the Commission could decide this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.605" offset="3997759">Now let me briefly describe these rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.058" offset="4015626">These are multiple-car rates which apply only to those grain dealers, grain receivers who are equipped to receive, unload, store and pay for a minimum of 450 tons or about 16,000 bushels of grain at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.448" offset="4109145">They apply -- they have a $2.40 minimum rate and this minimum rate is absolute up to a distance of 346 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.889" offset="4150941">Now, that means that the shipper who ships 10 miles pays the same rates as one who ships 346 miles and these rates do not apply from the Tennessee River ports to interior destinations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.730" offset="6646262">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.384" offset="6660890">Now this, this destruction to us would come about so quickly within six months and Southern knew this, just as long as we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.956" offset="6695163">The District Court knew it, and the District Court strongly recommended that the Southern voluntarily extend this period for a short time in order that the Commission might pass upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.965" offset="6747199">Southern again refused, referring to -- it inflicted its damage first and then discussed later the lawfulness of the means used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.862" offset="6786800">Now the District Court made every necessary finding for the issuance of the status quo injunction, save one; this one was the question of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.190" offset="6836120">He even went further and balanced the equities between the parties and said that the ends of justice is in his opinion would best be served if this temporary injunctive relief were granted, but lacking jurisdiction he found himself powerless to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.639" offset="6901948">Now the Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that Section 15 (7) of the Interstate Commerce Act, which authorized the Commission to suspend rates in the first instance as impliedly ousted the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court to exercise its ancillary jurisdiction in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.164" offset="7004035">Now I will only briefly summarize our legal position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.853" offset="7018768">We think the legal question can be broken down into two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.745" offset="7034337">First, does the District Court have the inherent power to exercise ancillary jurisdiction to preserve the status of parties in a proceeding before another agency where that agency itself is powerless to act and where the preservation of the status is essential in order to permit that agency to make a decision which will be effective and not obligatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.355" offset="7168815">Now, this question has been discussed in our brief at great length and we think clearly that the Federal District Courts have this inherent equity power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.313" offset="7208626">The more crucial question however, is whether Congress in enacting Section 15 (7) has impliedly taken this power away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.591" offset="7249690">The argument that Congress has impliedly withdrawn this power it seems to me to rest upon a misapplication of the primary jurisdiction doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.468" offset="7297233">Here there is no potential conflict between the agency and the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.055" offset="7327640">The court can do nothing which will either duplicate or anticipate or interfere with the primary responsibility of the Commission to decide the lawfulness and to carry out its statutory powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.099" offset="7387721">The Commission has found these rates to be presumptively unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.447" offset="7405171">The District Court did not find them to be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.237" offset="7416351">He merely accepted the Commission's decision on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.961" offset="7435264">The District Court did not change it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.498" offset="7453341">Judicial intervention here, far from making the Commissions' task more difficult, actually enables the Commission to make an effective decision, one that will be a more than a mere academic interest to my clients.</text>

            <text syncTime="2281.038" offset="9227473">The proposition with which we begin as do petitioners is that it is a traditional function of equity, one which is certainly been performed for many years in Anglo-American history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.704" offset="9302183">To intervene in order to protect a situation from a drastic change while another proceeding is pending elsewhere, the early common laws of course, the other proceeding was ordinarily an action in the lower courts or perhaps from the ecclesiastical courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.103" offset="9391835">But in more recent times one finds more than a fair sprinkling of cases in which the other proceeding is one awaiting adjudication before an administrative tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.611" offset="9449827">Certainly all things being equal, equity may intervene in the latter situation no less than in the former and a line of cases involving the Maritime Commission most sharply illustrates the practice which has grown up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.331" offset="9524746">That Commission has no apparent authority at all to issue an injunction or a stay order or a suspension order while it is investigating the legality of the disputed [Inaudible] statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.470" offset="9601233">But the courts have, several Courts of Appeals of several Circuits have agreed I think without exception, that equity may step into the breach when necessary and preserve the status quo during the tendency of the Commission proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2445.799" offset="9886595">There are two parts to my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.948" offset="9895163">The first part is an attempt to canvass briefly the inherent powers of the court of equity in situations of the type which are presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.481" offset="9949288">The second part will necessarily have to take into account the particular statutory scheme with which we're dealing and the statutory history in order to ascertain whether exercise of this general equity power would be consistent with the -- with what might be called the equity of the statute, the policy that Congress has to plan and I would therefore say in relation to the mediation question which your -- Your Honor presented that that would certainly turn on consideration peculiar to the statutory structure of the Acts which are there relevant just as this case is doing the turn ultimately I suspect on analysis of the scheme of Section 15 (7) and the history of that Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.014" offset="10147401">I was going to suggest in relation to the general equity power that the Court may recall the Isbrandsten case, a Maritime Commission case which was here in the 1957 term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.886" offset="10222947">That involved the question whether an association or conference of water carriers could adapt the so-called the dual rate system, a system whereby shippers paid rates at one level if they signed an exclusive patronage contract with the Conference of Water Carriers, but had to pay rates at a much higher level to all members of the conference with whom they place shipments, if they fail to sign that exclusive agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.529" offset="10365471">Isbrandsten, a lonely, independent in the ocean trade that was involved in that case, challenged the practice and ultimately prevailed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.296" offset="10408521">What maybe forgotten is that back in 1948, almost a decade earlier, Isbrandsten had first questioned that system by a suit in the District Court which sought a temporary injunction to restrain the conference lines from putting it into operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.089" offset="10503711">The injunction was granted in that case on Isbrandsten's representations that it could not long survive if it had to await the prospect of securing relief from the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.381" offset="10556897">And Judge Rifkind's opinion in that case stated, I'm going to quote a line or two because it had some pertinence here, “where the defendant carriers to institute their exclusive patronage system pending the Commission's decision in a complaint proceeding, the plaintiff would be gravely prejudiced since the Commission disclaims the power to afford temporary relief and the equitable power of the court to preserve the status quo has not been withdrawn by statute, an injunction as prayed should issue conditioned on the plaintiff diligent prosecution before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.285" offset="10732544">Are their complaints challenging the validity of the agreements?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.028" offset="10751457">Now, that passage I think brings us to the next question here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2680.541" offset="10825540">I say that that leads to the next question which is whether as the rail carriers in this case argue, the Interstate Commerce Act did withdraw comprehensively as they say and without any possibility of exception, the inherent equitable power to grant relief pending the completion of the administrative proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2718.814" offset="10978617">I think the -- I think the policy of Congress in -- expressed in the statute which -- would be one which this Court would certainly be obliged to regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.994" offset="11031385">I think the standard involved here is perhaps similar to that in the recent view with Robin's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.226" offset="11068270">And I think the Court has stated in that case that a judicial remedy may coexist, may coexist with a comprehensive regulatory scheme when the exercise of the judicial remedy supports the Act's overall purposes and I think the Court's language was -- is and is in nowise inconsistent with the congressional scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.666" offset="11174013">If the scheme here was inconsistent I would assume that the Court would have stay its hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.664" offset="11205987">Now, Southern argues in -- well, it relies on Section 15 (7) which defines the Commission's powers to suspend the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.468" offset="11273279">And that section provides in the substance as Your Honors know that when a carrier files a new or changed the rates, the Commission may upon a written statement of its reasons suspend them for a period, I will now talk about this, I will mention the period in the statute that now stands, for period not to exceed seven months, that period has changed a several times during the history of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.686" offset="11402115">If the administrative proceeding has not then been concluded, the provision continues, the rates shall go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.247" offset="11452374">The succeeding sentence of Section 15 (7) goes on to authorize the Commission to require the carrier to keep detailed accounts of all moneys collected under the new rate schedule and the section then concludes with the direction to the Commission to decide these cases as early as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.709" offset="11550177">Now Southern regards the words, “Shall go into effect,” as working a complete ouster of federal court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.902" offset="11595003">The hitch in that argument as we view it is that we are dealing here with a section which in its entirety is seeking to define the powers of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.750" offset="11646412">It does not in terms address itself at any point to the question, what if any powers may exist outside the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="3056.183" offset="12328103">The essential problem as we view it is not one of jurisdiction in any strict sense, but rather one of accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.441" offset="12389125">Assuming as we do the inherent powers of an equity court in situations of the type here presented, the power to preserve legally protected interests during the pendency of an administrative proceeding, one must ask the question to what extent is this power limited or qualified by policies which have been determined by Congress, that is to say implicit in the statutory scheme or in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.698" offset="12534157">We have no quarrel with respondent's view certainly that the Court must show a fair regard for that statutory scheme and respect those congressional policies which may be discerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.144" offset="12595911">Let me go back to 1910 and consider the situation as it then existed, 1910 of course being the year that the Mann-Elkins Act accorded suspension powers to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.054" offset="12679607">Southern's brief states quite accurately at page 19 and I quote it, “That the Commission was empowered to act only upon complaint and as to a rate that was then in effect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.762" offset="12762467">They are speaking there of the pre-1910 situation, this matter of course that any relief from possibly disastrous consequences pending a commission determination of the legality of the rate had to come from the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.722" offset="12850239">There was however, division and confusion in the lower federal courts as to how they should proceed and as the Interstate Commerce Act then stood there was considerable reason for this uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.900" offset="12934980">For a court to enjoin a rate before there was any determination, even a preliminary one by the Commission as to its probable unlawfulness which seemingly involved the Court at least in a measure in the rate making or at least the rate judging process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.901" offset="13046993">And some of the lower courts feared that enjoining a rate from taking effect might conflict with the spirit of this Court's early Abilene decision which had held that the courts could not grant damages to shippers who had allegedly been charged unreasonable rates in advance of an agency determination, a Commission determination of the issue of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.669" offset="13170082">I might note parenthetically that this Court in the Tift case in 1909, that's Tift against Southern Railway, had left open the question whether the grant of injunctive relief to prevent a rate from taking effect might be distinguished from the bringing of an action at law for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.630" offset="13277915">The fear of possible intrusion on the primary jurisdiction of the Commission apart, there was a second apparent impediment in the pre-1910 period to a grant of injunctive relief for under the literal language of the statute as it then stood, the Commission could take action only in a -- in relation to a rate which was currently demanded, charged or collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3334.439" offset="13441128">If a shipper therefore succeeded in securing an injunction against a carrier's putting a rate into effect, the consequence seemingly would be a permanent injunction rather than mere temporary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.217" offset="13512286">That is to say, if the Court prevented the rate from taking effect the Commission which has the ultimate job under the Interstate Commerce Act of determining the legality of the rates might have been its timing because under a literal language -- under the literal language of the Act the Commission's jurisdiction wouldn't attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.674" offset="13594102">It wouldn't have any power to take any action until the rate was being demanded, charged or collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.557" offset="13633599">A few courts, notwithstanding these problems, did grant injunctive relief in the pre-1910 period whereas others concluded that the grant of injunctive relief would interfere with the primary jurisdiction of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.097" offset="13711757">It was in this posture with the equity decisions of the day in a highly confused state that the shippers, shippers went to Congress with a request that the Commission be accorded powers to grant suspensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.648" offset="13817919">The administration, the Taft administration supported this idea and an administration measure was introduced, though it proposed merely a power to suspend for a 60-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.880" offset="13902869">The shippers, at least at their most extreme, sought suspension of every rate and suspension for an unlimited period; that is until the administrative proceeding was completed however long that might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.052" offset="13987610">The carriers on the other hand understandably wished to confine the suspension power if it were granted as narrowly as possible and to have it for a short period.</text>

            <text syncTime="3495.087" offset="14083741">There was at one point an amendment which would have had that as one of several consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.634" offset="14117909">The shippers advanced the arguments by and large that damages represented a delayed and a sometimes inadequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.754" offset="14166392">The carriers took the position that to the extent rates were held up or delayed that they would suffer a loss which could not be recouped, that loss of course occurring if the rates ultimately proved lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.013" offset="14243401">Congress ultimately compromised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.369" offset="14260851">As the debate shaped up in both Houses, the principal controversy became one between the advocates of a limited period of suspension and the proponents of unlimited suspension and as I say a bargain was reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.153" offset="14332008">Congress did not provide either for an unlimited period of suspension or for automatic suspension of every rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.741" offset="14366386">It did give the Commission discretion and it did extend the period for which the rates might be suspended from 60 days which was the original proposal to ten months.</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.578" offset="14433677">Most Congressmen apparently believed and this was repeatedly stated in the debates that this ought to be a sufficient period within which to complete proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.798" offset="14482578">A number of the legislators expressly noted that they opposed unlimited suspension because they wished to put some pressure on the Commission to get cases out of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.791" offset="14538585">They did not want to give the Commission carte blanche to stay the rates indefinitely, a possible prejudice as to carriers but to make every effort to accelerate the disposition of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.216" offset="14604204">Now, there was some discussion, it was not extensive, as to whether equity could intervene if the Commission failed to complete its task during the suspension period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.544" offset="14665540">Several Congressmen said that there would be equitable power and several others said equally clearly that they doubted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.746" offset="14706395">I suppose the statements on this point are something of a standoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3654.397" offset="14720920">There is certainly no consensus on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.757" offset="14738369">We do suggest, however, that this is significant that neither those who thought there was power nor those who doubted it suggested that Congress should take away or preclude the exercise that any power that equity might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.529" offset="14833455">I think the only fair inference one can draw from the debates on this point is that Congress was content to leave this question in the lack of support.</text>

            <text syncTime="4110.138" offset="16543953">For the carriers, suspension meant a delay in the loss of the rates ultimately proved to be lawful. For the protestants, a failure to suspend would entail if the rates ultimately proved unlawful, the interim burden of paying higher charges and the possibility that damages might prove incomplete.</text>
            <text syncTime="4133.947" offset="16639143">A shipper for example presumably would be able to collect the excess payments he made to the carrier if the rates proved unlawful, would he be able to prove consequential damages, such as lost business during the period that he was required to ship goods even in a fixed rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4155.639" offset="16725974">As we see it, Congress reached a compromise, it struck a balance between these competing considerations to which it referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.867" offset="16770800">This ordinary hardship associated with having rates in effect during an interim period before there legality is finally determined would've fall upon the carriers for the first period, it's a seven months period if the statute now stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.194" offset="16840182">Thereafter, if the proceeding were not completed, those burdens would be shifted to the shipper or to the competing carriers as the case might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.888" offset="16886888">We don't find any evidence in the history that Congress' countenance, the prospect, that the carriers might be free to shift a burden calculated to destroy the other party or that it was of the view that equity should be precluded in such extreme circumstances from guarding against consequences of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.611" offset="17009768">In short the petitioners here were alleging simply a threatened loss of profits, not the threatened extinction of the business, but the business which itself is affected with the public interest and operates under a certificate of convenience and necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4246.485" offset="17089285">If they were merely claiming possible losses, we would say in the light of the statutory history that they should be relegated to the remedy of damages under Section 8, even if that might prove less than 100% adequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="4304.687" offset="17322088">There appeared to be no reported cases of such.</text>
            <text syncTime="4311.118" offset="17347793">We are suggesting that different considerations apply, considerations to which equity need not be blind.</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.295" offset="17392515">There is ground for believing that the petitioners may have sunk from site before the administrative proceedings concluded and I say that's particularly true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.653" offset="17430026">We believe where public interests which are involved, the public interest in having various modes of transportation is at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="4345.714" offset="17486242">The respondents finally suggest that the Government's view is in conflict with a comment, a dictum which appears in this Court's Great Northern opinion in 1930.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.731" offset="17550294">The Court there did state that Congress in 1910 have entrusted suspension power only to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4374.598" offset="17601808">The significance of that dictum must be appraised in terms of the issue that was actually before the Court and it's worth taking a moment I think to state it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4387.744" offset="17654366">A state regulatory authority in that case had prescribed certain intrastate rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4397.874" offset="17694908">The rail carriers were -- reviewed these were too low.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.126" offset="17715911">They brought a proceeding therefore before the Interstate Commerce Commission under Section 13 invoking the Shreveport doctrine, asking the Interstate Commerce Commission to raise the level of the intrastate rates by finding as is required under the Section that those intrastate rates imposed a discriminatory burden upon interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4433.945" offset="17839104">And while the ICC was considering that matter, but before it had made any finding whatever if there was any burden on interstate commerce, the carriers also went into court to secure an injunction against the rates prescribed by the State Commission while the federal administrative proceeding was pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="4456.228" offset="17928234">Quite properly we think, this Court stated that the judiciary could not interfere with the undoubted regulatory authority of the State which could be overridden only in the manner provided by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4470.181" offset="17984136">That is to say after a finding by the Interstate Commerce Commission which had not been made, that interstate commerce was being prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4480.113" offset="18023842">Now the instant case, in striking contrast to Great Northern, involves no conflict either between federal and state or more pointedly here between judicial and administrative authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4496.156" offset="18087999">When Southern filed its rates in this case there were two issues presented to the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.018" offset="18115480">First, the preliminary issue whether there was reason to believe that the rates were unlawful and should therefore be suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.375" offset="18148916">The Commission has answered that question affirmatively, for a court to accept that determination and to proceed upon the basis of it obviously can work no interference with the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4527.924" offset="18215058">And the second issue before the Commission is the ultimate one on the merits whether the rates are lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4533.988" offset="18239300">And again, no one can suggest that if the status quo is maintained until the Commission can make its final decision on that issue, that they'll be an interference with the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.511" offset="18293426">Stating it bluntly, it can hardly interfere with the Commission's duty to decide whether these rates are going to result in the unlawful destruction of the barge lines, a danger which the Commission itself has at least apprehended by its suspension order, if the courts undertake to keep the barge lines alive until the Commission can write its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.315" offset="18400632">Before closing and I don't know want to trench on my colleague's time any further, I'd like to emphasize that in our view, one seeking an injunction after the statutory suspension period has been exhausted has a very exacting standard to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="4593.240" offset="18476283">We would suppose that he must show injury of a magnitude and gravity which go far beyond the ordinary hardships which might be associated, which Congress we think associated, with having to pay a rate of questionable validity during the interim period.</text>

            <text syncTime="5619.914" offset="22583045">The Southern Railway filed rates in 1961, new rates on grain moving from the river crossings into the territory of the Celtic.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.835" offset="22634663">These rates were drastic reductions of rates already in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5638.475" offset="22657233">I shall later on have occasion to comment on this chart and what it says about those rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5645.442" offset="22685132">I shall content myself at this moment by saying that the rates were drastically reduced because they involved a great innovation in ratemaking and in transportation, and in a moment I should tell you why.</text>
            <text syncTime="5662.436" offset="22753155">The reason for this, the reason why it is an innovation is that, first of all, new cars were designed and built by people who had never built railway cars before the Boeing Aircraft Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.463" offset="22805191">These were aluminum cars that were larger than the ordinary cars.</text>
            <text syncTime="5679.420" offset="22821073">They carried twice the cargo weight at half the dead weight of a car.</text>
            <text syncTime="5685.371" offset="22844897">Again, the rate structure was different.</text>
            <text syncTime="5688.880" offset="22858898">This was a multiple car movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5691.328" offset="22868720">It was -- the series of -- numbers of cars could be moved from one consignor to one consignee without breaking bulk and without, what is called frills, without privileges in transit, in other words, giving the same service to the shipper by rail as was given to him by the barge or buck -- or truck carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5718.972" offset="22979271">That is, it could be moved without breaking bulk in one movement by one consignor to one consignee and these savings prod -- produced a very much lower rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="5735.279" offset="23044472">I have to -- as I say at the end of the period, the Commission suspended the rates for a period of seven months.</text>
            <text syncTime="5745.468" offset="23085223">It found what has been stated to this Court in response perhaps to a question by -- Mr. Justice Harlan, the Commission is not required to find anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="5757.162" offset="23132035">It is only required to give the reason for a suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="5761.250" offset="23148335">It could give it if it like the reason that it thought out in a whole it was a fair thing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.246" offset="23168397">In this case, it found that the Commission had reason to believe that the rates might be illegal and that they're unreasonable and illegal, unlawful rates and that they might be unjust and in violation of the National Transportation Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5788.972" offset="23259303">This was the finding before evidence without hit -- before evidence was taken without hearing, without argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.843" offset="23286784">It need give only its reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5800.303" offset="23304547">At the end of the time as I've said, application was made to a District Court to continue or to give an injunction which would continue this suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="5809.834" offset="23342686">The District Court denied relief finding that it had no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.214" offset="23368182">This went to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit which affirmed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5822.278" offset="23392528">From that time on there have been temporary restraining orders, interlocutory injunctions, pending appeal and pending this hearing granted by the District Court, the Court of Appeals and by a justice of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5837.695" offset="23454177">Now, before turning to argument I should like state to the Court what I would call the anatomy of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5849.358" offset="23500779">What are the issues?</text>
            <text syncTime="5851.014" offset="23507466">What attitudes do the various parties take toward those issues?</text>
            <text syncTime="5857.851" offset="23534738">This is complicated because very often there are three attitudes, one by the respondent, one by the petitioner, one by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5865.107" offset="23563786">I should try to state them all to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5867.249" offset="23572355">Let us start with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5870.800" offset="23586565">As I said the statute, it gives the Commission authority to determine the legality of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="5878.823" offset="23618644">It gives the Commission power to suspend rates but now only for seven months and it then provides that if the Commission has not decided the case, at the end of the period of suspension the rates shall go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5895.885" offset="23686875">It doesn't say they may go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5897.357" offset="23692831">It says they shall go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="5900.982" offset="23707251">Now, let's take up these three statements in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5906.818" offset="23730657">First of all, all parties agree, the respondent, the petitioner, the Government, they all agree that the authority to determine the lawfulness of the rate is given solely to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="5918.989" offset="23779349">No court, nobody else may interfere with the Commission's decision of that question except on appeal after decision is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="5930.262" offset="23824384">Now, so far as suspension is concerned, all parties agree that the authority of the Commission to suspend is in the first instance its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="5945.199" offset="23884152">No court may suspend, unless the Commission has done so first and unless the Commission has given some reason that it believes, there is occasion to believe that the rates may be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5959.613" offset="23941831">There's no question abut that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5961.636" offset="23949876">If the Commission should not suspend, these petitioners would not make the argument that they make here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5968.176" offset="23976103">It would be either agreed by all of us that no court may intervene no matter how great the showing of damage maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="5978.347" offset="24016750">Now, I think it is also agreed, although I'm not so sure of this, I think the -- our two other opponents would agree that if this Commission suspends for less than the full period and then allows the rates to go into effect, no court may intervene no matter how great the damage maybe because there would then be no statement of any sort by the Commission which it is admitted must make this statement that there is reason to believe that the rates would be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="6016.729" offset="24170245">We've come apart when we have the situation created -- that exists here, a situation where the Commission has suspended for the full period of time, and then under the statute the rates shall go into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6036.418" offset="24249031">In that situation, there are three different views.</text>
            <text syncTime="6040.499" offset="24265331">Our own view, the respondent's view is that the power to suspend, to enjoin, to prevent the rates from going into effect has been given solely to the Commission and no one else and that the legislative history to which I shall come to would indicate that that is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6058.580" offset="24337742">And we contend further that there has been a legislative balancing of equities or convenience here, arriving at the conclusion that rates shall not be suspended for more than seven months.</text>
            <text syncTime="6073.933" offset="24399078">That during that time the railroad shall bear the irreparable injury for which it has no action at law if its rates should turn out to be lawful and that thereafter, other parties shall bear whatever burden they bear because they do have rights to recover damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="6093.628" offset="24477863">That is our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="6095.273" offset="24484446">Now the petitioner's view is a different one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6098.794" offset="24498552">The petitioners say that the power of the courts to suspend existed before 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="6107.794" offset="24534497">I shall discuss this later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6111.840" offset="24550693">It says that the Mann-Elkins Act, the Act of 1910 which we have been talking about modified this rate but did not abrogate.</text>
            <text syncTime="6121.220" offset="24588204">It modified it and if it existed before, now, after 1910, it -- an action could not be brought and that's the Commission had taken these prior steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="6134.059" offset="24639613">But if the Commission has then an action maybe brought in to courts, say the petitioners, because the time limit they say applies only to the Commission and not to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6149.377" offset="24700844">Our answers to this will -- perhaps it appeared from what I have said and will appear more later.</text>
            <text syncTime="6156.063" offset="24727594">Now the Government takes a different position from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6160.269" offset="24744417">It takes the position debutante about the situation before 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="6167.425" offset="24773047">Now, it says quite correctly that some courts did intervene a granted injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6173.648" offset="24797915">It referred to Mr. Justice Hughes opinion in the Great Northern case in which it is pure dicta, dicta by a very important and honored judge, who says that in his opinion the better view wasn't before 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="6189.237" offset="24860296">There was no jurisdiction in a court to grant an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6193.986" offset="24879313">But in any rate the Government says, whether or not it existed before 1910, it was created by the Act of 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="6204.027" offset="24919437">The Government says the very opposite of what respondents say.</text>
            <text syncTime="6207.801" offset="24934588">We say the Act of 1910 gave it solely to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="6214.479" offset="24961337">The Government says, no by a curious sort of -- perhaps unintended result, the courts were given this power because once the Commission could find probable cause to believe that there was unlawfulness and issued a suspension order then the courts could do what they had not been able to do before, rely upon the Commission's finding and extend the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6245.725" offset="25086307">But the Government goes on and says that the petitioners are quite wrong in believing that there injunction from the courts maybe activated by a plaintiff who is about to suffer irreparable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="6264.651" offset="25161958">They say this is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6267.132" offset="25171884">Now, whether they say the added requirement as a jurisdictional requirement or not, I gather this morning from my distinguished colleague that he thinks it is a not jurisdictional in addition but it is merely a requirement that the court should be careful how they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="6285.779" offset="25246490">However, he says that he would not believe that an injunction is warranted by a person who appears before the court of plaintiff, who has what he calls, the ordinary or garden variety of irreparable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="6301.605" offset="25309811">Garden varieties won't work in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6305.283" offset="25324544">Now the plaintiff must have what I suppose to bullet -- battle the parley of trade would call a super colossal irreparable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="6313.785" offset="25358503">It must be something the Government says, amounting to extinction or some very grave difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6322.787" offset="25394552">In other words, the propriety of the action is not the jurisdiction to action.</text>
            <text syncTime="6328.550" offset="25417540">It depends upon the degree of the plaintiff's anguish.</text>
            <text syncTime="6332.713" offset="25434258">But it is ordinary -- ordinary anguish, the court may not act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6336.771" offset="25450454">If it is very great anguish then it should act, but the anguish must be quite a bit greater than the ordinary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6346.031" offset="25487548">Now, as had been pointed out, this suggestion is a wholly novel one.</text>
            <text syncTime="6351.135" offset="25507924">This has no basis either in the history of the statute, the legislature -- the legislative history nor does it have any basis in prior court decisions on equity jurisdiction, nor does it have any basis in legal history.</text>
            <text syncTime="6368.826" offset="25578663">This is wholly new.</text>
            <text syncTime="6372.523" offset="25593501">Not only is it wholly new but it raises questions which the Government has not -- to which the Government has not given us the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6380.955" offset="25627146">It is all very well to say that it requires a plaintiff with a super colossal injury to come into court to get the injunction, but for whose benefit does the injunction run?</text>
            <text syncTime="6394.156" offset="25680018">Does the injunction only run for the benefit of those who will suffer this super injury?</text>
            <text syncTime="6401.021" offset="25707499">If that is so then obviously there will be a multiplicity of rates or perhaps the Government suggests that the rights -- rates might be varied according to the degree of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="6412.298" offset="25752534">If a plaintiff comes in and says, “I'm about to be put out off of business,” the junction must issue -- it is at -- going to mean that everyone else is protected whether he -- whether they have just garden injury or not, or should there be as I say this variety of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6434.717" offset="25842291">Shall the court tamper the rate to the Shaw and Lamb or is the Shaw and Lamb the plaintiff which gets benefits for all the lands and this will present, I believe to the courts rather -- more problems than the Government expects to solve.</text>
            <text syncTime="6461.828" offset="25950647">This then is the anatomy of the argument before us.</text>
            <text syncTime="6467.331" offset="25972694">Before we go into that argument, may I say a few words about the background?</text>
            <text syncTime="6475.568" offset="26005608">This is what my distinguished friend and colleague, Mr. Lovett, argued to the Court this morning and they -- the background is illustrated and by -- what he said and by the map behind me.</text>
            <text syncTime="6489.913" offset="26062973">He pictures the background, how does this struggle, he says the chapter in the struggle in the Tennessee Valley between the barge lines and the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="6500.750" offset="26106337">This -- I -- we shall not discuss, it would seem to me quite unlikely that if this was solely a struggle between two types of carriers, we would have found the interveners in this case that we have both before the Commission and in some cases before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6523.886" offset="26198915">Why for instance would the Southern Governor's Conference or the Departments of Agriculture of the United States, or of North Carolina or Virginia, or Missouri or the American Farm Bureau Federation, or the Georgia Poultry Federation or the Alabama Cattlemen Association, or the Georgia or North Carolina Public Utilities Commission, or the Southeastern Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners or the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commission, why should they intervene before the Commissioners are here if this is only a fact recital route between two carries?</text>
            <text syncTime="6571.152" offset="26387937">I wish to refer to a different background and for a different reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="6575.406" offset="26404968">It is not to say who is sheep and who is wolf, but to say why these rates have been put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6586.933" offset="26451153">The result of the Government's argument and of the petitioners' argument is that at an early stage of the ratemaking process the courts should be injected to do what the Government calls their traditional task of weighing the equities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6607.499" offset="26533386">What I am about to say on the back is to show to Your Honor that it is nothing of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="6614.097" offset="26559718">There is no tradition about what the courts will be doing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6619.088" offset="26579675">This is not the kind of a thing that a court is equipped to do or has done or can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="6626.655" offset="26609977">And why do I say that?</text>
            <text syncTime="6633.323" offset="26636622">Before the Commission, evidence was introduced to show the history of the carriage of grain in the Southeast, into the Southeast over the last five years in regard to which figures were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="6649.336" offset="26700675">The figures which I'm about to state to the Court, I do not wish to represent as absolutely accurate statistical figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="6659.030" offset="26739440">The figures for carriage by rail at water are accurate and complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="6664.494" offset="26761383">The carry -- figures for carriage by truck have been estimated by statistical methods used by the Department of Agriculture and others who were engaged in trying to discover the amount of grain imported by unregulated carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6681.724" offset="26830242">And therefore this is -- there isn't element of estimate about this and the figures can be wrong by say 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="6691.042" offset="26867545">Now, what do these figures show?</text>
            <text syncTime="6694.597" offset="26881755">They show that over the five years from 1955 to 1960, the railroads carried at the beginning 55% of all the grain introduced into the Southeast.</text>
            <text syncTime="6707.299" offset="26932537">At the end of that period they carried 22%, less than half in five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="6714.612" offset="26961795">It showed that the trucks neither did -- that the water carriers in 1955 carried a quarter, 25% of all the grain brought into the Southeast.</text>
            <text syncTime="6725.015" offset="27003382">At the end of the period they carried 21%.</text>
            <text syncTime="6729.986" offset="27023339">Trucks at the beginning of the period carried 20% and at the end they carried 57%, almost three times as much but this Your Honors is only half the story.</text>
            <text syncTime="6745.084" offset="27083734">Between 1955 and 1960, the amount of grain brought into the Southeastern section of the United States tripled.</text>
            <text syncTime="6754.162" offset="27119992">It increased by seven and a third million tons of grain and it is interesting to say who shared in that new business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6764.252" offset="27160430">The new business which was twice as rate as the whole business which existed before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6772.901" offset="27195016">The railroad gained less than half a million tons out of this seven and a third million.</text>
            <text syncTime="6780.660" offset="27226049">The barges gained a million and a third they increased their carriage by 250%.</text>
            <text syncTime="6790.982" offset="27267323">The trucks gained five-and-a-half million tons of grain and as I say, rose from 20 to 57% of the carriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="6802.687" offset="27314134">Now this truck competition, Your Honors, is something new.</text>
            <text syncTime="6806.859" offset="27330853">This is new since the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="6809.353" offset="27340779">This is a new development arising out of the great increase in super highway, the great increase in automobile production which has produced enumerable new trucks which one can buy with a small down payment and the nature of this carriage, this is 99% unregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="6831.885" offset="27430954">These are not great truck lines which are carrying as common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6837.874" offset="27454882">These are small gypsy truckers who carry Southern goods north.</text>
            <text syncTime="6844.122" offset="27479855">They carry fruits, lumber, vegetables, stones of various kinds, marbles, sand stones, whatever it maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="6852.399" offset="27512978">They carry this north and on the back haul they pick up grain and carry this into the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="6859.076" offset="27539728">And usually the owner-driver-operator buys the grain himself and sells it when he gets into the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="6867.319" offset="27572642">And because all he has to do is to pay a little more than the added cost of gasoline for loading his truck, his rate and his profit on the grain are the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6879.229" offset="27620289">Nobody knows what these rates are, there are no rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="6882.270" offset="27632410">These are private treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="6883.919" offset="27639097">Sometimes they're not treaties at all as I have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="6886.550" offset="27649546">He merely buys grain, carries it south and sells it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6894.370" offset="27680893">Much of the barge traffic is wholly unregulated also or you mean to escape from the regulation of the Interstate Commerce Commission by carrying grain by barge is to carry only grain in one tow.</text>
            <text syncTime="6910.401" offset="27744946">This takes you out from under regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6912.729" offset="27754245">Of course if you have a barge made out of something else in, then you are not exempt under default commodity provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6921.061" offset="27787577">And so a great deal of it is done by private carriage also and there are no terms, no rates are fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6930.241" offset="27824358">A great many of the barge lines of whom I believe, although I do not dare assert that the petitioner here is one, are alliances which do not own equipment at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6942.623" offset="27873886">They lease equipment from stockholders who owned the equipment in connection with their own business, such as sand and gravel companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6950.743" offset="27906382">They get the other with other companies and form a barge line.</text>
            <text syncTime="6955.853" offset="27926758">There equipment is used by the barge line and what is rate, what is dividend, what is profit, nobody can ascertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="6966.013" offset="27967404">Therefore, briefly I point that this -- this chart is all based on the basis that published common carrier tariffs are being charged and that at -- because those tariffs are charged, the barge line will go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="6985.237" offset="28044309">So, nothing could be further from the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="6989.845" offset="28062804">There are various rates which were on the end, have been taken off showing a barge rate at Guntersville and then a rail rate to Birmingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="7001.464" offset="28109197">And they said they're -- they've denied proposed rates that so much of that combination of these published common carrier barge rates and the published common carrier truck or rail rates that they would be out of business, but that isn't what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="7016.274" offset="28168443">This is all fanciful.</text>
            <text syncTime="7018.932" offset="28179101">The idea of the -- this super colossal injury is going to take place days upon a series of assumptions which in fact on our proof and in my judgment cannot be proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="7031.746" offset="28230405">But aside from that, what I have been saying to the Court about the background of transportation in the south -- into the Southeast is not an unusual story.</text>
            <text syncTime="7043.480" offset="28277321">This has been coming about, ever since the development of the throughways and the development of the trucks.</text>
            <text syncTime="7050.058" offset="28303653">And it is clear that only drastic innovation by the railways is going to keep the railways alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="7057.729" offset="28334268">If they go on with their conventional rates and a conventional traffic patterns, and their conventional traffic arrangements, the railroads are bound to lose as they have lost here all the new business which a developing economy is bringing about, they are bound to lose that to the truckers and to the barge lines.</text>

            <text syncTime="7658.801" offset="30738578">It means we assert what it says and the language is plain enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="7663.468" offset="30757282">If the proceeding has not been concluded and an order made within the period of suspension, the proposed change of rate shall go into effect at the end of such period.</text>
            <text syncTime="7676.964" offset="30811199">It's the language one would think was played.</text>
            <text syncTime="7680.689" offset="30826141">Mr. Justice Stewart has said, “Perhaps, to make it plainer, it should say positively go into effect.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7688.890" offset="30858951">Perhaps that would make it plainer but not much plain and this, Your Honor presents -- Your Honors presents to a person in my position with the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="7699.805" offset="30902627">How does one argue the obvious?</text>
            <text syncTime="7703.120" offset="30915897">One can only perhaps go on saying it over and over again which would be tiresome and would not help the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7709.615" offset="30941811">But perhaps, one way to argue the obvious is to show what the problem was before the statute went into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="7719.018" offset="30979427">What the Congress was discussing?</text>
            <text syncTime="7721.053" offset="30987577">What the issues were before the Congress?</text>
            <text syncTime="7723.743" offset="30998340">And how the Congress undertook the deal with that problem?</text>
            <text syncTime="7729.155" offset="31019969">Now before the Mann-Elkins Act of 1910, there was they say the very least, the gravest question is to whether the United States courts had any authority to enjoin these rates while the Commission was investigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="7748.524" offset="31097501">Mr. Chief Justice Hughes thought they had no power to do this at all but I think it's irrelevant to hear whether they had it or whether there was great doubt about it, certainly there was the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="7761.740" offset="31150373">In 1910, the Congress intervened into this, into this situation and it authorized the Commission to suspend rates and only the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7773.950" offset="31199169">There is not a word in the statute to indicate that it was granting authority, if authority did not exist that it was granting authority to the United States courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="7785.364" offset="31244831">There's not a word of that sort there.</text>
            <text syncTime="7788.171" offset="31256012">There is not a word of any sort except desultory statements by various members of Congress during debate as to whether they were considering the question of granting.</text>
            <text syncTime="7801.517" offset="31309406">This question was not issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="7803.067" offset="31315675">It was not before the Congress at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="7806.913" offset="31331035">The bill proposed, the Committee has proposed, everyone discussed giving this power to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="7814.510" offset="31361442">Not a soul proposed except Senator La Follette that it should be given to anyone else and Senator La Follette's proposal as you have heard was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="7827.754" offset="31414418">The issue which was discussed was a real issue and in this issue the sides were pretty well formed between the progressives, the insurgent, Republicans on one side and the more conservative members of the Congress on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="7848.012" offset="31495398">And this issue was, shall we take away from the railroads their prior power, shall we take completely away from the railroads their prior power to put rates into effect first and litigate them afterwards or, shall we say that after a reasonable chance has been given for the Commission to look into these rates, we will divide the irreparable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="7874.248" offset="31600410">Everybody knew there was going to be irreparable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="7877.052" offset="31611591">The railways are irreparably injured if they are committed to collect lawful rates, other people maybe irreparably injured, even though they have actions at law if the railroads do collect rates which are later held to be unlawful, shall we divide this by dividing the time that the rates shall be in suspension?</text>
            <text syncTime="7899.339" offset="31700720">Now this was the argument before the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="7902.195" offset="31712110">This is what they discussed and in the Act of 1910, this battle went back and forth and the legislative history is all directed to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="7917.593" offset="31773759">And you see first of all the insurgents putting in amendments which would say no rate is lawful until the Commission has said it's lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="7926.378" offset="31808867">These were defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="7928.997" offset="31819316">Then the stalwarts begin to offer concessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7932.786" offset="31834467">They at first said, “Two months suspension.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7935.758" offset="31846379">Then they said, “Well, we're going to double that, four months suspension” and the insurgents had enough votes to beat that off.</text>
            <text syncTime="7942.339" offset="31872711">And finally, you -- there was a compromise made by saying the Commission may suspend for four months, but if that isn't enough time they may have six months more, but the principle was established that there should be an end at some not, an end fixed by Congress of the period of suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="7967.298" offset="31972603">In the Transportation Act of 1920, this period of ten months, four months plus six months were shortened to five months.</text>
            <text syncTime="7977.236" offset="32012309">Now, five months proved to be too short.</text>
            <text syncTime="7979.958" offset="32023176">In the Act of 1927, the period was then extended to one lump sum of -- one long period of seven months.</text>
            <text syncTime="7996.197" offset="32088168">But I suggest that reason box at the thought that all of this debate, all of this struggle between intelligent, earnest, convinced men was only a pillow fight that there was no reality in it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="8015.205" offset="32164237">Because these men were so stupid that they did not know unbeknownst to them whatever period they might agree on that the Commission should suspend that they were giving power to the courts to step in afterwards and continue the suspension until the Commission should decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="8037.785" offset="32254516">This I think denigrates men who are worthy of better treatment admits.</text>
            <text syncTime="8043.886" offset="32278967">These men thought they were fighting and indeed they were fighting about a principle and about a real issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="8050.280" offset="32304462">Can you say that they weren't at all -- that was all a lot of foolish business back and forth is to how long the Commission should be able to suspend where the courts always lurking in the background, able to complete the suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="8067.714" offset="32374262">This I think is completely to abnegate history.</text>
            <text syncTime="8072.899" offset="32394951">There aren't many occasions as clear as this, if the Court please, where a very considerable battle appears clearly on the page of statute, here it is, right on the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="8086.896" offset="32450957">I know of only -- of the -- one other case where it's as clear as this which is not without its illustrated interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="8094.247" offset="32480319">Sir John Neil talks about the first Elizabeth's battle with the Congress and with the Parliament of 1559 on the issue of the British prayer book.</text>
            <text syncTime="8106.997" offset="32531310">This was a battle which nearly upset the Tudor regime in England and it was compromised around a colony.</text>
            <text syncTime="8115.760" offset="32566418">It's compromised in that part of the preamble in the Eucharist, in the double sentences separated by a colon in which the bread and wine are administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="8126.881" offset="32610931">Sir John points out that the first one of these sentences is the prayer book of Panama, the Catholic doctrine, the real presence then at the end is a colon.</text>
            <text syncTime="8138.141" offset="32655966">The second sentence is Swiss Reformation Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="8142.664" offset="32674043">These two about which the Queen and the Divines were battling were put together and separated by a comma and here in that one page of the prayer book, you'll find the great issue of the early days of Queen Elizabeth, an issue which might have divided England and overthrown the Queen, here it is now unnoticed by anybody because it's sanctified by centuries of usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="8170.619" offset="32785847">So it's true here, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="8173.431" offset="32797132">On this statute, in which my learned friend says all he can conclude is that the Congress wished to toss this question into the lap of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8184.516" offset="32841435">Nothing is further from the historical fact in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="8188.542" offset="32857527">That Congress had no idea of tossing this issue into the lap of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="8193.789" offset="32878529">It had every thought it was deciding it itself and deciding it after a tremendous battle and there, the Act of 1910 is an issue of a great battle in the Congress over this very question.</text>

            <text syncTime="8241.654" offset="33069955">Your Honor, may I reply at a little length into that question?</text>
            <text syncTime="8247.849" offset="33094719">This general matter is discussed in the statute, and it says that a three-judge court created after an order of the Commission and only a three-judge court has authority to issue interlocutory or final orders, a final injunction regarding orders of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="8268.787" offset="33178520">Its jurisdiction relates to orders of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="8273.406" offset="33197014">Obviously, under that statute it can issue a temporary restraining order, interlocutory injunction or any other kind of injunction against an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="8284.764" offset="33242467">Now, orders of the Commission have different effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="8291.936" offset="33271097">An order of the Commission saying these rates are illegal makes these rates illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="8298.250" offset="33296384">Therefore, the Court enjoins that down the -- the injunction is lifted.</text>
            <text syncTime="8307.465" offset="33333269">They do no along this -- I mean the order is lifted, they do no longer -- if however, the order of the Commission says these rates are lawful, the rates are in effect and lawfully in effect under the 15 (7), the Commission nearly confirms what was true anyway, and does not make the rates unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="8329.734" offset="33422294">Therefore, strictly answering your question on a purely logical statutory basis, the answer to your question is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="8337.688" offset="33454164">They do not have and are not given the authority to enjoin rates but only order the Commission, but that really doesn't answer your -- to your question because it all depends what the Commission does and what the courts do.</text>
            <text syncTime="8353.010" offset="33515395">If the court issues an order saying that we for various reasons want to enjoin your order and we think that you've omitted something or you've taken a wrong view and therefore, we order you or ask you or direct you to set aside -- have a new hearing on these rates then, the Commission will start doing something which will put the railroad in a wholly different position.</text>
            <text syncTime="8381.031" offset="33627512">And if the railroad is then told by the Court of Appeals that it has views which are very likely put the railroad in serious trouble if it goes ahead, it is quite likely not to go ahead for the Commission may take it up with the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="8395.660" offset="33686026">There's a great -- this is not done really on a strictly -- on its length basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="8401.669" offset="33710059">The railroad must look out for what it sees ahead of itself, and the Commission has great power to tell the railroad that it would be wise if it filed a new tariff not putting this in effect until after its final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="8414.404" offset="33760946">That is about the way this thing works.</text>
            <text syncTime="8431.799" offset="33830536">Now, Your Honors if I may go on a little longer, the petitioner's argument is one which I think is quite easy to understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="8448.280" offset="33896469">The Government's argument, I've already pointed out, presents grave difficulties as to the framing of the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="8459.435" offset="33941086">The Government's argument also presents grave difficulties as to the statement of the rule which it is urging upon this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8471.527" offset="33989465">It's already been pointed out by Justice Goldberg that this is a -- of novel standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="8478.546" offset="34017573">This is a standard that we are not familiar with in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="8482.508" offset="34033455">This is not a standard of irreparable injury, one of some kind of additional injury, where does this come from.</text>
            <text syncTime="8490.732" offset="34066265">There's no indication that anybody in the Congress was ever thinking of any such idea as this at any time during the debate on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="8501.486" offset="34109315">This is not a distillation of congressional thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="8508.057" offset="34135646">As I say there's nothing in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="8510.498" offset="34145364">There's nothing in the history of equitable remedy which indicates this super, super standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="8518.062" offset="34175666">In order to state this, what I think almost defy legal draftsmanship, I wouldn't know if I were asked to amend the statute to bring into it with the idea given us by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="8534.824" offset="34242644">I wouldn't know how to go about this drafting job.</text>
            <text syncTime="8538.255" offset="34256436">It would be a complete rewriting of the statute, but then the Government says it is not shown that in determining the language which Congress adopted, it foresaw the sort of injury that the Government is talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="8561.551" offset="34349537">This I submit to the Court is a new type of legislative history and use.</text>
            <text syncTime="8568.245" offset="34376391">It is true that when a language of the Congress is absolutely clear and there's no doubt about the fact that Congress meant just what it said that anyone can show 50 years later that a case comes along which the Congress did not foresee when it used this plain language, that the plain language must be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="8589.195" offset="34460191">I have never heard of legislative history being used in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="8594.818" offset="34482657">The language is plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="8596.636" offset="34489866">It does not permit this error.</text>
            <text syncTime="8598.926" offset="34499062">There's no evidence that anyone ever considered this standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="8605.993" offset="34527378">In other words, a standard made out of thin air is now introduced to deal with what is taught to be a particular case and the only thing that I think this effort the Government attributes to this case is to underline the error of the petitioner's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="8633.523" offset="34637511">Both -- may I pass to another point about the petitioner and the Government in their briefs?</text>
            <text syncTime="8641.078" offset="34667708">Refer to Section 22 of the Interstate Commerce Act, which preserved common law remedies when this common law remedies are not inconsistent with the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="8652.614" offset="34713788">Now, neither the Government nor the petitioners spell out what they mean by this and indeed I'm not able to spell it out either because we have already pointed out that there is no suit at common law by someone alleging injury from a rate which is too low.</text>
            <text syncTime="8672.250" offset="34792364">Common law remedies are against rates which are too high or discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="8676.827" offset="34810650">The thrust of this case is clearly that the rates are too low.</text>
            <text syncTime="8682.587" offset="34833742">If it is said that the rates are discriminatory, then I answer that there is nothing in the Commission's finding about discrimination at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="8692.282" offset="34872508">It deals only about unjust and unlawful rates which means the rate is too high or rates which contravene the National Transportation Policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="8722.230" offset="34992253">There is one other idea which is related in a way to what Mr. Justice Stewart asked me a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="8733.575" offset="35037706">In both the Government and the petitioner's brief or probably in the Government's brief, there are two suggestions that the intervention of the courts is necessary to preserve, I use this word, to preserve or to make effective, the judgment first of the Commission or then of a three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8755.901" offset="35126941">Is it different from what Mr. Justice Stewart asked me a moment ago?</text>
            <text syncTime="8760.822" offset="35146689">In the Government's brief on page 19 to 20 they say, “After these allegations are legit, the barge lines are driven out of business before the Commission could rule upon the lawfulness of the rates, the Commission will be rendered powerless to grab effective relief or to carry out the declared policy of Congress and the outcome of a bitterly contested economic controversy in which an important public interest is at stake will be determined not by the responsible agency applying a statutory criterion but by the force of circumstances.”</text>
            <text syncTime="8795.847" offset="35286810">Now, I submit to this Court that nothing of that sort is even remotely possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="8802.197" offset="35312201">The Commission is not rendered ineffective nor is it -- its judgment rendered ineffective depending upon the economic situation of certain plaintiffs before a District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="8816.102" offset="35367790">There are vast interests before the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="8822.201" offset="35392136">Its order will be effective when rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="8825.291" offset="35404570">There's no danger of circumstances and not the Commission deciding this case.</text>
