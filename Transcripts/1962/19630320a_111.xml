            <text syncTime="20.219" offset="185323">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.055" offset="204654">This case involves the constitutionality of a Kansas Statute making it a misdemeanor to engage in the business of debt adjusting for a fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.300" offset="261601">Statute has a proviso that the provisions of this act shall not apply to those situations involving debt adjusting as herein defined, incurred incidentally in the lawful practice of law in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.336" offset="329728">I might say to the court that debt adjusting is an activity, a business activity wherein the debtor turns the portion of his earnings over to the debt adjustor and is usually as a result of solicitation by advertising or some other means.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.922" offset="396079">Then the adjustor distributes to the creditors of the debtor who will agree to the plan and the adjustor charges a fee and it is usually based upon the total amount of the debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.287" offset="445503">Now this is a criminal statute, misdemeanor, and the statute does not affect those that charge no fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.402" offset="486045">This case was brought in the Federal District Court, in the District of Kansas asking for an injunction and for declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.247" offset="525333">Action was brought against the Sedgwick County, county attorney and the Attorney General State of Kansas as Defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.155" offset="556993">Temporary restraining orders were issued and then there was an order for three-judge court.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.098" offset="576742">The Wichita Bar Association filed an application to intervene on behalf of the state and it was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.885" offset="603909">There was a hearing and then a decision by the three-judge court, two-to-one, Judge Stanley dissenting, declared that the law violated due process and is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.899" offset="663991">I call the Court's attention to the decision, it's found on page 126 of the transcript, the court below said that the grounds upon which this action is predicated or that the act is void because it violates and infringes Plaintiff's rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.127" offset="760853">The Court in its conclusion of law concluded that, the act in question is prohibitory and not regulatory, but went on to say that even if it's construed as regulatory, it is unreasonable, unwarranted regulation of a lawful businesses and therefore constitutes a violation of the rights claimed as guaranteed by Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.278" offset="857506">The only question here involves measuring of this statute against the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="252.644" offset="1114969">Yes, but Georgia is almost precisely like this in the same language.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.755" offset="1135449">Massachusetts involves -- the practice of law makes -- the fact makes it a practice of law in due debt adjusting, so does Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.105" offset="1172856">The New Jersey Statute is very similar to this one except that they spell out a few exceptions, but generally speaking the statutes are quite similar in all the states that prohibit, in the seven states that regulated there is a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.662" offset="1247044">The Court then said that, the lower Court that we are in full accord with the reasoning and philosophy of the Pennsylvania Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.392" offset="1274002">What they were referring to there was Commonwealth versus Stone, which struck down a very similar statute upon the authority of Adams versus Tanner and of course the Court is quiet familiar with Adams versus Tanner, the Landmark Case of those cases involving substantive or commercial due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.743" offset="1375357">Now the Court below however recognized that there was an evil in this particular activity in saying that debt adjustment is by its very nature may lend itself to great abuses and because of this the state has power to regulate it, that the -- and that its citizens may not be over reached by unscrupulous persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.369" offset="1457904">Then the Court holds, we conclude first that the act is prohibitory and not regulatory and that it prohibits anyone from engaging in the business of debt adjustment, but even if the exception is considered as regulatory it is an unreasonable regulation of lawful business.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.706" offset="1531256">Then the Court turns its attention to the exception involved with respect to lawyers and said this, “to say that the lawyer may adjust the debt solely as an incident to a case, which is otherwise before him is most unreasonable and the state of Kansas appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.448" offset="1598234">Now, there are -- is just one basic primary question here and that is whether or not this Court is going to return to it's -- the old philosophy of commercial or substantive due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.334" offset="1665735">There is a secondary question which I will discuss because it was so strongly urged by the appellee and that's the question of the affect of the title of this particular act as measured by the Kansas Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.706" offset="1719233">We feel there is no particular significance, but I'll discuss it if time allows.</text>

            <text syncTime="427.542" offset="1814528">The act was regularly adapted, there is no question of notice, there is no matter of vagueness, there is no violation of First Amendment guarantees, there is no invasion of the individual liberties.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.381" offset="1861966">It's simply a question as to whether or not the Court is exercising its proper function when it measures its particular idea of legislation against that as a legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.410" offset="1926019">In other words, the Court in this situation substitutes -- substituted its judgment for that of the Kansas Legislature and doing so followed the Tanner case, 1916 case, where the Court in that case said that the Fourteenth Amendment proscribed the state of Washington from prohibiting, charging the fee in what the Court there found to be a lawful business, namely obtaining employment for a fee and as I had pointed out, the Tanner case is just among a number of cases that up until the middle 1930's was used by the Court to strike down enactments of the various state legislatures and of the Congress for reason that measured against the Fourteenth Amendment the Court found that it was unreasonable and struck them down.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.294" offset="2169584">Among those cases of course were Lochner case, striking down maximum hours, Coppage versus Kansas, striking down the Yellow-dog contracts, Wolff Packing Company case, striking down the authority to fix wages in hours, yhe Lehman case on prices, and in our own state there is still some residue of the old doctrine of substantive due process, I might as well face up to it, Gilbert versus Matthews, which is very strongly relied upon by the appellee here.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.111" offset="2308869">There is -- the Kansas Court there struck down a new goods auction law on the ground that it was unduly restrictive, and although I might point out to the Court that in that case there were some other matters including notice, and dual regulations, and unreasonable classifications and so on.</text>

            <text syncTime="3532.573" offset="14234708">I just point out that the State of Kansas could have regulated this activity, but it chose not to regulate it, it chose to prohibit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.082" offset="14272742">And it doesn't seem to me that there is any magic in the fact State of Massachusetts, which has almost exactly the same kind of a law, says that it shall be deemed to be the practice of a law within the provisions of Section 46 of the Massachusetts Act, that this would make it good to do it the way we did it would make it fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.461" offset="14346198">Of course this Court is fully familiar with the Bird case, Daniel case where this particular Court has held that the state may, if it wishes prohibit an otherwise lawful activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3595.759" offset="14487468">Both of these cases we feel were wrong, in as much as they were adopting the principle of substantive due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.826" offset="14515681">But the Mathews case in Kansas doesn't necessarily mean that it's gone so far as to say that Tanner is completely alive in Kansas and would govern this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.047" offset="14564582">I don't think we can assume here that this case, this statute would be a violation of the Kansas Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3636.949" offset="14652144">This Court has said in the Sage case that they aren't the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="3652.992" offset="14716406">And in the Sage case this Court upheld the legislature of Kansas' determination to prohibit filled milk, and in that case it took up the argument equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.671" offset="14771054">And it said that there is no difference between equal protection here and due process here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.608" offset="14790802">We don't measure business activity against the Fourteenth Amendment anymore and that's in sum and substance of what is being tried to do here.</text>
