            <text syncTime="28.405" offset="217004">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.692" offset="234141">Yesterday before the recess, I had sought to establish two facts which I believe must be considered during the study of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.858" offset="286804">First of all, the statement of the confederate, Boblit, contains nothing, which would exculpate Brady from guilt of first-degree murder under the Maryland felony murder statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.279" offset="356498">It merely contains the assertion or the admission that Boblit himself actually strangled the victim, but it places Brady at the scene of the crime as the man who knew Brooks, as the man who said, “We have got to kill Brooks,” as the man who said “We've have got to strangle Brooks.”</text>
            <text syncTime="85.278" offset="444479">Secondly, the attorney representing John Brady determined before the trial even began that the real issue in the trial was not guilt or innocence, but penalty for murder in the first-degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.629" offset="525876">In other words, he sought to persuade the jury to bring in a verdict of guilty of first-degree murder without capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.241" offset="572374">Now, at the trial of the case, Brady took the stand and again Brady admitted as he had in his statements, which he had given to the police prior to his trial, he again admitted he had participated in the robbery, but denied he had actually committed the homicide.</text>

            <text syncTime="176.969" offset="811238">The closing argument or at least the -- the closing argument to the jury by a counsel for Brady consisted of a confession of guilt of first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.550" offset="873618">Now when Brady again went to court himself to testify at the post-conviction hearing before the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, he again admitted his guilt of first degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.247" offset="956374">He admitted that he was there and he participated in the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.657" offset="969958">He admitted the facts which constitute first-degree murder on the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.636" offset="1169951">But at any rate this point was brought up at the post-conviction hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.155" offset="1200044">Now throughout the other proceedings in this case, it had never been controverted that Brady has always admitted his presence at the trial -- at the robbery and his participation in the robbery and I think it is also important to remember that there was a judicial confession in effect at his trial when Brady admitted his presence and his participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.450" offset="1329194">Now, in view of these facts and the fact that the Court of Appeals in its opinion states that nothing in -- well, this withheld confession this appears on page 52 of the record, nothing in it could have reduced the appellant Brady's offense below murder in the first degree.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.592" offset="1441729">May, I ask you just one more thing before you get into another phase of the case?</text>
            <text syncTime="341.220" offset="1468270">On page 26, item 25 that we talked about yesterday somewhat, would you mind telling me when that statement was made by counsel for the defendant and in want context please?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas W. Jamison, III</label>
            <text syncTime="359.744" offset="1542353">It was made prior to the trial at a conference in the judge's chambers with counsel for a coconspirator or the confederate and they were discussing various aspects such as we have a jury trial, which defendant will be tried first and so forth and at that time, Counsel for Brady said that his trial would be limited to penalty for murder in the first-degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.475" offset="1661262">Now, in Maryland, the Constitution provides that the jury is the judge of the law as well as the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.254" offset="1724374">This provision has been in the Constitution of Maryland at least since 1867 I think and to my knowledge has never been applied in exactly the way it is sought to be applied in this case, but the Court of Appeals of Maryland in a recent case, Giles versus State said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.334" offset="1836701">“It is the duty of a jury to decide a case according to the established rules of law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="443.611" offset="1877765">In all frankness, I must admit that this statement was made from the other side of the coin, dealing the duty of the jury from the standpoint of the defendant other than the standpoint of the State, but I respectfully submit that the duty of the jury is the same whether it acquits the defendant or convicts him, it is nevertheless the duty of a jury to decide the case according to the established rules of the law, in spite of this constitutional provision.</text>

It maybe that when the constitutional prevision was enacted, the idea was to give a great scope of authority to the jury, but I believe that in view of the two recent cases, the Giles case and the Brady case, the Court of Appeals has indicated that it feels there was a very limited scope to this provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1576.681" offset="6410115">And there was an objection to him explaining the law and it was overruled and the witness, the counsel went on and said and both of them were in fact committing a felony, they were charged each with a greater offense and one of them committing murder which everyone of them -- it was -- would be, would automatically charge the other one with murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="1715.901" offset="6966941">And so he chose rather than to put both these issues to the jury, he made a tactic, he made a choice of strategy and he decided instead of putting both these issues to the jury and maybe angering them, because I don't have very much to say about this guilt thing, I am going spread the cards on the table and I am just going to go hard on this issue of mercy and on the question of the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.324" offset="7064639">But that's a choice that he made after he had been overreached by the state and as much as that is speculation, so I would have to speculate to say to you how the trial would have deferred, if before the trial began he had that fifth statement where the man -- you see at this point this is a statement made when the man knows that the other man is in custody and when he is told by the police that there are some discrepancies in what you said before and he comes -- he changes the story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.731" offset="7194311">Now he doesn't change it so far as to exonerate this man, but where might further interrogation of him by the police led, where might it have led further interrogation and investigation and a testimony of the trial by counsel for Brady, this is speculation, I don't know.</text>
