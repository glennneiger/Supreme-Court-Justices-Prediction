            <text syncTime="51.538" offset="310502">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.232" offset="341326">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.030" offset="380510">In issuing the writ of certiorari, this Court expressly requested counsel to discuss the following question: should this Court's holding in Betts versus Brady, 316 U.S. 455, be reconsidered?</text>
            <text syncTime="96.588" offset="490747">The question, of course, is the right of accused in State criminal proceedings to the appointment of counsel, specifically in the present case which you have before you, the question is an exceedingly narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.742" offset="603387">The question in the present case is whether requests being made by the accused that counsel be appointed to him, the accused being concededly indigent, it is the duty of the State to accede to that request and to appoint counsel as a -- for purposes of assisting the accused in the trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.605" offset="750822">In other words, the present case involves a trial, a plea of not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.798" offset="783632">It involves a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.914" offset="796066">And that is the narrow question that this case presents.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.676" offset="831070">Clarence Earl Gideon was convicted by the State of Florida for the violation of a statute which makes it a felony, unlawfully and feloniously, to break and enter a building of another with intent to commit a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.128" offset="964921">He was charged with breaking and entering the Pearl -- the Bay Harbor Poolroom in the city -- in Panama City, Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.825" offset="1023645">And having broken and entered that poolroom, he is charged with having extracted some wine, perhaps some cigarettes, and a sum of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.778" offset="1083517">There is no evidence in the record as to the amount, but the amount must have been less than $100 because the statute of the State of Florida defines petty larceny as the taking of goods or money in an amount less than $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.699" offset="1191142">At the commencement of the trial, the Court asked Clarence Earl Gideon if he was ready to proceed, he said he was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.326" offset="1233669">He said he was not because he was without funds and without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.723" offset="1279331">And he asked the Court to appoint counsel to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.887" offset="1307961">As you will see on page 2 of the petitioner's brief, the Court replied that he could not appoint counsel to represent a defendant in a noncapital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.225" offset="1385284">Whereupon, the case proceeded to trial, with Clarence Earl Gideon doing what he could --</text>

            <text syncTime="365.501" offset="1566365">Namely, that petitioner was without funds and without an attorney at the time of trial, that he requested the appointment of counsel and that the trial court failed to appoint counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="384.796" offset="1643583">That is -- that is my view, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.832" offset="1655704">I must say, Your Honor, that it was at my request.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.439" offset="1674198">The transcript was not before the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.021" offset="1688513">I was coming to that in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.095" offset="1696768">After Gideon -- and let me state it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.561" offset="1710665">After Gideon was convicted and sentenced, several months later he sent a petition for a writ of habeas corpus to the State of -- to the Supreme Court of the State of Florida, which appears in this transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.717" offset="1779315">That petition cited no special circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.163" offset="1797078">It made the bald, bare claim that Gideon was entitled to counsel as a constitutional matter and that the trial court refused to appoint counsel for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.453" offset="1858205">And on that basis, Gideon asked that he be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.703" offset="1879207">The Supreme Court -- there were no supporting affidavits, there was no supporting information, and there was no supporting trial transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.486" offset="1910345">Gideon -- the Supreme Court of Florida denied the writ and dismissed the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.052" offset="1956634">And they dismissed it without opinion without hearing or without reference for the taking of testimony whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.639" offset="1986936">And it's from that denial that the case is here on Gideon's application, pro se, for a writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.089" offset="2028732">Accordingly, the record before the Supreme Court of Florida consists of nothing except Gideon's old application for a writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.331" offset="2081708">After the case came to this Court and this Court granted the writ of certiorari and I as counsel for Mr. Gideon, requested the clerk of this Court to ask the Florida trial court to certify the transcript here.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.232" offset="2169375">I did that because I thought that the transcript should be here, that the Court should be -- this Court should be completely informed as to what had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.836" offset="2219739">That the Attorney General of Florida filed a motion to deny my request that the transcript be sent to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.198" offset="2269163">That motion was -- the Attorney General's opposition was turned down by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.218" offset="2297271">My motion was granted and the transcript was sent up from the trial court directly to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.655" offset="2327050">The Attorney General of Florida now takes the position that the transcript is not properly before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.940" offset="2356203">We disagree, but for reasons that I shall come to, we do not believe that makes any difference whether the transcript is here or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.225" offset="2389326">We believe that Betts against Brady is properly raised in this case and must unavoidably be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.507" offset="2426420">The reason for that is that I see no basis, or as -- I do not see an adequate basis for an argument that special circumstances exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.346" offset="2489741">And I will come to that in more length in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.390" offset="2505937">Let me say this, if the Court please, if you will look at this transcript of the record, perhaps you will share my feeling, which is a feeling of despondency.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.450" offset="2578244">This record is not -- does not indicate that Clarence Earl Gideon is a man of inferior natural talents.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.361" offset="2617846">This record does not indicate that Clarence Earl Gideon is a moron or a person of low intelligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.972" offset="2660268">This record does not indicate that the judge of the trial court in the State of Florida, or that the prosecuting attorney in the State of Florida, was derelict in his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.184" offset="2721081">On the contrary, it indicates that they tried to help Gideon.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.606" offset="2738845">But to me, if the Court please, this record indicates the basic difficulty with Betts against Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.605" offset="2782835">And the basic difficulty with Betts against Brady is that no man, certainly no layman, can conduct a trial in his own defense so that the trial is a fair trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="709.625" offset="2942913">Do you -- are you suggesting, Mr. Justice Harlan, which I believe to be the case, that the real basis for Betts against Brady is the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.528" offset="2990456">That a man does not get a fair trial if he does -- is not represented by a lawyer, but that the demands of federalism overweigh the absence of a fair trial.</text>

            <label>Mr. Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="737.612" offset="3054822">I read it as indicating both, but of course, we must remember in reading Betts against Brady that Betts against Brady was involved a trial before a very distinguished jurist, Judge Bond of Maryland, and it did not involve a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.789" offset="3119501">But it's interesting after all these years, Mr. Justice Harlan, to read the recent article by Professor Kamisar of the University of Minnesota in which even in Betts against Brady, even in that case, trial to -- tried to a judge alone and not to a jury, and tried before a very distinguished judge, the record -- the record, the transcript of record, as Professor Kamisar shows, is replete with error.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.433" offset="3242172">And the case that he makes is an entirely convincing case to me, just as in Gideon's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.150" offset="3269026">There's -- there is error in this transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.026" offset="3280520">There is error in most criminal trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.754" offset="3291387">I think we all know even where lawyers are present.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.265" offset="3305493">There is error in this transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.613" offset="3314897">But I have suggested in my brief and I hope it's not a gross overstatement that -- to say that this transcript distinguishes this case from the run of criminal trials is like trying to distinguish between Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.751" offset="3403400">And I believe that -- I believe that this case dramatically illustrates the point that you cannot have a fair trial without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.687" offset="3451152">Indeed, I believe that the right way to look at this, if I may put it that way, is that a court, a criminal court is not properly constituted, and this has been said in some of your own opinions under our adversary system of law, unless there is a judge, and unless there is a counsel for the prosecution, and unless there is a counsel for the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.950" offset="3572151">Without that, how can a civilized nation pretend that it is having a fair trial under our adversary system, which means that counsel for the State will do his best within the limits of fairness and honor and decency to present the case for the State and counsel for the defense will do his best similarly to present the best case possible for the defendant and from that clash there will emerge the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.387" offset="3729930">That is our concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.311" offset="3737663">And how can we say?</text>
            <text syncTime="910.901" offset="3748007">How can it be suggested that a court is properly constituted, that a trial is fair, unless those conditions exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="1093.408" offset="4478077">We start with the proposition that the Fourteenth Amendment requires a fair trial and we say that the defendant in a criminal proceeding cannot get a fair trial unless he has counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1115.862" offset="4567834">But I -- I think I maybe wrong about this, but I do believe that in some of this Court's decisions, there has been a tendency from time to time because of the pull of federalism to forget -- to forget the realities of what happens downstairs, of what happens with these -- to these poor, miserable, indigent people when they are arrested and they are brought into the jail, and they are questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.519" offset="4762499">And later on, they are brought in these strange and awesome circumstances before a magistrate, and then later on they are brought before a court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1217.023" offset="4972523">I was reminded the other day as I was pondering this case about Clarence Darrow's trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.925" offset="5016095">Court will remember that Clarence Darrow was accused, subsequently acquitted of attempting to bribe jurors and subordination of perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.170" offset="5057055">And I looked at Irving Stone's book.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.204" offset="5073251">Irving Stone's book says that the first thing that Clarence Darrow realized was that he had to have a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.699" offset="5107210">He was a man who, by our folklore anyway, and I think perhaps really was our greatest criminal lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.955" offset="5140229">He needed a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.636" offset="5146917">He got a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.735" offset="5155380">He was eventually acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.126" offset="5164889">But I think that in some of the Court's opinions, if I may say so, Mr. Justice Harlan, this element, this failure to remember what happens downstairs, has crept in not because of an insensitivity of the judges, but because of the understandable pull of the sensitivity about the State's own jurisdiction and I want -- that's what I want to analyze.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.770" offset="5295501">That I don't think that it's -- that it stands a test of logic and I don't think that the argument of federalism here is either correct or soundly founded or stands the test of experience, and that's what I want to come to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1333.347" offset="5437816">I meant that a regard which I myself share for the principles of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.800" offset="5467596">But I believe that those principles are misapplied here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.583" offset="5486717">First, they are misapplied, if I may respectfully say so, when they are used for the purpose of negating a Fourteenth Amendment right to a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.901" offset="5543978">Secondly, they are misapplied here because a true regard, in my judgment, Mr. Justice Harlan for federalism here means that this Court will lay down a principle, will establish a principle, and that this Court will not exercise the kind of minute, detailed, ex post facto supervision over state court trials that you have been exercising for these past years, in which in my opinion, is the most corrosive possible way to administer our federal state system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.564" offset="5738642">And that, it is I -- -- I should like to restate that very simply and very plainly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.034" offset="5772497">I believe that Betts against Brady does not incorporate a proper regard for federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.225" offset="5821294">I believe that Betts against Brady laying down as it does a prin -- the principle of case by case supervision by the federal courts of state criminal proceedings is antithetical to federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.781" offset="5923485">Federalism requires, in my judgment, if Your Honors please, that the federal courts should refrain, so far as possible, from intervention in state criminal proceedings and certainly at where intervention is necessary because of a constitutional principle that that intervention should be exercised in the least corrosive, the least aggressive fashion possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.734" offset="6075308">Now let's take a look at that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.798" offset="6087638">In the Betts against Brady, we have to start back with that magnificent opinion, magnificent decision and opinion of this Court written by Mr. Justice Sutherland in Powell against Alabama, and the Scottsboro case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.520" offset="6162453">When Mr. Justice Sutherland's opinion makes it perfectly clear that the correct principle in capital cases is that a state court cannot conduct a criminal proceeding without providing counsel for the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.526" offset="6250538">Now, this Court has said that that is a flat rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.149" offset="6269032">That in capital cases, this Court does not stop to inquire whether there are special circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.106" offset="6300797">Counsel must be appointed for the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.323" offset="6321695">That was in 1932.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.797" offset="6339563">In 1938, along came Johnson against Zerbst, in which this Court construed the Sixth Amendment to require the appointment of counsel for indigent accused in all federal criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.688" offset="6419184">Then in 1942, Betts against Brady came to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.335" offset="6453770">And in Betts against Brady, this Court in an opinion by Mr. Justice Roberts held that the Fourteenth Amendment would not be construed to require that the State's appoint counsel for the accused in all criminal cases where the accused is not able to afford counsel, but that counsel would be required as part of the Fourteenth Amendment's requirement of a fair trial only where there were special circumstances or to quote the Court's words, “Only where there has been a denial of fundamental fairness shocking to the universal sense of justice”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.774" offset="6675498">Which according to the Court, required something more than the mere absence of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.267" offset="6705486">Alright, what has happened in the years since Betts against Brady?</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.408" offset="6742058">I have read, I think, I'm sure I've read all of the cases that have come to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.764" offset="6767449">I've read a great many of the State cases and the lower federal court cases, many as I could find.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.041" offset="6792526">It is a fascinating inquiry, a fascinating inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.787" offset="6815514">In the brief filed by the American Civil Liberties Union here, which is represented by my Brother, Mr. Rankin, they have examined 139 State cases, reported cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.611" offset="6866819">They say that they have found only 11 cases in which the State Appellate Courts found special circumstances under Betts against Brady, contrast that with what's happened in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.971" offset="6956262">Take a look as -- I beg your pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.741" offset="6971308">When I have -- as I have read the opinions of this Court, I hope I maybe forgiven for saying that my heart has been full of compassion for the judges who during these years have had to review and pass on these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.558" offset="7078619">Most of the time, of course, this Court has said there are special circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.407" offset="7105996">Sometimes, a majority of this Court, usually a bare majority, has found that there were not special circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1809.712" offset="7343292">A defendant is arraigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.625" offset="7354890">How can a judge, looking at the defendant, decide whether there are special circumstances in his case?Does a judge look at this defendant and say, “You look stupid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.858" offset="7407867">You look as if you are a moron.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.149" offset="7416957">Does he have a -- does he have a mental examination of him at the time?</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.237" offset="7437333">Does the judge -- does the judge or the magistrate before whom these defendants are arraigned on a typical day in court take a look at the crimes with which they are charged and say, “Now this one involves complicated questions of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.533" offset="7498564">So I think that at the trial you're going to need a counsel.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.512" offset="7510476">Now in your case, the crime that you're charged with doesn't look to me to be so complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.862" offset="7531896">So I don't think you're going to need counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.072" offset="7548719">Now let's have arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.980" offset="7556347">Then you go to trial and the defendant -- the accused man has pleaded not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.800" offset="7583619">And the judge who's sitting on the bench, he's hearing a lot of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.511" offset="7602427">How is he going to decide at the beginning of the case whether there are special circumstances within the criteria laid down by this Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.361" offset="7641819">The interesting thing too, according to the study made by the American Civil Liberties Union, they have not encountered a single case in the state courts in which the trial has been stopped in midstream and the Court has said, “There are special circumstances here and you better have a lawyer, because it looks to me that you're not brighter than Clarence Darrow, or you're a moron and you can't really defend yourself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2328.099" offset="9416788">Now I should say that presently in addition to the 37 states that require the appointment of counsel for indigents by a statute or court rule, a recent study, a very careful study by a Professor Kamisar, shows that there are eight states that require that do appoint counsel when requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.607" offset="9546773">That makes a total of 45 states that appoint counsel either by a statute, court rule or by practice, and it really leaves only five states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.467" offset="9602257">And of those five states -- those five states are Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.026" offset="9632455">And even in Florida, from which four of the -- this Court's last eight cases have come, there is a situation that is worth notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.402" offset="9685953">In Florida, there is a statute providing for a public defendant in the larger counties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2421.849" offset="9791801">So that my point here is that, we may be comforted in this constitutional moment by the fact, as it clearly is, that what we are doing represents a deliberate change after 20 years, after 20 years of experience, and it represents a change that clearly has the overwhelming support of the bench and the Bar and even of the states themselves.</text>
