            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="10.743" offset="148417">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.068" offset="153642">This case involves the conviction of 187 Negro students in Columbia, South Carolina for a common law breach of the peace for having engaged in a demonstration at and around the Columbia, South Carolina State House.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.685" offset="224172">And here behind me is an aerial photograph of the area in question which is not in the record, but which counsel for respondent have agreed with us would be helpful for the Court’s understanding of what happened in the case, and I may refer to it during the course of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.223" offset="298360">These demonstrations took place in March of 1960 at the time of the various sit-in and other related demonstrations in the South at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.621" offset="351859">And it would be useful at the outset to read the definition of common law breach of the peace which has been adopted by the Supreme Court of South Carolina, and that appears in its opinion on page 200 of the record -- its opinion in turn quotes American jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.195" offset="446213">In general term --</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="87.696" offset="456244">200 of the printed record.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.337" offset="474739">In general terms, a breach of the peace is a violation of public order, a disturbance of the public tranquility by any act or conduct inciting to violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.318" offset="518729">It includes any violation of any law enacted to preserve peace and good order.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.699" offset="536179">It may consist of an act of violence or an act likely to produce violence, and I stress in that reading the repeated use of the word violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.481" offset="583304">Now, the warrant under which the petitioners were charged appears in the record at three places at pages 2 and 3, at page 126, and at page 183.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.808" offset="656656">And it was read into the record by the Court rather than having been copied by the stenographer and there are some slight immaterial variations at each point.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.804" offset="704616">However, for purposes the warrant as read on pages 2 and 3 are adequate and it concludes commencing at the last three words on page 2, on the state capital ground, on adjacent sidewalks and streets, did commit a breach of the peace and that they, together with a large group of people, had assembled and impede the normal traffic, singing and parading with placards, failed to disperse upon lawful orders of police officer, all of which tended directly to immediate violence and breach of the peace in view of the existing condition.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="186.206" stopTime="187.913">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="186.206" offset="850275">Where else would you say that appears in the record?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="187.913" stopTime="339.753">
            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="187.913" offset="857067">On page 126 and on page 183.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.897" offset="880995">It appears in its fullest form on 183 but the language -- on 126, I might indicate here is an obvious stenographic error and that the word violation appears instead of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.469" offset="943271">Again, I stress that the rule of law under which petitioners were convicted, contemplates violence and the warrants with which they were charged contemplate violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.253" offset="986425">Now, the Circuit Court opinion, that is the intermediate appellate court opinion, also suggests that there was violence, but not so strongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.611" offset="1039820">On pages 193 and 194, there is a discussion of the reason why the conviction should be upheld, and at page 194 is the -- what I would call suggestion of violence at the end of the first full paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.719" offset="1108261">While it is a constitutional right to assemble in a hall to espouse any cause, no person has the right to organize demonstrations which any ordinary and reasonable thinking citizen know or reasonably should know would stir up passions and create incidence of disorder.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.170" offset="1178060">And so, the concept of violence at this stage of the litigation is now being watered down.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.840" offset="1200734">And when we reach the State Supreme Court where the conviction finally is affirmed, there is no mention of violence whatsoever in the affirmance, which we -- a pertinent portion of which we may find on page 201.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.264" offset="1262488">In the large paragraph on that page, the third one at the end, the State Supreme Court opposed the convictions below on these terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.608" offset="1299895">The orders of the police officers under all of the facts and circumstances were reasonable and motivated solely by a proper concern for the preservation of order and prevention of further interference with traffic upon the public streets and sidewalks.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.035" offset="1361544">The appellants not only refused to heed and obey the reasonable orders of the police, but engaged in a 15-minute noisy demonstration in defiance of such orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.134" offset="1401981">And so the conviction which originally was based on a rule of law, contemplating violence and a warrant charging violence ultimately is upheld on the basis of a State Supreme Court finding of interference with traffic and making noise.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.916" offset="1501038">That is quoted in our brief on page 19, I believe, Mr. Justice Harlan, in Footnote 2, it is set forth in terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.353" offset="1562791">Now, subsequent to the writing of our brief, the Supreme Court of South Carolina has decided another case which refers to and further characterizes its opinion in this, the Edwards case, and that opinion is not yet reported, and that is the City of Sumter versus McAllister.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.752" offset="1644398">And in that case, it reverses a conviction for breach of the peace, stating that in the McAllister case, unlike the Edwards case, which is the case now before us, there were neither large numbers of people nor interference with traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.820" offset="1712734">And so its characterization of Edwards in the McAllister case is that Edwards was a case involving large numbers of people and interference with traffic, again, nothing about violence.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.133" offset="1801968">Should I submit a copy to the Court, it would be quite simple to do that?</text>

          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="428.109" stopTime="428.537">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="428.109" offset="1817851">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_greenberg" startTime="428.537" stopTime="913.243">
            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="428.537" offset="1819523">Yes, it will be there tomorrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.572" offset="1835719">Now, our argument in this case is that first of all, that on this record, there is absolutely no evidence of violence or insipient violence by petitioners or by anyone else that is neither petitioners nor the so-called onlookers who presumably were in opposition group were violent and threaten violence, no indication of violence could've occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.074" offset="1917743">Consequently, under the decisions of this Court, the most pertinent one would be Taylor versus Louisiana, Garner versus Louisiana, and Thompson versus the City of Louisville.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.142" offset="1961942">These convictions must fall as being based upon no evidence of either the charge made or in this case, the rule of law under which the charge was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.568" offset="1999663">Secondly, that it -- in the facts of this case, somehow rather, there can be seen a situation involving actual or imminent or threatened violence and it would be violence in the part of onlookers, not in the part of these petitioners who admittedly were quite peaceful towards everything they did, and we deny this can be found in the conduct of the onlookers, but if it were to be found in there, it was the duty of the police to proceed against the aggressors or the would-be aggressors and not to gratify these aggressors by proceeding against those who were committing no violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.374" offset="2138948">And in fact, there is a South Carolina statute which we do not have quoted in our brief, which is Section 16-559 which makes it a crime to assault someone for expressing a political opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.503" offset="2199448">And so, this further sharpens the notion that it was the duty of the police to proceed against those who would assault the petitioners who were expressing what obviously was a political opinion, and that moreover decisions of this Court, Taylor versus Louisiana, Aaron v. Cooper, Little Rock School case, Buchanan v. Warley, all stand for the proposition that it is the aggressors who must be put down and not those who were engaged constitutionally protected freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.090" offset="2321805">Moreover, we have reference in our argument that we will have to the case of Feiner versus New York upon which the court below rested its opinion and upon which the respondent rests.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.042" offset="2361616">It's our position that the Feiner case is quite clearly distinguishable on its facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.825" offset="2380737">The facts in the Feiner case and the issues in the Feiner case were not the facts and issues here.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.551" offset="2403621">However, it would be our position that to any extent, Feiner were pertinent here, we would submit that it was the dissenters in Feiner who were correct and who have been vindicated by subsequent law especially in this area and that the majority opinion no longer is the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.177" offset="2478122">And finally, it is our contention that if these petitioners could be punished at all, they should not have been punished under a vague, general, common law concept of breach of the peace, and by this, we have -- we advert to the opinion of this Court in Cantwell versus Connecticut, and Mr. Justice Harlan's concurring opinion in the Garner case, but that they should have been punished if at all, they could have been punished under a narrowly drawn precise statute directed to this kind of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.271" offset="2594523">And that in fact, in South Carolina at this time, there were a number of statutes, a disorderly conduct statute, a statute regulating traffic around the State House grounds, an ordinance in Columbia limiting the size of groups that might parade and the ordinance in Columbia directed to blocking the sidewalk.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.526" offset="2671532">And that all these statutes and ordinance that might have applied to the situation, but instead not proceeding on any of them which express state policy with regard to this type of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.003" offset="2717403">The State in fact proceeded under its very general notion of breach of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.808" offset="2736630">Now the facts of the case were the 190 Negro college and high school students gathered in a church in Columbia early in March 1960 with the purpose of protesting racial segregation in the State of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.166" offset="2806115">They proceeded to march from the church to the State House in small groups of about 15 to 18, each group being separated from the other by one-third to one-half of a block.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.667" offset="2856061">Now the record, I think is complicated but becomes immediately simple if you look at this picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.865" offset="2888871">They came from this direction down Gervais Street and when they reached -- assembled here, some of them entered the State House ground at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.077" offset="2925756">And some of them continued down Gervais Street and entered the State House grounds at this point, which is also known as the “horseshoe.”</text>
            <text syncTime="713.440" offset="2959193">Now the reason for numbers was that the numbers were a function of the expression in which they were trying to engage.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.853" offset="2996809">Their point was and this appears quite clearly in the record, that it is often said that Negroes like segregation in the South, that they're not dissatisfied with it, and that they don't want to do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.899" offset="3041008">And they may very deliberately got together a large number of people to go and make this protest so as to make the point that there was general dissatisfaction with these conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.374" offset="3078938">And on page 112 of the record, one of the demonstrators testified, “We were there to protest in order that they might see for themselves that the -- we were in number and that we did not and we still do not go along with the principles of segregation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="760.883" offset="3148946">And so, this was not a type of protest that could have been made reasonably in any other way other than the way in which it was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.726" offset="3184368">They carried with them signs and placards such as down with segregation and things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.053" offset="3225642">They entered the State House grounds, at the two points that I indicated, and on the scene were a number of police officers, the number of which is not clear from the record, the police officers themselves estimate anywhere from 15 to 40 city police officers, a number of the most commonly given number is about 30 however, a number of representatives of the state law enforcement division and two deputy sheriffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.123" offset="3333893">They were quiet and they were orderly and the record is quite clear in a good many places though you might most particularly refer to page 88 when the chief was asked, “Did any of your men make a report that any of these persons were disorderly in walking around the State House grounds?”</text>
            <text syncTime="825.392" offset="3407036">They did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.390" offset="3411007">Under normal circumstances, your men would report to you when you're at the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.259" offset="3426471">They should.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.653" offset="3432009">Is it reasonable to assume then that there was no disorderly conduct on the part of these persons since you receive no report from your officer?</text>
            <text syncTime="839.163" offset="3462102">I would take that for granted, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.504" offset="3471402">Now there is some testimony that they were singing and otherwise vocal when they first entered the grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.056" offset="3505674">However, this was given by State officers who upon cross-examination in each instance retracted this testimony and it's quite clear that none of the singing occurred until after they were given an order to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.138" offset="3558024">After they entered the State House grounds, they proceeded to walk around the State House quietly bearing signs all the while, in fact, all during the time in question in these small groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.412" offset="3611105">While they were doing this, traffic to some extent slowed down to see what was going on and a police officer was dispatched to the scene to move the traffic along more expeditiously.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.316" offset="3654677">At the same time, people coming in and out of the State House during the lunch hour were to some extent interfered with, however, the sidewalk was at all times wide enough to accommodate more than two persons walking abreast, the petitioners were never more than two abreast and there was no real difficulty of anyone from the part of anyone in getting involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.619" offset="3735865">And pedestrians were freely able to go in and out of the area.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="919.965" offset="3785289">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.530" offset="3787588">And throughout this considerable area, I'm informed that the area from here to here is approximately a thousand feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.808" offset="3812665">In other words, the blocks are 500 feet each.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.442" offset="3843176">Now at this time, a group of onlookers began to gather.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.941" offset="3857178">Approximately 150 people in the horseshoe area here, though it's not clear whether that also includes the demonstrators but at any rate, there were about 150 people here.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.759" offset="3900437">And the estimates of the number of onlookers varies all the way from 200, from the part of some police officers up to 350 which is the outside total, most of them however, being across the street over here, the onlookers were merely curious.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.577" offset="3967728">No one uttered any threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.521" offset="3979536">There was no violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.940" offset="3985178">There was no effort at violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.491" offset="4003359">Nobody -- nobody said anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.241" offset="4014435">In some instances, they were blocking traffic and the police asked them to move on and when the police asked them to move on, they did move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.535" offset="4043588">Now among these onlookers, the people -- the police recognized some persons whom they described as the long-haired boys were troublemakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.533" offset="4083503">This was a very ill-defined term and no particular troublemaker could be identified and no particular troublemaker did anything and no particular so-called troublemaker, I should say, engaged in making any trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.384" offset="4138987">When the troublemakers were asked or so-called troublemakers were asked to move on and leave in all instances they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.481" offset="4167304">There was no disobedience on their part at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.366" offset="4178902">The 30 to 40 police State officers and sheriffs were in the testimony of the police, ample to handle the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.527" offset="4215578">And in fact, the police testified that if they had not been ample, they could have easily summoned more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.777" offset="4240551">I'd like to briefly refer to page -- to our brief here where we set forth some of the pertinent testimony which is however in many places repeated throughout the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.020" offset="4301469">On page 10 of the brief, there is a quotation, the chief said, “We were afraid that trouble might have come.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.767" offset="4324456">Counsel: I see, you were afraid trouble might occur from what source?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.660" offset="4336055">Chief: You can't always tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.489" offset="4347340">Counsel: But if you regard it on this occasion, it was sufficiently apparent to require you to arrest them, vertainly, you must have had something in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.277" offset="4374507">Chief: It is my duty to try to avoid trouble if I can as a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.514" offset="4391434">Counsel: I fully appreciate that, I certainly do, but I simply ask you where was the trouble?</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.937" offset="4409198">Chief: Actually, any trouble hadn't happened but if you can prevent trouble, it's your duty to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.756" offset="4428424">Counsel: I go along with that, are you able to assert to say where the trouble was?</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.776" offset="4444515">Chief: I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.150" offset="4454024">Then the City Manager testified, “I'm afraid that curiosity changes and brings forth possible elements which would create difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.777" offset="4484535">Counsel: Did you see any of those possible elements?</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.291" offset="4494566">“Yes, I did as I have in every occasion when these groups have demonstrated.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.215" offset="4510239">“Speaking of this particular occasion, did you see the possible elements there that day?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.289" offset="4526540">“Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.499" offset="4531451">“Who were those persons?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.786" offset="4536571">“I can't tell you who they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.576" offset="4543676">I can tell you they were present in the group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.156" offset="4550050">They were recognized as possible troublemakers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.257" offset="4562484">“Did you and your police chief do anything about placing those people under arrest?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.838" offset="4576799">“No, we had no occasion to place them under arrest.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1126.289" offset="4610550">Now, “Sir, you've stated they were possible troublemakers and your whole testimony has been that as a City Manager, a supervisor of the city police, your object is to preserve the peace and law and order.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.445" offset="4647225">“That's right.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.925" offset="4653077">“Yet, you took no official action against people who were present and possibly might have done some harm to these people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.459" offset="4675229">“We took no official action because there was none to be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.883" offset="4688917">They were not creating a disturbance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.548" offset="4695604">Those particular people were not at that time doing anything to make trouble, but they could have been.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.910" offset="4717025">“Did you order them off the State House grounds?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.184" offset="4726115">“They were not on the State House grounds that I've observed and so in fact, these people were all across the street which is possibly a quarter or fifth adjacent to the block, at least a 100 feet away.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.426" offset="4779092">“Did you order them off the streets adjacent?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.183" offset="4786197">“They were on public sidewalks and we made them clear the sidewalks so that people could get through.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.269" offset="4806468">“You don't know who these people were but nevertheless, you recognized them as troublemakers?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.131" offset="4821932">“I don't know them by name, no, but the minute you spotted them, you knew they were troublemakers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.658" offset="4844084">“I knew there was a possibility of trouble there.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.063" offset="4853697">“Yet, you took no official action against them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.716" offset="4864251">“The official action I took was to get rid of the cause with the possible difficulty.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.277" offset="4882536">“But you just said that the Negro students weren't doing anything wrong, that is, in terms of misdemeanor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.657" offset="4908032">“They were not obeying lawful orders what I consider lawful orders in dispersing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.117" offset="4921929">They were the cause of the group gathering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.685" offset="4928199">The group, the so-called troublemakers would never have appeared had it not been for the demonstration taking place.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.601" offset="4955784">And so, the petitioners were then told to leave and when told to leave, they stood there and sang the Stars Spangled Banner and sang some hymn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.425" offset="5003118">There was a conflict in testimony as to whether they engaged in the singing after being told to leave or after their order of arrest, but it would -- at least after the time they were told to leave that they engaged in the singing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.052" offset="5049616">As to the audibility of the singing, the best that the record indicates is that a police officer testified that he guessed it was audible all over the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.293" offset="5094546">They were found guilty of common law breach of the peace and were sentenced according to the following pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.507" offset="5115444">All of those over 21 years of age received $100 fine or 30 days in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.242" offset="5142403">Those between the ages of 17 and 21 received the same sentence which would be cut in half upon the payment of $50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.221" offset="5174272">And those under 17 received a $5 fine or 10 days in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.228" offset="5202380">Now, it is our first contention which can be referred to most easily after a recital of the evidence that with a warrant charging violence and a rule of law requiring a showing of violence, and a record showing that there was nothing but a peaceful protest to the State legislature which I neglected to mention was then in session with ample police on the scene that this case is precisely like Taylor versus Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.890" offset="5324946">In fact, the onlookers in this case are characterized in language identical to the language in the opinion in Taylor which said that at the trial, there was testimony that immediately upon petitioners' entry into the waiting room; many of the people in there became restless which we don't even have here, and that's some -- some onlookers climbed on to seats to get a better view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.146" offset="5425988">Nevertheless, respondents and that these persons moved on when ordered to do so by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.449" offset="5447199">There was no evidence of violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.896" offset="5453051">The record shows that the petitioners were quiet, orderly and polite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.962" offset="5469247">The trial court said -- who held it, that the mere presence of Negroes in a white waiting room was likely to give rise a breach of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.591" offset="5495787">And we submit the first point of our argument that these two cases were essentially identical in this respect and for this reason, the conviction could be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.409" offset="5535075">But, we submit, secondly, even if in this situation, somehow there could be seen and we deny that it rationally can be found, a situation of incipient violence, then the police should have gone after the troublemakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.913" offset="5585021">If they had any reason to believe that these people were violating the law, were committing a crime, they should have gone after them, and they had a South Carolina statute which I referred to earlier specifically directed against those they would've thought persons engaged in expression of political opinion, that they should not have taken action to gratify the aggressors and our authority for that is as I stated earlier, Little Rock case, Cooper versus Aaron, Buchanan versus Warley and [Inaudible].</text>

            <text syncTime="1419.777" offset="5784492">The Senate was sitting at this time, but the Assembly was not, and that was the part of the purpose I would imagine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.645" offset="5811973">I don't think the record is quite clear that they went there -- that they were sitting at that time but their purpose was to direct their dissatisfaction to the members of legislature [Inaudible].</text>

            <text syncTime="1463.118" offset="5957841">Now, the court below rest on Feiner versus New York and the respondent's brief cites only three cases, one of which is Feiner versus New York and so it rests on this entirely on Feiner versus New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.364" offset="6014892">And we say first of all that this case is completely distinguishable from Feiner on the facts that this case, unlike Feiner, does not involve persons who incited a crowd to rise up in arms or to do anything violent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.862" offset="6080825">These people did nothing of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.317" offset="6086677">They merely carried signs, quietly expressing dissatisfaction with racial segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.145" offset="6113949">There was no showing of a threat to the police or the speaker in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.030" offset="6137563">In the Feiner case, there was a threat to the speaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.998" offset="6157416">Someone said, if you don't get them up there, I will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.792" offset="6172568">In the Feiner case, there were two policemen and 78 or 80 people out in the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.553" offset="6191585">Here, there were 30 to 40 policemen and the police officers testified that this was ample police to control the situation that everyone was obedient, but should they need more police, they could get more police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.272" offset="6238501">And finally, and this leads me into the next point of my argument, the Feiner case did not discuss the issue of vagueness when it impinges upon a constitutionally protected right such as freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.113" offset="6301821">Feiner involved a breach of the peace ordinance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1590.885" offset="6469005">We submit, finally, that the Feiner case, that the dissent in the Feiner case was correct and not the majority if the matter of the facts being different and everything else, if we're not correct so far as that's concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.426" offset="6535147">Now, this leads us into the last portion of our argument, and that is that if petitioners could have been punished at all for anything and we don't see whether they could have been punished here, certainly, when they were engaged in free expression, it should not have been under a generalized breach of the peace provision which exists in the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.195" offset="6630233">Now we think in this respect, Cantwell against Connecticut governs the situation completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.219" offset="6654265">Cantwell involved common law breach of the peace as it applied Jehovah's Witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.754" offset="6676417">And the opinion of the Court said, we think that in the absence of a statute narrowly drawn to define and punish specific conduct as constituting a clear and present danger to a substantial interest of the State, the petitioners' communication considered in the light of the constitutional guarantees raise no such clear and present menace to public peace and order as to render him liable to conviction of the common law offense in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.079" offset="6773697">And this essentially is what Mr. Justice Harlan said in his concurring opinion, in Garner case, I would submit, when he said that when a state seeks to subject the criminal sanctions conduct which -- except for a demonstrated paramount state interest, would be within the range of freedom of expression as assured by the Fourteenth Amendment it cannot do so by means of a general and all-inclusive breach of the peace prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.752" offset="6868470">It must bring the activity sought to be proscribed within the ambit of a statute or clause narrowly drawn to define and punish specific conduct as constituting a clear and present danger with substantial interest of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.682" offset="6920192">Now, in South Carolina at this time, there were at least five pieces of legislation that could have dealt with this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1921.514" offset="7791428">Some emphasis had been given in the counsel's argument with respect to some facts, some facts that I would give more emphasis to, some facts I think, have been omitted which I think would be of considerable help to the Court to determine these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.247" offset="7854435">It's apparent from the record that up until a certain point, there was no outward manifestation of this order other than the obstruction of sidewalks and traffic lanes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.794" offset="7928623">It's apparent from the record in its entirety that there was no overt act committed by any onlooker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.720" offset="7960283">And it's apparent and cleared by the record and I think beyond any dispute that this assemblage was permitted to demonstrate for 30 to 45 minutes and by the testimony of one of the defendants himself for a period of about one hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.946" offset="8033217">It's clear therefore that they were permitted to carry on their demonstration at least 30 minutes to 45 minutes unmolested at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.552" offset="8079611">It's clear also as to the number of participants in this demonstration and the testimony generally is in agreement as to the manner in which the processions approached the State House and how they acted thereafter although there are some immaterial variances about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.276" offset="8162576">It's clear also that these persons were permitted by persons in authority to enter the State House and to conduct a peaceable demonstration when they requested permission to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.963" offset="8229240">But beyond that point, there is a difference of interpretation on the facts between myself and counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="2095.587" offset="8487748">Some of them according to the testimony paraded along the largest streets or sidewalks on the outer limits of the State House property, some on the smaller walkways in here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2365.410" offset="9567023">It was clear that the parade in the manner that I've outlined a moment ago, but it's clear moreover that -- and the times up fairly well fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.751" offset="9616447">The time of arrest, it's been pointed beyond any question, at 1:15 in the afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.948" offset="9645181">And it's generally agreed that these proceedings through the State House grounds started about noontime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.290" offset="9686559">Therefore, there was an interval of about one hour before any action was taken by anyone in authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.896" offset="9716966">Now, after they had paraded around the State House grounds, around the streets that enclosed the entire State House area, for a period of approximately 35 -- 30 to 45 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.991" offset="9781436">Then they were requested to disperse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.892" offset="9793034">Now, at that time, at the time that they were requested to disperse, they were obstructing -- obstruct -- they were obstructing the sidewalks, the traffic ways and the passages leading into the State House grounds and in this area known as the horseshoe area which I would estimate could be approximately 60 feet in width.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.943" offset="9897211">That obstruction of traffic is clearly shown by the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.188" offset="9922184">In addition to that, the onlookers were not concentrated upon that point -- in the area immediate -- across Gervais Street from the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.310" offset="9954680">The onlookers were eventually channeled in this area along here in the horseshoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.158" offset="9974011">The onlookers primarily came at that time from persons who were getting out of their work for the lunch hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.615" offset="10007865">The onlookers also came from office buildings across the street, across the street here from a hotel building across the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.480" offset="10031376">This is the part of U.S. Highway 1, a very busy intersection particularly at that time of day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.254" offset="10066484">The estimate of the number of persons who were attracted to this demonstration varied I think from about 200 up to one witness who testified 400.</text>
            <text syncTime="2498.284" offset="10098563">They generally testified, I believe, the majority of them testified that about 200 to 300 persons were attracted to this demonstration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.374" offset="10146941">Now, I state a moment ago that there was obstruction of the walkways -- obstructions of the streets.</text>

            <text syncTime="2569.817" offset="10384656">Well, the conditions varied from time to time but in numerous times, they were blocked almost completely with probably as many as 30 or 40 persons both on the sidewalk and in the street area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.872" offset="10424884">Further along, he stated it was extremely difficult for a pedestrian wanting to get through to get through.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.601" offset="10451843">On page 26, he testified, the people that I saw were congregated right around the horseshoe area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.852" offset="10472845">Many backed up into the driveway, into the horseshoe area across the sidewalk on the lawns adjacent to the horseshoe area and across Gervais Street on both corners of Maine and Gervais.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.923" offset="10521119">The Chief of Police testified, sidewalks and traffic lanes, I'm interpolating traffic lanes, were right crowded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.053" offset="10549645">And from time to time, we had to ask pedestrians to move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.005" offset="10565423">Further along he said, we had to place a traffic man at the intersection to handle traffic and pedestrians.</text>

            <text syncTime="2799.917" offset="11305106">Further on, what led -- in answer to the question, what led you to believe there might be a riot?</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.120" offset="11325900">The size of the crowd, the activities of the students, the types of persons, willing, ready and able and eager to create violence whether along -- blocking of streets and sidewalks was a factor in -- him arriving at the conclusion that these -- that the matter should be dispersed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.738" offset="11396326">Now, that is as -- as I've said, a significant step separate from what, from the order of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.297" offset="11418582">And I can state in all frankness to the Court here that at the time that order of dispersal was given after the matter has gone on for about 45 minutes, at the time that order of dispersal was given, there's an entirely different set of facts that this Court would have faced, had an arrest been made at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.577" offset="11507712">This Court would, as I see it, have been faced only with the fact that these groups of students were parading but they were obstructing traffic lanes, obstructing sidewalks on public property on the State House capital ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.081" offset="11565704">Now, after that dispersal order was given then an entirely different set of facts is presented for the Court's consideration and that is what led to the arrest of these students.</text>

            <text syncTime="4598.849" offset="18500796">As I read the charge in this record, looking at it on page 2 and 3, the impeding of normal traffic and singing and parading with placards and failing to disperse upon lawful orders of the police are presented in a causal connection with tending directly to immediate violence and breach of the peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.420" offset="18607062">In other words, these are not set forth in the disjunctive that they committed a crime in that they sang and paraded (a), failed to disperse (b), impeded traffic (c), intended to lead the violence (d) these first three things are suppose to have led to the violence, and I think any plain reading of the charge indicates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.307" offset="18686683">And so, we have a charge as well as a common law rule requiring a showing of violence.</text>

            <text syncTime="4657.830" offset="18736734">But even if these were to be read under disjunctive, that is if petitioners could be found guilty of impeding traffic in the moment, I hope to demonstrate the record as quite clear on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="4691.375" offset="18870899">As there were three purposes set forth in the statute and the jury was instructed that their verdict might be given with respect to anyone of them independently considered it is impossible to say under which clause of the statute the conviction was obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.475" offset="18927323">If anyone of these clauses which the state court has held to be separable was invalid, it cannot be determined upon this record that the appellant was not convicted under that clause, just as here, it cannot be contended that appellant was not convicted because of the charge of violence made against him on a record which shows that absolutely no violence occurred.</text>
