            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Retail Clerks International Association, Local 1625, Petitioners versus Alberta Schermerhorn.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.001" offset="151385">Mr. Lippman you may continue your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="s_g_lippman" startTime="15.116" stopTime="508.122">
            <label>Mr. S. G. Lippman</label>
            <text syncTime="15.116" offset="163819">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.701" offset="178134">Yesterday, I sought to develop the argument that there is a complete integration between Section 14 (b) and Section 8 (a) (3), point being that but for the proviso in Section 8 (a) (3) setting forth the conditions under which a union can obtain a valid union shop or a union security arrangement; but, for that proviso, it would otherwise constitute an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.742" offset="326301">I sought to point out that 14 (b) was as much a proviso as that which is explicitly stated in 8 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="64.349" offset="360782">It would, obviously, seem quite anomalous for Congress to grant the authority of the States to outlaw, as a matter of substantive law a union shop and then at the same time to say that this is permissible under the proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.253" offset="428387">I think any fair reading would indicate as this Court has I think indicated in the first Schermerhorn case that there is the complete interrelationship between these sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.797" offset="470601">Beyond that I endeavor to point out that when one contemplates the punitive aspects of state enforcement, it would seem utterly incomprehensible and beyond belief that Congress, which attempted to set out this entire scheme of labor relations, would have permitted that kind of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.018" offset="547401">At the point of adjournment, I stated the position as I understood it of the government and we find that we are not as far apart as we thought we were.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.645" offset="601945">The government agrees that all conduct prior to the actual execution of the contract, the strikes and picketing and boycott which may take place is preemptive and is exclusively within the jurisdiction of the federal government and I believe it must take that position because of the major thrust of the Curry case.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.733" offset="738304">I do believe, however, that the strikes and picketing and the execution are so much part of the same ball of wax that it seems almost arbitrary to draw the line at that particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.069" offset="835688">Of course, if my -- if our first contention is correct as I believe it is, that the execution of a law in violation of a state right to work law constitutes an unfair labor practice, I think that would be dispositive of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.476" offset="897233">On the other hand, let's examine some aspects of the government's position, because in our mind the administration of the execution on the application is so thoroughly related to other provisions of the Labor Act that one would be faced with continuous conflicts in substance and in administration and would take this Court years to unravel the puzzle.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.562" offset="1033592">The first point, the actual exe -- seeking to enjoin the actual execution of a contract alleged to violate the state right to work law would immediately constitute interference with the collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.822" offset="1110706">At what point does the state say that there is a threat that a collective bargaining agreement violative of its law is about to be executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.873" offset="1142888">This, of course, must look to the actual processes involved and the collective bargaining involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.337" offset="1172668">Beyond that, we have seen how zealous the States are in finding violations of its right to work law.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.317" offset="1208613">Indeed as this Court has observed in the Agency Shop Case, the Schermerhorn Case, it would have been best in this situation where there was a question of whether or not the agency shop falls within the proviso to permit the federal government in the first instance to make that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.683" offset="1282069">We have even a more dramatic illustration of that in connection with the hiring hall situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.869" offset="1310804">The State of Texas, the Attorney General, and some of lower Courts have held that a hiring hall violates its right to work laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.840" offset="1346748">It has enjoined the picketing and the strikes in that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.255" offset="1364407">A year-and-a-half later, the Labor Board in the case, which we cite in our brief, said that this is a permissible activity, but the union, of course, is still enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.804" offset="1410591">Now, what about a question of a discharge under a union security contract and a right to work state?</text>
            <text syncTime="341.264" offset="1468479">A complaint is filed saying that the individual's discharge because he refused to join or remain a member of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.562" offset="1509648">The defense of the union and the employer is that he was not discharged for that purpose, but he was discharged pursuant to his seniority clause in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.026" offset="1551444">This raised the question of intent and the surrounding circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.221" offset="1576208">The very kind of problems that Congress, I believe, has left to the expertise of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.875" offset="1606823">If the Court should find -- a State Court should find that the discharge was unlawful it could be wrong, the Board might have come to another conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.933" offset="1639111">The Court thereby has interfered with the collective bargaining process (Inaudible) and the Court has interfered with Section 7 rights, because this contract was negotiated pursuant to Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.162" offset="1688012">The point being that at every stage in the administration of an executed contract, you invariably come into conflict with the scheme of the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.111" offset="1731793">Let's take the example of a minority union, which executes a contract containing the unlawful union security clause in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.999" offset="1783411">This plainly constitutes an unfair labor practice, because the minority union in the first place has no business negotiating contracts with the employer as the exclusive bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.509" offset="1833357">It constitutes a violation of 8 (a) (3), it constitutes a violation of other sections of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.731" offset="1858330">Plainly the Labor Board would enjoin that kind of a contract, it would set aside that kind of a contract, shall we then say that the Labor Board has lost its jurisdiction because it contained an illegal union security clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="457.103" offset="1931786">Take the situation of a majority union.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.385" offset="1952893">A majority union executes that kind of a contract and plainly in a minority union case the Labor Board has jurisdiction, but in the majority case it would be urged under no circumstances does the Labor Board have any jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.618" offset="2017886">But then suppose the majority union is bargaining for such a contract to the point of impasse and then goes on strike to obtain it, the government would recognize that there would be no jurisdiction and the state courts to enjoin that strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.579" offset="2057697">That would be a matter for the Labor Board, but if it succeeded in pressuring the employer into granting it the contract only at that point would the state courts have jurisdiction and by some magic the federal government would loose jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="551.553" offset="2309622">The difference relief is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.049" offset="2315577">In a state court not the union would be subject to all damages in connection with the strike including punitive damages if a state were to take jurisdiction in that kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.389" offset="2364897">In addition to that, if it occurred in the State of Georgia the officials might be very well (Inaudible), there is just that difference which is very, very substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.515" offset="2437413">Now, I will end my direct statement to the Court by pointing out that in this entire field, there is such a close interrelationship that one cannot permit the states to enter into this field without, at the same time, creating an unwarranted intrusion in the actual application and in the execution of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.865" offset="2602820">This is a field which I believe Congress has left to the federal government and the idea of any kind of concurrent jurisdiction would actually in practical operations completely oust the federal government of its regulatory powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="655.308" offset="2724655">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.619" offset="2741896">As we all know the formulation of the national labor relations policy does not only take into consideration the rights and interests of the unions, the rights and interests of the management, the rights of interests of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.401" offset="2800933">The formulation the national labor relations policy contemplates primarily the rights and interests of the individual working men, that the Taft-Hartley law was characterized as the bill of rights of the American working men.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.056" offset="2863626">I am here representing for working people from the state of Florida in fact now reduced to one, those three are no longer working for the Food Fair Chain involved in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.677" offset="2922036">We in Florida believe that the right to work is a right to live, the right to be able to obtain money to pay for the necessities of life.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.377" offset="2964877">And we feel that it is a fundamental right that can only be protected by the Courts and cannot be protected solely by an administrative agency and that is the reason why Florida passed the right-to-work law.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.765" offset="3030392">Before I go into the situation as we feel it's applicable here I would like to respond to some of the contentions made by brother Lippman particularly in response to the question asked by Mr. Justice Harlan.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.975" offset="3095280">Mr. Justice Harlan, in the state of Florida we do not have chain gangs where we send union executives or employers if they violate the Florida right-to-work law.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.992" offset="3139375">In the state of Florida we do not permit punitive damages to be imposed by a Court of Equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.086" offset="3167692">This case was initiated in the Circuit Court of Dade County, the Equity Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.870" offset="3190888">I was the attorney representing the four individual working people at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.769" offset="3210428">All our Equity Court can do in the state of Florida is grant an injunction to enjoin the execution or application of a compulsory unionism contract which this Court has said this agency shop device or gimmick actually is.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.493" offset="3273331">The Court can also award an accounting of any at all fees or dues that were coerced or exacted from the individual working men because of this type of a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.198" offset="3316172">The Court can also award court costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.468" offset="3325262">Unfortunately our Florida Laws do not permit attorneys fees, so the Court cannot even award attorney's fees or punitive damages against a union in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1029.890" offset="4222934">I believe that there may have been some misreliance placed upon the case because as I understand the case, the Texas Court granted a temporary injunction based upon some verified pleadings that shortly thereafter the union and the employers entered into a stipulation wherein they made a new contract without the hiring hall provision and stipulated that there would not appeal the Texas Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.334" offset="4344665">So it is not a situation, the injunction is still remaining in full force and in effect, the union and management did get together and resolved their problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="1084.072" offset="4439646">The question before this Court is whether or not Congress in yielding to the states the right to enact right-to-work laws also said to the states that you have the right to enforce your own laws and certainly it would be a unique, not an eccentric result, but a unique result in the event Congress says to the states, you have the right, you have the continued right to do something that you have been traditional doing, you have the right to do so but you have no right to enforce your own laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.455" offset="4565243">That is something that would be extremely unique in American jurisprudence and there has been no authority cited by brother Lippman to show that there was any other contrary intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.758" offset="6118379">We have a situation of Congress specifically spelling out in Congressional debates, in Congressional records and in Section 14 (b) that nothing was intended to displace the states in their power to regulate compulsory unionism within the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1581.513" offset="6429445">They did not do so and certainly the vociferous opponents of the Taft-Hartley Act would have urged that such a proviso be put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.444" offset="6465181">There was no question whatsoever from the opponents of the Taft-Hartley Act which they characterized as a slave labor bill that the states did not have the right to enact and enforce their own right-to-work bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.167" offset="6516067">In fact the attorneys in Congress certainly would have yelled and complained vociferously if it was believed that the states could pass laws and yet Congress and the Courts would say that the states cannot enforce their own laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.958" offset="6587225">The question now comes up, what good is a right without a remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.049" offset="6611571">We as attorneys have always felt that if we have a right that we have the right and the power to go into a Court to have our rights enforced. Now unfortunately in non right-to-work states, if a right-to-work violation is committed or for that matter there would be a right-to-work violation was committed, the person who has been aggrieved can only seek relief through the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.040" offset="6723584">And if the Regional Director or the General Counsel refused to act on the compliant of the aggrieved party that person has no recourse whatsoever to the courts and that person's remedy has actually been lost because of the failure to act of an administrative agent. In Florida, we would not be deprived of that fundamental right, the right to be granted, the right to be able to work, the right to eat, the right to live.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.561" offset="6841657">And yet that is something that the union would seek to deprive the individual working men of, that right to be able to go into the Court and get some quick relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.984" offset="6887320">Now we can go into our Courts in Florida, into Equity Court in Florida if the union and management seeks to execute a unionism contract and we can go in there and if that is the issue before the Court, the Court will grant quick relief to us and we will have quick relief within a two month period of time, but if we were relegated to going through the processes of the National Labor Relations Board, which the federal judges characterized as a sort of a slow march, almost analogous to the march of a wounded snake creeping along, if we went into the National Labor Relations Board it takes in some instances at least 400 days before the final decision is rendered by the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.555" offset="7061608">And when the Board finally renders its decision, the Board cannot itself enforce its decision if the Board was to enter a cease and desist order, the Board must go to the federal Courts and obtain an injective, an injunction in the Federal Courts which might take from the time the appeal goes through another 300 days, possibly 700, 800 days goes by before the individual workingmen would be able to obtain effective relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.712" offset="7170173">By that time the matter is merely one of academic interest and the relief and the remedy that the Courts had to protect is something that is meaningless to the average working men.</text>

            <text syncTime="2306.244" offset="9328306">I say in the first instance that when there is any doubt the state Courts would send it to the National Labor Relations Board and then let the National Labor Relations Board decide whether to cede it back to the state courts and that were in, incidentally the state Courts are to utilize state law once the National Labor Relations Board sends it back to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2349.590" offset="9501759">I say the Congress did not intend to make it an unfair labor practice by not spelling it out in the act and it may very well be an unfair labor practice, but that still does not mean as in the Smith versus Evening News Association case that a matter may not also be an unfair labor practice at the same time the individual can go into the state court to obtain their rights under contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.353" offset="9608756">If Mr. Justice White, you recall on that Smith case, the unions and management conceded that this was an unfair labor practice and yet they were permitted to go into the state courts to seek their damages for violation of collective bargaining contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2466.539" offset="9969560">We conclude by saying that Congress did not empower the National Labor Relations Board to process violations of state laws, but left it to the State Courts and we respectfully ask this Court to affirm the Florida Court and do not permit our Florida right to work law to be mutilated because we cannot enforce our own law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2505.290" offset="10124518">The prior proceedings in this litigation established two points beyond dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.850" offset="10150745">Now first the petition is agency short contract violates the Florida right to work law and second the Florida is right to work law is applicable to the petitioners because their operation is affecting the State of Commerce at least in substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.146" offset="10223992">The only question remaining is whether a state has jurisdiction to enforce in some manner because there's been no decree here, to enforce in some manner it's valid and substantively applicable law against an acknowledged violator.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.017" offset="10295463">We submit that the state has that jurisdiction because of the express declaration of Congress in Section 14 (b) and the case centers around the meaning of that express provision and not what the rules would be in the absence of such provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.037" offset="10367561">The court did raise in its prior opinion an obviously related question which was whether the execution of a contract that violated a state right to work law but was otherwise consistent with the proviso of the Section 8 (a) (3) was an unfair labor practice under the National Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.989" offset="10459303">We think did that question does not need to be answered here because it seems to us that whatever answer is given the Court's disposition on the central question the only one raised by this litigation must be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.646" offset="10521997">Our answer, it could be material is that the National Act establishes a single national uniform rule and that the contract would not be a Federal unfair labor practice under those circumstances, I should discuss the --</text>

            <text syncTime="2715.771" offset="10966497">It seems to us that the conclusion that Section 14 (b) leaves the states with jurisdiction to punish or grant other remedies for the execution or application of an unlawful union-security agreement is sustained by the words of the statute, by the legislative history, and by the uniform interpretation and practice from the time that have currently enacted, really down to the first argument of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2751.734" offset="11110275">Here I think the words gain so much meaning from their context and from the background that I'm going to take the liberty of discussing the legislative history first.</text>

            <text syncTime="2790.362" offset="11264815">And we think this has the effect of reversing the normal rules with respect to preemption, that's the nub of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.170" offset="11296057">In the beginning there is no question but that the state had jurisdiction to adapt right to work laws and enforce them against employers and labor unions in business affecting Interstate Commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.259" offset="11360423">Mr. Lippman keeps speaking as if the question where that was whether Congress had delegated some power to state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.838" offset="11386755">Of course the states unquestionably had that power and the question here is whether Congress has enacted legislation which under the supremacy clause somehow takes that power away from the states, by preempting the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.892" offset="11446941">Now the question of preemption first came up with respect to union-security contract in the deliberations on the Wagner Act and it was clearly expressed in committee reports and in statements on the floor by the sponsors of the legislation that it was not the intention of the Congress -- of the statute to interfere with the operation of state law on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.063" offset="11567626">The bill does nothing, the committee report said, to facilitate closed-shop agreements or to make them legal in any state where they maybe illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.070" offset="11603675">It does not interfere with the status quo on this debatable subject but leaves the way open to such agreements as might now legally be consummated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2910.900" offset="11746931">Now I come up by 1947 when 14 (b) came into plan there were two reasons for additional concerns about the question of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.314" offset="11804609">The first was that in the case of Hill and the Florida, this Court had held that Section 7 and 8 barred the application to interstate businesses of state laws restricting the employees' choice of bargaining representatives and it said that it barred their application, the language is quite interesting, because the collective bargaining which Congress has authorized contemplates two parties free to bargain and thus cannot be frustrated by state legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.249" offset="11944417">I'm emphasizing that the word authorized by Congress was used in the context of preemption and the reason in Hill and Florida for saying that there was preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.632" offset="11989870">Of course the argument was made both in this Court in AFL against Watson and elsewhere that the right to work clause could be challenged on the same ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.243" offset="12040338">Congress had authorized bargaining about union-security contract it was said and the argument went on, since Congress had authorized that bargaining that the states could not interfere with it by adopting and applying right to work laws and the contention was and this was so strong argument that it overcame the legislative history that I referred to earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.963" offset="12147231">The other reason for concern in 1947 was that about the danger of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.575" offset="12177638">Was the Congress intended to legislate the subject to Union security far more comprehensively than it had done before?</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.164" offset="12215986">Now if closed shop contracts would be outlawed, the discharges on the union security contracts which would be lawful were to be limited and in the original Taft-Hartley Act, Your Honors will remember, there was also a provision calling for a vote of the employees to authorize the bargaining representative to negotiate a union shop contract, unless there was such a vote the authority would not be granted, the contract would be an unfair labor practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="3078.859" offset="12418800">Alright with these two additional reasons for concern about preemption the house labor committee brought into its bill a Section 13, which appears on pages 20 and 21 of our brief, which is so long and cumbersome that I can't read it in Court, but it's worth finding out over on page 21 that it stated, all such agreements that is union security agreements insofar as they report to impose such requirements contrary to the provisions of the law, or constitution of any state are hereby divested of their characters a subject of regulation by Congress, skipping a few word, to the extent that such agreement shall in addition to being subject to applicable preventive provision for this act the subject to the operation and effect of such state laws in constitutional provisions as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.211" offset="12664247">No doubt from that language that it was intended to negate any inference of preemption from the Congressional regulation either on this express subject or from the more general provision dealing with the right to bargain collectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.347" offset="12728717">If there were any doubt it would be, it would be negated by the committee report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.180" offset="12752123">The committee said over on page 22 of my brief, by Section 13 the United States expressly declares the subject of compulsory unionism, one that the states may regulate concurrently with the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.968" offset="12815235">In the face of that one, one just couldn't conclude that there was any preemption I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.899" offset="12838954">The bill went to conference along with a senate bill but had no provision dealing that over lapped with Section 13.</text>

            <text syncTime="3207.627" offset="12933831">But the history makes it perfectly clear that all that Congress did was substituted a far similar declaration in Section 14 (b) for this extraordinarily cumbersome recital in Section 13 of the house bill.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.370" offset="13012825">The house conference report on page 23, I am about the middle of the page, it was never the intention of the National Labor Relations Act to preempt the field in this regard, so as to deprive the states of their powers to prevent compulsory unionism to make certain that there should be no question about this, Section 13 was included in the house bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.805" offset="13114598">The conference agreement in Section 14 (b) contains a provision having the same effect, there can't be any doubt I think about the meaning of that statement, having the same effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="4028.827" offset="16218676">I've normally argued very strongly for preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.963" offset="16235186">I've argued that Section 14 (b) should not have been in the statute and if I could have my brothers on either point, I'd be arguing those views now, but it seems to me that the whole history of labor law and the discussion in Congress and the holdings of this Court show that 14 (b) was intended to have the other meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.811" offset="16326614">The question after all came before this Court in 1948 in the Algoma case and the Court squarely held then with the Taft-Hartley debates consideration fresh in it's mind that Section 14 (b) made it even clear than it was under the Wagner Act as the Court put it that the states are left free to pursue their own more restricted causings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.550" offset="16433612">Section 14 (b) was intended to first all the inference that Federal policy was to be exclusive and Justice Black and Justice Douglas dissented chiefly on the ground that the state should not be permitted to punish somebody for carrying out a contract that a Federal Agency had required him during the war to execute.</text>

            <text syncTime="4173.559" offset="16797654">I would like to address myself if I may also we've covered it in the brief to the problem of the Curry case and the problem of the strikes picketing other concerted activities generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.233" offset="16868289">I think I do it best by taking the Curry case Farnsworth Chambers' case on the one side and contrasting it with this case and the Algoma case on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4202.683" offset="16914056">Now both Curry and Farnsworth and Chambers grew out to what essentially was a controversy over union organization's bargaining right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.321" offset="16952613">In Curry the employer was not employing Union labor and had no contract with the building trades in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.847" offset="16982810">There was a dispute over just what the union did say and just why they started picketed and the Florida Courts found that the aim of the Union was to procure the employment of union labor and therefore issued an injunction which this Court reversed and held that the National Board had exclusive jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.001" offset="17075388">Now Farnsworth &amp; Chambers is essentially the same, the same case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.444" offset="17093151">It again was a dispute over union organization in bargaining rights although the precise evidence was a little different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.292" offset="17124498">We think there are three differences between that situation and the situation in this case and in the Algoma case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.207" offset="17168175">In the first place, in a controversy over Union recognition organization bargaining rights, there is a very real chance that the state will interfere with the declared Federal, may I continue a minute Mr. Chief Justice, will interfere with a very carefully written Federal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4293.989" offset="17279352">The Federal statute in Section 7 and 8 guarantee certain rights to engage in concerted activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.337" offset="17312684">It prescribes certain activities but leaves others unregulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.602" offset="17337762">This manifestly was done with considerably subtlety and sensitivity and of course as Mr. Justice Black suggested earlier, the failure to proscribe some kinds of conduct, guarantee of the right to engage with others, implies that what was not proscribed was intended to be left free and that as Justice Jackson said in the Garner case is the fundamental reason for preemption in this area in the absence of some other evidence to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.118" offset="17479868">Second even in those cases there was a sharp controversy about the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.554" offset="17521560">There always is in that in the controversies where there is picketing for organizational purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4361.528" offset="17549458">There have been no formal submitted negotiations and demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="4366.540" offset="17569520">This conflicted testimony and there was a real chance therefore as always a very great likelihood that the state court will come to a different appraisal of the fact than the Federal board and frustrate rights guaranteed by the Federal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.701" offset="17634200">Third there is really in those cases only a remote problem affecting the state's law concerning the execution or application of a collective bargaining realm.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.549" offset="17689579">Union had been recognized, there had been no bargaining, there had been none of the give and talk and sacrificing of the demands that takes place in bargaining, so that the conduct created only a very slight if any danger of frustrating the state policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4415.640" offset="17765961">Now in this case as in the Algoma case one has just the opposite situation, but the contract had been executed its terms are before the Court and indeed in Algoma also apparently not here some one had been discharged under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.554" offset="17841612">Now this case did not go to judgment in the lower Court, the trail Court in favor of the plaintiffs, so we don't know what remedy would have been granted and certainly they are entitled to go back if there is any remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.353" offset="17908799">It seems to me there is not the slightest room for doubt, but that a remedy could be framed which would not interfere in any way with the area of strikes and picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.223" offset="17956237">Indeed the core of the relief they request is a declaratory judgment and the injunction against discharging anyone and an accounting for money's collected which of course is in effect an application of a rule of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4480.111" offset="18023842">It -- there is no real likelihood of interference with strikes at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.721" offset="18050278">So we think that one way of separating the Curry case and that problem from the problem of execution and application of a union security contract is to say yes, the states may deal with the execution and application, but they can't deal with the area of strikes and picketing.</text>

            <text syncTime="4606.543" offset="18529573">The -- there is room for a suggestion that where a union strikes for the purpose of compelling an employer to do something unlawful that there is an anomaly in any rule of law that says, well the state may again punish the employer as he does it, but it cannot do anything to the union that's trying to make him do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4643.328" offset="18676694">Our answer to that is at first that as Justice Stewart said yesterday, if Congress wishes to create such an anomaly that's the end of the myth and there is bound to be under our system of government and particularly in the field of labor management relation, some places where the joints between state law and Federal laws, after all the state laws do apply to some extent to labor unions and the employer and there are always going to be problems in bringing the two together.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.063" offset="18823607">Third, second I guess it is, we would say that the anomaly isn't really very great.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.970" offset="18863208">I have spelled out in my brief that there are remedies in merely all the situations that can be embedded under the National Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4697.916" offset="18895078">So the employer is not going to go save in one very rare case without any protection at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.024" offset="18923499">The third answer on this point I think is that the Court needn't decide here the exact scope of state power in relation to strikes and picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.012" offset="18987447">If the line of distinction I first suggested seemed dubious then there is a second possible line of distinction and that is with the states power extends to the case where the union is unequivocally here and now seeking to compel a violation of state law, but then it does not go back to the more remote sort of thing involved in Curry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4745.426" offset="19085040">I prefer the first time myself with the others, you know, possible one and so that we think that there is no serious danger of conflict or confusion between the state law and the national labor policy in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4765.539" offset="19165497">I am afraid that I have pressed this too much on the Court's time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.866" offset="19182843">I will leave the other issue that the Court raised whether this is a Federal unfair labor practice to submission on our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="4842.802" offset="19474578">The Solicitor relies on the legislative history, but where in the legislative history can he find what he acknowledges to be a correct rule of law that the states cannot interfere with strikes or picketing or other activities seeking to obtain a closed shop or a union shop.</text>

            <text syncTime="5012.493" offset="20153344">What emerged is 14 (b) which definitely ties in to 8 (a) (3) because it says nothing in this Act shall authorize the execution or application of a contract which is violative of state policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5037.364" offset="20252818">Now this in the strongest measure relates 14 (b) to 8 (a) (3) and it seems inconceivable that Congress would have told the states that you could outlaw this as a matter of substance of law and then say that this not an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5060.267" offset="20344456">I think I have demonstrated in my argument, my opening argument of the relationship between Section 14 (b) and 8 (a) (3).</text>

            <text syncTime="5101.470" offset="20509236">The Congress met to integrate that into 8 (a) (3) and that is much a proviso of 8 (a) (3) as every other provision.</text>
