            <text syncTime="30.733" offset="226304">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.082" offset="239679">We're involved here with a case that deals primarily with the construction of an agreement or a contract between an offshore billing contractor and the towage company or the tug company hired by the drilling contractors to move this rig from Pittsburgh-Mississippi to the Port of New Orleans where additional construction could be completed with respect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.643" offset="333928">On the voyage from Pittsburgh to New Orleans, one of the legs of this offshore drilling rig struck the Natchez-Vidalia Bridge crossing the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.008" offset="375411">The trial court found that this collision with the bridge of the -- across the Mississippi River resulted solely and completely from the negligence and the fault of the Crescent Towing and Salvage Company who had supplied the tugs for this towage service.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.448" offset="445210">He predicated this finding of sole fault against Crescent primarily on three grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.029" offset="471437">First of all, that Crescent had negligently failed to supply sufficient power to control the drilling rig at all times during the movement down the Mississippi River, which I submit to this Court was the very essence of its towing contract, supplying of sufficient power to control this rig at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.282" offset="548551">Secondly, the Court imposed liability on Crescent solely in this case because it furnished an unseaworthy tug or an unseaworthy piece of equipment to participate in this activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.726" offset="598288">And the unseaworthiness of it was demonstrated by the fact that at the crucial moment approximately 100 feet upstream from the bridge that the engine on this particular tug failed and reduce the horsepower that was available to control this rig by approximately 600 horsepower.</text>

            <text syncTime="142.591" offset="673729">It ties in -- yes, I think it is except that in considering the exculpatory clauses in the contract, Mr. Justice Stewart, Crescent asked you to relieve them not only of their liability for failing to furnish sufficient power but also of their liability for unseaworthiness of their equipment.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. D. Vickery</label>
            <text syncTime="164.116" offset="759829">The Court found that the engine failed as a matter of law that makes the engine unseaworthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.689" offset="786160">He did not expressly state in his peti -- in his opinion that it was unseaworthy, but I don't believe anyone would dispute the fact, the mere fact that it failed at the crucial time established the unseaworthiness of the engine on this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="193.027" offset="875499">This is no danger to the crew whether if it affects the engine.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.307" offset="888560">The third crucial finding of negligence against Crescent was the fact the evidence in the record demonstrated quite clearly that approximately a mile and a half or two miles upstream from this bridge, there was an adequate amount of water in the river where the tugs could have lowered the legs to the desired depth for 55 feet and tested the ability of these tugs to hold and control this rig before they ever attempted to take it down across the rock way immediately above the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.311" offset="1004648">These were the three principle findings that were made by the district judge in assessing sole fault against the Crescent Towing and Salvage Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="437.416" offset="1853001">Mr. Justice Black, in writing that decision carefully reviewed all of the previous decisions of this Court and concluded that as a result of judicial history but not only because of judicial history but for cogent reasons in support of the route that contracts in which a tug owner attempted to relieve itself of liability for its own negligence would be struck down as invalid because contrary to public policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="586.654" offset="2449951">The language in the Southwestern Sugar and Molasses Company case indicated that they're going to send this clause back to the Interstate Commerce Commission for its consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.795" offset="2502510">But then the Court said if the peculiar hazards involved in towing a barge supplied by the shipper are great and the methods of guarding against those hazards are uncertain, it maybe that in this area, the Court ought to fashion rules to fit particularized circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.114" offset="2579832">Now then, as I read this additional language of Mr. Justice Harlan's opinion in the Southwestern Sugar and Molasses Company case, he didn't say that exceptions ought to be, he said, maybe we ought to have exceptions created to the Bisso rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.019" offset="2635421">But he also attached two conditions precedent to any exception to the Bisso rule and these conditions were first of all that the peculiar hazards involved in towing a barge supplied by the shipper had to be great.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.008" offset="2699368">And secondly, that the methods of guarding against those great and peculiar hazards had to be uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.901" offset="2730924">Now, I don't propose to tell this Court that this in the peculiar looking rig, you have the picture there in the respondent's brief and this is probably a trap to -- a picture of which members of this Court have probably had occasion to see before.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.651" offset="2798007">Certainly, it is an unusual craft, particularly so because of the size of the legs but this, gentlemen, is not any different to my way of thinking as a practical matter in considering a peculiar hazard.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.598" offset="2857775">I don't think that this drilling barge with these three legs on it poses any greater hazard in navigating down to Mississippi and through these bridges than does a tow consisting of some 30 or 40 separate barges that are latched together then maybe in the control of a single tug.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.257" offset="2928410">I don't think the hazards here are any greater or any more peculiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.887" offset="2942934">The danger of collision with the supporting spans of a bridge is ever present anytime a tug and barge passes underneath.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.289" offset="2972505">So I think when it's compared to the other type of traffic that's seen on the Mississippi River that this doesn't particularly represent any unusual hazards that maybe peculiar because this is a peculiarly constructed vessel for the purpose of accomplishing a particular mission.</text>

            <text syncTime="824.393" offset="3400913">And that is that the methods of guarding against the great and peculiar hazards if we assume that these are great and peculiar hazards, has to be uncertain.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.615" offset="3437798">I submit to this Court that there's nothing at all uncertain about the method of preventing any damages such as it has occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.465" offset="3469249">The method of preventing this damage was for Crescent to comply with a very essence of its contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.642" offset="3493909">Supply sufficient seaworthy tugs to control a rig at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.098" offset="3515747">If they had supplied a sufficient amount of horsepower to this rig, they would have been able to stop it completely in the water as they contemplated but as the District Court found this, they wholly failed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.233" offset="3560260">They added an additional 25% of horsepower to go through Baton Rouge Bridge further down the river and they experienced no difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.301" offset="3592547">They did experience difficulty in approaching the Baton Rouge Bridge, however, until they got the extra horsepower but they didn't try to go through Baton Rouge again until they got sufficient horsepower.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.565" offset="3633612">And I think that this is a graphic evidence and a graphic illustration of the fact that Crescent had exclusively within its power the absolute way of preventing or guarding against any hazard of this particular rig striking the bridge.</text>

            <text syncTime="977.001" offset="4011342">So he then started letting the flotilla drift downstream under control of the tugs and then when he was approximately 200 feet upstream from the bridge, he claims that Dixilyn's personnel discovered that they had made a 10-foot error in reading the draft marks on one of the legs and that this could not be discern because of the distances involved and the heights and so forth and that he was not aware of this and that he could not -- being that close to the bridge, he could not again stop the flotilla for the 10 minutes required to prevent it from hitting the bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.061" offset="4159613">I might say he is the only one, he is the only man in the record who testified to that effect in the evidence from everybody else that he did not stop the tow for any period of 20 or 25 minutes is really uncontested except for the testimony of Captain Bretchel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.238" offset="4236309">His version was that an error of Dixilyn had resulted in the legs striking the bridge, but this version of the matter which was Bretchel's all by his self was completely rejected by the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1723.192" offset="6996093">Mr. Vickery has very successfully in his opening put before this Court many of the facts of this case which are not included within this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.535" offset="7041546">The question of whether or not Crescent was negligent, whether or not sufficient horsepower was furnished in this flotilla, whether or not the engine on the tug failed at the critical moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.543" offset="7089507">These questions are not here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.775" offset="7098493">This record has been abbreviated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.614" offset="7105808">The case is here on the petition for certiorari addressed to the Fifth Circuit on two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.377" offset="7128900">The first, the interpretation of the contract and second, assuming that the contract thus purport to shift liability from the tower to the barge whether or not under such circumstances, the barge, rather the contract is valid or invalid under the rule of Bisso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.791" offset="7206536">I might say in answer to Mr. Justice Black's question, I think Mr. Justice Harlan has pointed out the inequity of the answer that Mr. Vickery has given in his opinion in Southwestern Sugar where he says it might be hard to say that public policy demands that the tow should at once have the benefit of a rate so computed and be able to repudiate the correlative obligation of procuring its own insurance with the knowledge that the tow boat maybe required to respond in damages for any injury caused by its negligence despite the agreement to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.861" offset="7362853">Now that if the Court please, is what's happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.020" offset="7375496">These people have gone into a contract knowing the terms of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.077" offset="7399633">With those terms before them and here we split off widely from the position of our opponents, with those terms before them, they signed a contract knowing what it says, but relying because there were bears in the woods if you will on the expert advice of their insurance underwriters because as Mr. Justice Stewart suggested this is of course a case where there are two sets of underwriters fighting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.871" offset="7522826">Incidentally on the question of underwriters and in an answer to the question about whether Bisso would -- the reverse of Bisso would cause a change in rates, it's been my experience that where there is a subrogation waiver or where there is not a subrogation waiver in a marine policy, there is no distinction whatsoever in the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.841" offset="7606732">These rates pretty much stay fixed on physical risk and physical risk does not include the area of recovery over against the towing tug or the negligence of the towing tug.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.242" offset="7660335">This contract, we submit, is a contract which is three-pronged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.028" offset="7683532">First, it provided that the tug should have the benefit of the barge's insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.865" offset="7710804">Second, it provided that in consideration of the performance of this towage at a reduced rate, the barge would not or rather the tug would not be liable to the barge for negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1937.278" offset="7852492">One of these tugs, only one, was owned by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.092" offset="7871718">It subcontracted the chartering of the other two tugs or the procuring of the other two tugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.472" offset="7897213">Those rates are more or less fixed and there was no question involved in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2057.005" offset="8331368">The basic rate is fixed I think on the construction of this vessel whether it's steel or wood, the type of engines, type of service that it will be used in but I think even Mr. Vickery would agree that these questions of whether you can waive subrogation or waive recovery really form very little in the overall rate making theories of underwriters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2099.353" offset="8500746">Bisso purported to say that a straight release of liability where there was a dam barge in tow of a tug could not validly be granted because it tended to cause negligence to become more rife and the second reason was to protect those who needed protection in bargaining from being overreached.</text>

            <text syncTime="3587.843" offset="14454784">The Court says, that means simple negligence only and we will not interpret it to mean willful or wanton negligence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3634.332" offset="14640671">I don't think you have to foresee the particular accident but I think the least that a party in my -- in the position of a drilling barge is entitled to as they have this spelled out in the plainest of language in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.211" offset="14680168">And heretofore, the courts have required the party seeking the exemption to have that spelled out in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.394" offset="14704933">The Fifth Circuit now puts that on the party who is assuming a liability which I think it's getting it in the wrong place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.344" offset="14728756">Now just one other comment if I may and that's with Mr. Kohlmeyer may have left the impression with the Court that it had been known that Cres -- that Dixilyn was going to take its present position that they will spend $40,000 to buy a special trip insurance policy for this particular towage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.467" offset="14805243">I think that I have answered this specifically in my reply when they first solicited this business from Dixilyn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.196" offset="14832201">They told us they had all the hall and P&amp;I Insurance they needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.699" offset="14846203">And if this would guarantee full and maximum efficiency in the towage and he has also implied or possibly has created the impression with the Court that under these circumstances they would have gotten this special policy and they gave Dixilyn a choice of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.263" offset="14904404">This is absolutely incorrect Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.099" offset="14915793">There is nothing in the record that will support this. And let me just read one question and one answer from Crescent's Vice President Smith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.837" offset="14950693">Mr. Kohlmeyer would lead you to believe that they gave Crescent -- Dixilyn a choice of rates and said that if you bear the insurance, it will cost you so much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.619" offset="14981831">If Crescent bares the insurance, it will cost you so much.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.989" offset="14991339">This is a question that was asked to Vice President Smith of Crescent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3725.805" offset="15006595">There was never any quotation or any indication given to Dixilyn of any kind that it would cost them so much to move this rig if they board the [Inaudible] from the insurance and it would cost them so much more if you bore it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.914" offset="15059048">Answer, that question never arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.819" offset="15070647">I submit to the Court that the decision of the Fifth Circuit which creates an exception to Bisso is clearly wrong as it's the refusal of that Court to follow the decisions of five other circuits of this Court and of eight previous decisions of that court interpreting this contract and I submit the case should be reversed to the Fifth Circuit for further consideration of the fact findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.307" offset="15156642">Thank you Your Honors.</text>
