            <text syncTime="19.393" offset="180955">Mr. Lippman</text>

          <turn speaker="s_g_lippman" startTime="23.458" stopTime="616.554">
            <label>Mr. S. G. Lippman</label>
            <text syncTime="23.458" offset="197256">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.028" offset="227453">We are here pursuant to the Court's decision in the first Schermerhorn case decided last June.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.034" offset="283460">The Court there determined that an agency shop arrangement came within the purview of Section 14 (b) of the Labor Act, which permits the states to prohibit certain kinds of compulsory membership arrangements, and that the agency shop arrangement involved violated the state right-to-work law.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.409" offset="425044">The Court, however, left open for argument and for consideration the question of enforcement, namely, whether or not the State of Florida have the power to grant a remedy for the violation of 14 (b) or whether or not this problem was exclusively within the province of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.116" offset="555865">In deciding the Schermerhorn case, the Court recognized the close interrelationship between Section 14 (b) giving the states the power to prohibit union arrangements, and section -- and the proviso of Section 8 (a) (3) of the federal act which setout the scheme under which unions could obtain lawful union shop arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.840" offset="702777">Indeed it was quite clear, the Court recognized that whatever meaning Section 14 (b) has stems from and is related to 8 (a) (3) and because the Court in the GM case determined that an agency shop was within the scope of 8 (a) (3), it had little difficulty in coming to the conclusion that a state operating under 14 (b) similarly could outlaw that kind of an arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.193" offset="856168">Our position is that only the federal government, acting under the Labor Act, has exclusive jurisdiction to remedy the violations involved and our analysis is the one which the Court itself suggested in the Schermerhorn case, namely that without the proviso in 8 (a) (3) any union shop arrangement is unlawful under Section 7 of the Labor Act which broadly guarantees the right of employees to engage in concerted union activities and to join or not to join the union. However, Section 7 says “Except to the extent that any infringement might be authorized under Section 8 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="256.973" offset="1131290">In Section 8 (a) (3), Congress in great details spelled out the conditions and the circumstances under which a union shop could be authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.279" offset="1196492">It pointed out that there must be in the majority of representatives in the appropriate in appropriate bargaining units.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.483" offset="1221256">It initially stated that the union shop arrangement must be specifically authorized by a referendum vote and then three, it pointed out that the kind of union shop arrangement that you could only have.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.502" offset="1305370">Now 14 (b), with obvious reference and relevance to 8 (a) (3), says nothing in this act shall authorize the execution or application of any kind of a union security arrangement, which a state prohibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.965" offset="1395231">It is, therefore, our contention that 14 (b) is as much a proviso to 8 (a) (3) as every other condition which is laid down in 8 (a) (3) and therefore, it can be said that to have a lawfully authorized union shop under 8 (a) (3), you cannot -- you must have such a shop only in a state, which does not prohibit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.626" offset="1561893">If this state prohibits it, you cannot then have a lawfully authorized union shop by the very same reason that if you did not represent a majority of the employees, you could not have a lawful union shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.068" offset="1631692">If in a referendum election the employees do not grant you the right, you could not have a lawful union shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.808" offset="1662621">The action of the state is just another condition and no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.110" offset="1723852">Now, it is the cornerstone of our position that the execution of a union shop arrangement in a right-to-work state constitutes an unfair labor practice pursuant to Section 8 (a) (3) so far as the employer is concerned, and it would be a Section 8 (b) (2) violation so long as the union is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.226" offset="1824266">Now under the Wagner Act, there was no effort to regulate union conduct at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.759" offset="1894379">While there was a provision in Section 8 (3) of that act that unions might negotiate all kinds of union shop arrangements, it was pretty clear and held by this Court in Algoma that this did not mean that there was a right, that the union had any such right.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.158" offset="1975986">As this Court pointed out, it was an expression on non-hostility and it is quite clear and none of the parties here contend otherwise that the entire field of union shops and union security were completely and totally regulated by the states as indeed were most acts of picketing and boycotts and strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.914" offset="2082983">The Wagner Act did not enter that field, and therefore, when this Court was faced with the problem in Algoma as to whether or not the states had authority to prohibit union shops arrangement or closed-shops, the answer was quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.886" offset="2170964">There wasn't any problem of conflict because the Wagner Act did not regulate a thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.775" offset="2190503">It left that area completely to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.982" offset="2207326">There wasn't any problem of having to reconcile federal law with state law and the notion at that point, in the early stages of the development of the preemption doctrines were not fully as – were not as fully developed as they are today following Garmon.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.474" offset="2289246">The concept which the Court looked upon as controlling was the concept of an actual conflict or overlapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.123" offset="2331878">The Court was not concerned then as I believe it is now, with the question of whether or not arguably this is a protected activity or arguably whether this is a prohibited act.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.859" offset="2386840">And therefore the very same question would arise today.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.094" offset="2403767">I believe the Court's notion would be on a different posture, in a different plane, because I believe it would take the attitude and the point of view that's expressed in Garmon rather than the early attitude which was expressed in Algoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.517" offset="2501465">As I pointed out when Congress passed the Taft-Hartley law, the situation changed radically.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.845" offset="2530722">There you have the most detailed regulation of the union shop that perhaps any country has ever undertaken.</text>

            <text syncTime="660.797" offset="2746598">Algoma merely said there was a violation of the Wagner Act -- that was not a violation of the Wagner Act and that the states had the authority to do it, to regulate the field involved and that there was nothing in 14 (b) which it could see which in any way suspended the state's power in this area.</text>

            <text syncTime="766.862" offset="3170826">Well no the case arose before Taft-Hartley, but was decided after Taft-Hartley.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.232" offset="3208338">It arose under the Taft-Hartley but the case was not decided until sometime in 1947 just after Taft-Hartley law was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.524" offset="3245432">I am sorry sir of my vagueness of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.896" offset="3266957">Now, I started to say when the federal government laid down this detailed prescription regulating affirmatively the conditions under which a union shop could be obtained and impliedly said that a closed-shop was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.232" offset="3352325">There was apprehension that this regulation of the union shop picture might completely wipe out any state policy on the map as indeed I think it was a proper and a rational apprehension, and therefore to make sure that state policy would be considered and would be effective, indeed would be controlling in the adjudications under Section 8 (a) (3), 14 (b) was written into the law, making it quite clear that nothing in the Act would authorize the execution of a union shop or any other kind of union or any other kind of a union security arrangement where the state outlaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.054" offset="3615640">This was no different than saying that before you can have the union shop in the first instance, the employees in a plant must vote for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.906" offset="3655032">If they vote against it, you can't have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.371" offset="3664854">So they decided that the employees' choice would be important.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.168" offset="3680005">Congress also recognizes the tremendous feelings on this subject in the states and therefore said, “Similarly if the state determines that it is against its policy that too would invalidate any efforts to obtain a union shop.”</text>
            <text syncTime="921.369" offset="3788884">So what we have here really is not state policy or the Congress or the federal government supporting itself to the state, but actual federal policy because the state can only enact these laws pursuant to the grant by the federal authority, and that it is a very limited grant, but the law in the states act it fills out the area of Section 8 (a) (3).</text>
            <text syncTime="958.636" offset="3937886">Now, if my analysis is correct that a violation of state right-to-work law constitutes an unfair labor practice, I would then think that would just about end the problem because I think all of the preemption cases would require this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.560" offset="4061602">The government, however, does not concede that it is an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.305" offset="4104547">On the other hand it recognizes and states quite candidly that the interpretation leading to the conclusion that it is unfair labor practice is warranted and is supportive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.026" offset="4171525">The government relies however on the legislative history which it thinks it's somewhat clearer than the actual enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.881" offset="4238921">The government, however, does not -- is unable to reconcile this Court's determinations in Curry and in Farnsworth &amp; Chambers where this Court determined that with respect to strikes and pickets, seeking a closed-shop that the states were preempted and that the states had no authority to enter this field.</text>
