            <label>Mr. Richard Tinsman</label>
            <text syncTime="9.075" offset="139682">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.902" offset="146996">This is a case involving the question of a former jeopardy and the sole issue presented here is the question of jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.880" offset="186911">The petitioner was convicted by the Federal District Court for the Western District of Texas on six counts of an indictment which charged conspiracy, to steal, forge, and pass United States Government checks, forging and passing two of those three checks and passing the third one.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.118" offset="259845">He was convicted and an appeal was made to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit on the sole ground of former jeopardy and the opinion was affirmed -- conviction was affirmed and here, we are appealing on that sole ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.809" offset="314598">As the Court of Appeals stated in their opinion, the facts are undisputed and very simple in relation to the jeopardy question.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.975" offset="355244">The petitioner was arraigned before the Court without jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.497" offset="385337">Then sometime later, both sides were called and announced ready for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.685" offset="406131">A jury was selected in the morning and the jury was instructed to return in the afternoon at two o’clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.290" offset="432567">Then sometime before two o'clock, apparently an out of court conference in the judge's chambers was had between the prosecutor and the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.474" offset="465272">And at two o'clock, the Court announced in open court without the jury being in the room that the Government had informed him that a witness as to count six and seven which involved one check was absent and that the Court was going to discharge the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.121" offset="535907">The defendant's counsel objected, asked that the Court proceed on the other four counts for which the prosecution admittedly had enough witnesses to convict; the Court overruled this motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.063" offset="583659">The defense counsel then moved to dismiss the counts six and seven for which there was -- the evidence was not available, the Court overruled this motion, and discharged the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.025" offset="627440">Two days later, apparently, the missing witness was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.416" offset="644995">And another panel was called, another jury was selected, and this jury convicted the petitioner on all six counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.603" offset="685746">A plea of former jeopardy was interposed before the second trial which was overruled by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.035" offset="715525">So we are here today on the question, because it was developed in the trial that the only reason that the first jury was discharged was because the prosecutor didn't have a witness and this witness had not even been served with subpoena.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.254" offset="780413">But the prosecutor had failed to check with the U.S. marshal's office directly across the hall from his own before he selected the jury, and before he announced ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.377" offset="936835">But he just didn't make any check and the subpoena was not served; he announced ready and then found that during the noon hour and then the Court discharged the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="557.552" offset="2333550">[Attempt to Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="566.286" offset="2368554">Actually in this field, there are three important cases that we consider vital and that's the Cornero case decided in 1931 by the Ninth Circuit, the Gori case that this Court decided in June of 1961, in a five to four decision where Mr. Justice Frankfurter wrote the majority opinion and Mr. Justice Douglas wrote the dissent, and the Perez case decided by this Court in 1824.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.499" offset="2477328">Now, the Cornero case, of course, is the -- actually the strongest case that petitioner has.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.737" offset="2502301">In this case, the defendant was charged just a one count indictment with conspiracy to “possess and transport” intoxicating liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.325" offset="2540648">He was indicted with three other co-defendants and they had all plead guilty at a previous -- previous hearing and they were out on their bond and their bond required them to return when the trial of the fourth defendant, Cornero, came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.897" offset="2598954">And so the prosecutor announced ready on the assumption that these other defendants would not forfeit their bond and would appear since they‘d already plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.879" offset="2634898">On the day of the trial, the witnesses didn't show up.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.814" offset="2650676">And so the prosecutor announced that he wasn't ready and in this case, Cornero asked for a continuance and they went out and tried to find the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.936" offset="2683068">Well they got continuances for five days and they still couldn't find them so the judge dismissed the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.491" offset="2705324">Two years later, they finally found them.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.730" offset="2714311">So they brought Cornero back; they've picked another jury, he was convicted, and he appealed aptly a former jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.422" offset="2741060">The Ninth Circuit held he had been placed in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.851" offset="2754748">And the language of the Ninth Circuit is particularly significant, and we would like to call it to the attention of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.230" offset="2784319">It said the fact is that when the District Attorney empanelled the jury without first ascertaining whether or not his witnesses were present, he took a chance, this appears in page 7 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.507" offset="2833429">There is no difference in principle between the discovery by the District Attorney immediately after the jury was empanelled that his evidence was insufficient and the discovery after he'd call some or all of his witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.411" offset="2889017">So we say that the Cornero case is similar that this was after the first jury was picked, no evidence was put on, the witnesses weren't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.898" offset="2922977">The jury was discharged and he was tried and convicted by a different jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.001" offset="2939382">Now, the Government points out in this case, it's virtually on all force, the Government devotes only one paragraph to it on page 33 and 34 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.178" offset="2976057">And their only method of distinction it says, it says, “In a realistic sense, it could be said that the Government proceeded the trial without his evidence in Cornero, but in this case on the other hand, the Government was not preceding the trial without knowing that it had the witnesses to prove its case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="733.064" offset="3035617">Well frankly, we do not see the distinction the Government makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.343" offset="3048782">The only essential distinction is that there was two days rather than two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.069" offset="3071666">And we say that this is not a meaningful distinction in the concept of jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.637" offset="3093922">The Gori case test is not the test of harassment which apparently the Government on page 39 would indicate that the test in jeopardy cases are.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.532" offset="3141465">The Gori case indicated that they specifically said, “We will not anticipate the situation in which a judge exercises his authority to help the prosecution at a trial in which its case is going badly by affording in another more favorable opportunity to convict the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.738" offset="3214294">Well, in this case, it's our position that in a sense, this is exactly what the Court did, and the Government was not ready, it couldn't convict on count six and seven and so the judge gave it a new -- another chance to convict not only on both counts, but on all of the other counts in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.095" offset="3287751">Now, I think it's also significant to look at Justice Douglas' language in the dissent where he says that, “Once a jury has been empanelled and sworn, jeopardy attaches and a subsequent prosecution is barred if a mistrial is ordered, absent the showing of imperious necessity.”</text>
            <text syncTime="815.330" offset="3364655">The prosecution must stand or fall on its performance at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.844" offset="3386702">I do not see how a mistrial directed because the prosecution has no witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.995" offset="3403316">It's different from a mistrial directed because the prosecutor abuses his office and is guilty of misconduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="844.309" offset="3480639">This is a slightly harder question but on theory, I don' think it would, Your Honor, because I think the basic proposition is whether you‘re giving this -- the Government a chance to go ahead and pick the entire jury, didn't look and see what kind of a jury they‘re getting and then elect.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.844" offset="3534764">Well, we got one witnesses to a few counts of this multi-count indictment so we'll get a new jury as to the whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.965" offset="3559215">The Government in this case could have gone ahead and tried the defendant on those four counts that they were ready on, they elected not to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.533" offset="3589517">They could have requested a continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.603" offset="3597772">They elected not to do so, and use the same jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.348" offset="3612714">And we feel that when the Government asked for a discharge of the jury, well, the Court grants one rather than getting a continuance after announcing ready, I don't think the mere swearing of the jury is anything once they‘ve seen who all the jurors are and the strikes have been announced, and the 12 people have been picked, I think that's the essential thing as far as reasoning goes but of course we don‘t have to consider that here because the jury was sworn.</text>

            <text syncTime="923.141" offset="3795884">Second trial they used six.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.942" offset="3811140">The Government -- the Government of course relies on the Perez case and particularly on the broad language of the Perez case where it states that the law has invested courts of justice with authority to discharge a jury from giving any verdict whenever in their opinion taking all its circumstances into consideration there is a manifest necessity for the act or the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.166" offset="3923989">I think that this broad language of Perez which is also quoted in Gori is something that is used sometimes out of context because of course Perez was only a case which established that a hung jury did not result in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.926" offset="3983026">And it's particularly significant that while the Government says that the manifest -- the ends of public justice should be a consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.496" offset="4017403">In effect, the Fifth Circuit said it should be the only consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.528" offset="4033494">On page 40 of the record, they wrote that Perez held that a judge may discharge a jury within sound discretion without operating as an acquittal when the ends of public justice require it.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.843" offset="4086784">But we say that the Fifth Circuit is just -- by that language saying that the discretion as to -- the question of jeopardy is completely within the discretion of the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.565" offset="4129625">And we think that it is not -- if there is some limits on the trial court's discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.923" offset="4155016">And we think one of them is that when the trial court declares a mistrial, purely to help the prosecution prove its case against the defendant that in that case, the jeopardy does attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.528" offset="4201514">Now, we'd like to say one thing about the Government's contentions in their brief that seemed rather odd to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.102" offset="4227741">On page 31 of their brief, they state, “However the fact the jeopardy may have attached does not however compel a reversal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.060" offset="4259610">On page 32, they say, “The prior jeopardy in this case was jeopardy only in the most technical sense of the term, but it's our opinion that jeopardy is jeopardy and it's like saying that somebody is just a little bit pregnant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.117" offset="4315826">There just isn‘t any in between and in fact on page 7 of their brief they say, “Contrary to petitioner's contention, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not impose a fixed rule that once a defendant has been placed in jeopardy, he cannot be brought before a second jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.708" offset="4386252">They cite no case for this and it's our contention that this is the very question this Court must decide is whether or not, the defendant was placed in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.190" offset="4432123">The legal sense of jeopardy is in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution and that's the real question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.683" offset="4462111">Not whether he was in technical jeopardy or any other kind of jeopardy but whether he was in jeopardy at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.102" offset="4487816">Now, I would like to comment on the case of Wade versus Hunter that Mr. Justice Black decided that the Government relies on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.945" offset="4515192">This was a case involving unforeseen circumstances as it was clearly shown by the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.090" offset="4539747">A court marital of the defendant was recessed because of a tactical situation of the army in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.930" offset="4563048">The army had moved forward, the witnesses were not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.412" offset="4577050">And the Court held that this was such a case of unforeseen circumstances that jeopardy would not attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.238" offset="4612368">We are not saying that the Government sets up a strong man and in effect and they say with the petitioners contending for a rule like -- of Cornero that whenever a jury is discharged after it is empanelled and sworn, the jeopardy attaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.916" offset="4667016">That is not our position at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.320" offset="4676629">Our position on page 13 of our brief is that jeopardy attaches when there is an imperious necessity, unforeseen circumstances or the mistrial has been granted in the sole interest of the defendant as it was in Gori, but in here, none of that exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.371" offset="4736815">There were no unforeseen circumstances that the prosecutor couldn't have found out if he'd exercised the least diligence whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.862" offset="4778820">There was no doing just for the interest of the defendant; it was purely for the interest of the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.881" offset="4806928">And finally, there was no imperious necessity that this be done again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.674" offset="4826049">The cases that have held that are -- and that jeopardy did not attach are cases were something that couldn't be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.063" offset="4859591">A hung jury, for example, is an unforeseen circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.053" offset="4875577">Now, we're not actually trying to change the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.908" offset="4886967">We cite in our brief, the Shoemaker case which was decided in 1840 and one of the old federal cases and this says, “However guilty the defendant may be, he can only be convicted according to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.923" offset="4943078">And a jury having been sworn to try his case, he has a right to their verdict unless some inevitable occurrence shall interpose and prevent the rendition of a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.442" offset="4981112">Before he goes to trial, the prosecutor should see that his witnesses are in attendance and that he is prepared to try any issue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.191" offset="5012146">This was as far back as 1840.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.220" offset="5024266">He also cites the Watson case in 1868.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.617" offset="5037850">So we are saying that here, the law is that a mistrial, because the Government has no witnesses as to a few counts of a multi-count indictment for which the prosecutor could have found out that he didn't have witnesses before he announced ready, is something that places the defendant in jeopardy. This falls within none of the exceptions of the jeopardy rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.599" offset="5137742">Now, the second point is, well -- what should the law be?</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.460" offset="5157177">Because as we saw on Monday, the Court can change the law as they changed Betts and Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.822" offset="5182673">We feel that there's no question that this is the way that the law should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.654" offset="5209945">This -- the alternatives were very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.717" offset="5218200">The Court could have simply declared the continuance, told the jury to go home, come back whenever they found the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.415" offset="5241083">They found him two days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.630" offset="5245889">The Court stated in page 10 of the transcript, “We expect to give you a trial this week.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.489" offset="5273370">There was no necessity for discharging this jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.111" offset="5291865">We feel that the basic vice in this is that it opens, although in this case there was no abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.104" offset="5319764">We are not saying that the prosecutor was hiding this witness out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.741" offset="5334288">But that this case, if it is affirmed, opens the door to abuse, opens the door to a government prosecutor in an important case to have one witness as to one or two counts of a multi-count indictment, some place without a subpoena served on them and then if he gets a jury that is unsatisfactory, go to the Court and say, “We can't locate this witness.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.018" offset="5423417">We would like this jury discharged and another one had and here's the authority for Downum versus Unites States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.564" offset="5449644">And we say that when you open that risk of judicial arbitrariness that Justice Douglas talked about in the opinion in Gori, that this is something that shouldn't be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.221" offset="5556224">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.837" offset="5574719">In 1949, Mr. Justice Black, speaking for a majority of this Court in Wade against Hunter had this to say with respect to the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.733" offset="5622262">It does not mean that every time a defendant is put to trial before a competent tribunal, he is entitled to go free if the trial fails to end in a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.136" offset="5659878">Such a rule would create an insuperable obstacle to the administration of justice in many cases in which there is no semblance, the type of oppressive practices at which the double jeopardy prohibition is aimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.775" offset="5706480">Some years earlier, Justice Cardozo speaking for this Court in the Palko case warned that the tyranny of labels must not lead us to lead to a conclusion that a word which in one set of facts may stand for oppression or enormity is of like the fact in every other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.387" offset="5772936">Justice Cardozo was there again speaking about the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.862" offset="5794774">The petitioner in this case would have this Court adopt a very rigid and inflexible rule which under some circumstances would always mean that after the discharge of a jury, the defendant had been in prior jeopardy so that he could not be again tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.977" offset="5859244">The rule might be stated simply as this, “The absence of a government witness never justifies the discharge of a jury and the retrial of the defendant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.021" offset="5899473">That is the rule which the Court in Cornero, in the Ninth Circuit handed down in 1931.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.380" offset="5924864">The reason why the Government in its brief in this case did not spend much time discussing Cornero is because that rule was vigorously urged upon this Court in Wade against Hunter, specifically urged and specifically rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.502" offset="5985364">And quoting again from Mr. Justice Black's opinion in that case, we are asked to adopt the Cornero rule on which -- under which petitioner contends the absence of a witness can never justify discontinuance of a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.650" offset="6041997">Such a rigid formula is inconsistent with the guiding principles of the Perez doctrine to which we adhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.852" offset="6066761">So this Court has had this argument before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.170" offset="6076061">This question as to whether or not, Cornero sets the rule which should be followed by this Court and it has specifically adopted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.394" offset="6104900">Now, I'd like to view this case from four aspects, which I think are very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.705" offset="6130186">First of all is that – in this case the jury was discharged before it even assembled to hear the case, before opening statements had been made, before witnesses were sworn or any testimony heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.366" offset="6180864">Secondly, no prejudice whatsoever resulted to the defendant in this case in being tried by a different jury two days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.215" offset="6212211">In fact, there is no claim of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.745" offset="6222346">And thirdly, that the culpability of the prosecutor in producing the circumstances which caused the Court in this case to discharge the jury to the extent that it existed at all was slight understandable and excusable as I will develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.249" offset="6288384">And fourth and finally, when the Court in this case discharged the jury, he was acting in an area in which this Court has time and again says it has wide and broad discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.445" offset="6337181">I don't believe that discretion should be disturbed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.878" offset="6362885">Going to the first point which I mentioned, the fact that this jury was discharged before it had even assembled to hear the case, I'd like to compare this case with some of the other cases in which this Court has dealt with this problem of whether or not jeopardy attaches following a mistrial so as to prevent the retrial of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.173" offset="6440103">I might say parenthetically at this point that this question appears to have been before this Court on seven different occasions and in each of these occasions, the right of the retrial was upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.632" offset="6485870">In the first such case, the Perez case decided in 1828, we have the classic example of the hung jury and the Court, this Court for the first time held that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment did not prevent the Government from retrying a defendant under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.449" offset="6557132">A later case in 1949 is Wade against Hunter to which I have already referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.716" offset="6578239">This is the court-martial case where one of the members of the Third Army during the war was charged with the rape of a German citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.368" offset="6608854">The case was fully tried before the court-martial and was submitted on the evidence and it was under consideration by the Court-Martial Board when the Board itself decided they wanted to hear additional evidence, it wanted to hear the testimony of the mother and father of the victim, which may be presumed was for the benefit of the prosecution in that case are operated to the benefit of the prosecution in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.608" offset="6701850">When it became apparent that the military situation made it somewhat impractical or difficult, certainly not impossible to obtain these testimonies since these witnesses were about 75 miles away from the scene of the court-martial, the Commanding General of the Third Army ordered that the Board be dismissed and the case was again heard by another Court-Martial Board of the Fifteenth Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.121" offset="6787845">That Board convicted and on appeal to this Court following habeas corpus proceedings, this Court reviewed the entire proceeding and held that under those circumstances, the defendant had not been placed in jeopardy so as to prevent his retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.157" offset="6848031">This Court did not specifically decide whether or not the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment applied to court-martials, but it did decide that even if it -- even if they were applicable, it had not been violated under the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.242" offset="6908322">Now, I submit that any rule of law – that if the rule of law permits a defendant to be tried twice, maybe three times or more after a jury has heard all the evidence in the case for and against him but he's not able to agree on a verdict, it would be a most incongruous result to say that the law prevents under the circumstances of this case the defendant from being tried even once on the -- for the offenses charged in the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.538" offset="7025560">Second point I would like to discuss is the fact that no prejudice has been shown in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.313" offset="7048652">There is no claim of prejudice as Mr. Tinsman has pointed out in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.606" offset="7073834">There was some suggestion in the petitioner's brief that perhaps the first jury might have been more favorable than the second jury, but that the plea of jeopardy should not depend upon whether or not he can prove that point since he's not susceptible to proof and I agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.992" offset="7127333">He's not susceptible to proof and whether or not one jury would be more favorable than another jury I think is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.502" offset="7153351">Neither the Government nor the defendant is entitled to a favorable jury, only a jury which is fair and impartial and this record does not suggest in any way that the Gov -- that the jury which tried the defendant was in any way not fair or impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.376" offset="7216880">Moreover, as was indicated in counsel's argument, neither side in this case apparently took much time in the selection of the jury nor did the composition of the jury seem to be of great importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.912" offset="7267035">So I don't think that we have any element of prejudice whatsoever in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.958" offset="7287202">The third point I would like to discuss is the culpability of the prosecutor, if any there was, in producing the circumstances which cause the Court in this case to discharge the jury which had been first sworn to try the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.561" offset="7349582">On Wednesday or Thursday, a week before these proceedings occurred, the United States Attorney's Office was notified by the Court, 12 cases were going to be called for trial on Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.604" offset="7397752">At that time the record reveals there were two assistants available to try cases in United States Attorney's Office in San Antonio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.692" offset="7434115">The Assistant United States Attorney who did try this case, Mr. McDonald, stated that he had to issue more than 100 subpoenas between the time he received this notice in Monday of the week in which these proceedings occur.</text>

            <text syncTime="3676.043" offset="14807542">If the Court reverses this case, the only thing it will be saying is that Government prosecutors must ascertain whether not their witnesses are served with the subpoena before they announce ready for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.670" offset="14858010">And if they announce ready for trial, and then find that their witnesses aren't present as to some count of a multi-count indictment, they cannot secure a discharge of the jury without putting the defendant in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.910" offset="14919032">And once this case has decided that way, I don't think any government prosecutors will the mistake that Mr. McDonald and the Court made in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.567" offset="14957589">The -- much of the argument was devoted to this excusable nature of what the prosecutor did, but I think it's implicit from the record.</text>
