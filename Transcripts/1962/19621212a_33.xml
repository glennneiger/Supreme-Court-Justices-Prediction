            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 62, Northern National Gas Company, Appellant, versus State Corporation Commission of the State of Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.151" offset="167999">Oh, I beg you -- I beg your pardon.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.282" offset="184508">Oh -- oh!</text>
            <text syncTime="20.756" offset="186389">Yes, of course, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.913" offset="223065">Number 33, Incres Steamship Company Limited, Petitioner, versus International Maritime Workers Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.267" offset="260472">I was led astray by the Solicitor General's brief, the discussion of that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.987" offset="295372">Mr. McAllister, you may proceed now.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="breck_p_mcallister" startTime="51.005" stopTime="1255.952">
            <label>Mr. Breck P. Mcallister</label>
            <text syncTime="51.005" offset="307388">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.298" offset="332570">This case has been adverted too already but I should like to state the facts in it because I do not believe they've been fully stated as yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.270" offset="376456">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals of the State of New York to review the judgment of that Court dismissing the complaint herein on the ground that the subject matter of the action was arguably subject to the National Labor Relations Board and the National Labor -- the Labor Act under the rule of this Court in the Garmon case.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.524" offset="497455">Now, this action is a civil action in part in the state court seeking both damages and an injunction against the intentional interference by the respondent union with the internal order in business and property of the plaintiff company.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.658" offset="590033">The plaintiff in this case is a foreign corporation, a Liberian corporation, fully owned by Italian nationals, resident in Italy and the officers and directors are also Italians, resident in Italy.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.571" offset="649697">The defendant below is the International Maritime Workers Union which was jointly formed by the two leading American Seamen's Unions, the National Maritime Union and Seafarers' International Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.373" offset="716884">It was organized as its Constitution provides for the stated purpose of organizing and representing the foreign seamen on certain types of foreign-flag vessels and the type referred to is those whose ultimate ownership and control has no substantial connection with the country of registry.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.029" offset="835480">Now the ships that are involved here are two in number, the Nassau and the Victoria.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.203" offset="864214">Both were built in England -- I am sorry, one was built in England, and one was built in Ireland.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.050" offset="891591">Both are registered in Liberia and by the Liberian flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.150" offset="911966">Both have almost entirely Italian cruise recruited in Genoa and they signed -- I have to make a minor correction of the Solicitor General's statement of my Incres case.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.600" offset="969749">They signed Liberian articles, seamen's articles in the presence of the Liberian Council in Genoa.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.782" offset="1014471">The officers are licensed by the Republic of Liberia.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.562" offset="1037667">The articles stand approved by an Italian union and the record shows that a large proportion of the crew belong to this Italian union.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.900" offset="1094928">The ships are engaged in the Caribbean cruise trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.649" offset="1129932">The Nassau makes a weekly trip to British West Indies for some 30 weeks each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.815" offset="1162637">The Victoria likewise makes cruises to Caribbean ports during a period of about the same length, about seven months every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.092" offset="1207777">Both ships return to Genoa each year for refitting and for leave for the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.458" offset="1241213">The company in New York City maintains an agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.112" offset="1267858">The agent is a wholly owned subsidiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.390" offset="1276949">It is a New York corporation and this agent, like other agents of steamship lines, sells tickets and takes care of the arrival and departure of the ships and the passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.525" offset="1345494">The corporation, the foreign corporation also employs another New York corporation known as Cosmopolitan Shipping Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.305" offset="1380603">Like other foreign lines, this Cosmopolitan Shipping Corporation is known as a ship's husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.307" offset="1412577">This takes care of such matters as the physical ending of the ship, the fueling of the ship between trips, the hiring of tugboats and linesmen, and pilots, and docking, and all such physical features in the handling of a ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.538" offset="1485511">Now the lawsuit below began when the respondent union commenced a campaign under its Constitution to organize the seamen on these ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.701" offset="1546219">This campaign began in February of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.213" offset="1568266">The overt incidence in this case began on Friday the 13th of May of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.796" offset="1614555">The respondent union has admitted in its answer in the case -- in this case that on May 13th, the union representatives requested crew members of the SS Nassau to engage in this freight and indeed they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.643" offset="1697938">The Nassau arrived on the morning of May 13th at about quarter of 9 with the load of passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.395" offset="1732942">The passengers were debarked.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.571" offset="1741615">By eleven o'clock, there was a picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.820" offset="1758647">The crew takes its leave normally from 12 until four o'clock in the afternoon when again a new load of passengers comes on board for the scheduled of departure at six o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.083" offset="1811728">The crews are under articles and under duty to return at four o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.210" offset="1836178">They did.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.245" offset="1844328">But then as when the activities of the union began and it appears in the record that they actually went on board the ship and urged the crew members to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.870" offset="1894902">The crew members did and to abbreviate the story, now all of the crew members did but a substantial number did.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.659" offset="1930010">To abbreviate this part of the story, the cruise was cancelled by midnight.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.884" offset="1954879">The crew did not return.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.435" offset="1969089">The other ship, the Victoria, arrived in New York harbor on Sunday the 15th of May.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.102" offset="1999809">There was a minor incident in the outer harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.844" offset="2010781">The Victoria was unable to dock because the Nassau occupied the pier to which it was accustomed to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.136" offset="2047875">So, it laid anchor in the outer harbor in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.237" offset="2072325">Efforts to unload the returning passengers by tender were interfered with by a picket boat of the respondent union but a police launched took care of that situation evidently and at any rate the passengers were debarked and there was no further incident on that occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.771" offset="2150484">The real difficulty began with the Victoria on the following Tuesday when the Victoria again was scheduled to depart on another cruise.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.926" offset="2203042">The passengers have been embarked by tender as the ship still laid anchor at quarantine in the harbor.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.867" offset="2246823">The departure which had originally been scheduled for four o'clock in the afternoon had been postponed until 5:30 due to the problem of getting the passengers on board.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.777" offset="2290500">When the passengers were on board and again the crew, under articles -- I mean by that they were on duty, the -- was prepared to sail.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.329" offset="2336684">Again, a picket boat came out, this time it was manned by members of the crew of the Nassau.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.833" offset="2370748">But the record is clear that this picket boat was sent out by a Mr. Levangie (ph), the chief picket of this union and was sent out for the very purpose that was sought to be carried out and it was successfully accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.977" offset="2443264">A picket boat called through loud speakers in Italian to the Italian crew members and urged them to feign sickness and not to sail.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.250" offset="2488404">This had its effect of creating confusion on shipboard and there ensued many conversations on the shipboard which I need not detail with the same result as in the case of the Nassau that the Victoria did not sail on its cruise and it was cancelled, and the passengers were debarked by tender.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.957" offset="2603238">Now, this proceeding was as I've said in thought in the state court to seek an injunction and indeed a restraining order was obtained on Monday, the day before the Victoria incident but it apparently did not stop the activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.053" offset="2695607">A permanent injunction issued on May 25th and the matter is now here.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.222" offset="2728312">The federal question was raised below at the outset by the respondent union by cross motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the state court had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit in view of the Federal Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.158" offset="2808038">That point has of course been pressed in every -- all the way out here.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.889" offset="2838967">The question presented are of course and very obviously the Garmon rule by the state court correctly applied that rule, we contend that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.180" offset="2880136">And of course, more basically the question of whether or not the Federal Act applies at all to the foreign seamen employed by a foreign corporation are unknown on these ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.196" offset="2972191">These men of course were I repeat, was serving under foreign article which were entered abroad and the ships were of course in territorial waters at the time of these events.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.361" offset="3036766">Now, I certainly do not wish to repeat so many of the arguments that have been made here already, many of which have a direct bearing upon the Incres case.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.383" offset="3092877">I want to emphasize, perhaps, three parts, maybe a few more.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.860" offset="3122761">First, I find myself in very fine company.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.504" offset="3149406">I find the Solicitor General is on my side.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.715" offset="3162258">I find that five foreign governments have filed briefs in the Incres case and in the related cases, all of which are also, I think on my side.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.109" offset="3223803">That is a very welcome situation and I think the presence of so many foreign governments, ones against any hasty conclusion that this Act should be construed without full regard to the interests of the foreign nations that are before this Court in the amicus briefs because -- and I join the Solicitor General in one basic and fundamental point he made.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.321" offset="3356609">We are concerned not with the Garmon type of situation of this Court acting as the -- what has been called the empire of our federal system in adjusting jurisdiction between state and nation but we are quite the contrary engaged in the adjustment if you like of power between sovereign nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.542" offset="3461517">And the presence of these -- the governments, I think it must again be emphasized.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.133" offset="3499865">And as the Solicitor General pointed out only one nation may properly, effectively, if you like, regulate labor relations on shipboard.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.747" offset="3542392">And here, we are concerned not with a tort law such as in the Jones Act where there is a choice of law in the private international sense that we are concerned with a comprehensive regulatory law that reaches into the most important relationship on shipboard to wit the relation between the master and the crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.044" offset="3667571">We regard the Benz decision as controlling here in every respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.341" offset="3700694">Frankly, I do not believe that the distinction attempted by my worthy opponent is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.070" offset="3739669">The suggestion is that in that case, the ship was only temporarily in a United States port but as Mr. Justice Black, I think inquired earlier, isn't every foreign ship that comes to our harbors in here temporarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.089" offset="3811767">I believe they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.646" offset="3817932">I think the reach of that decision is far deeper than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.757" offset="3842382">The important point that I think I should like to stress is that the Benz case is in full conformity with the established principles of international law under which we have lived for so long.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.179" offset="3936110">I would like to mention that because several suggestions have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.493" offset="3953351">One is sort of the notion that there is some fiction maybe about registration under the flag of Liberia.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.926" offset="3991071">And secondly, the suggestion that there is some, perhaps some -- even the word fiction was used in connection with the matter of registry of a ship in Liberia, I think, and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.084" offset="4063692">I would like to point out that the Republic of Liberia has filed a brief here in which in its -- in the Appendix, it has listed the international conventions to which the Republic of Liberia is a signatory power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.705" offset="4150209">This appears in Appendix A to the brief of the Republic of Liberia on page 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.604" offset="4185840">They have listed eight international conventions: The Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization, The International Convention Safety of Life at Sea, International Load Line Convention, International Telecommunication Convention, North Atlantic Ice Patrol, The ILO Convention relating to officers, competencies, certificates, the ILO Convention relating to shipowners' liability, relating to sick and injured seamen and the ILO Convention relating to minimum age at sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.457" offset="4373191">I most respectably -- respectfully submit that the Republic of Liberia is a recognized maritime power and its laws are entitled to the same recognition that all the laws of any -- of a sovereign nation that may come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.348" offset="4468799">I would add that the conventions to which I referred relate to the ships themselves, the control regulation exercised by the Republic over those ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.417" offset="4517073">I would refer also to the statement in the brief of the Republic of Liberia that they recognized the duty to regulate and control all matters of employment and in relation to the internal management of Liberian ships and that it does regulate these matters and has what is stated in this brief to be a growing body of law with respect to minimum age, working hours, overtime wages, maintenance and care of sick and injured seamen, repatriation, and unionization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.889" offset="4702960">I most respectfully submit again that in this area, the Republic of Liberia being one of the four largest maritime nations in the world has and is recognizing its obligations in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.118" offset="4767848">And I believe there should be accorded to it before this Court exactly the same recognition as would be accorded to any other nation that comes before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.820" offset="4822601">I emphasize that because there has been some suggestions that there was something peculiar about registration under the law of that Republic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.250" offset="4876413">Frankly, I haven't the remotest this idea while these Italian owners chose to register these ships under the Republic -- flag of the Republic of Liberia but I suppose that's a decision, a business decision which they are entitled to make for whatever reasons may appeal to them and I do not believe that that decision is subject to criticism or review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.228" offset="4976306">Many individual much capital in the world of one nation is registered under the flag of some other nation, in ships under the flag of some other nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.569" offset="5033671">American capital does it, British capital does it, Greeks do it, Norwegians do it, it is been going on for a very long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.754" offset="5078392">I sometimes think that Columbus did it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1712.634" offset="6953880">We think in the words of Mr. Manoli that the Labor Board has no business here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.078" offset="6975718">In other words, we do not recognize the basic primary right of an American union to seek to organize the seamen on a foreign-flag ship, the foreign seaman on a foreign-flag ship or to represent them, to intrude into the internal affairs of these ships by bargaining with these men, with the owners of these ships, or to do anything in that direction, and the court below, the New York court, found that the acts of this union were illegal and tortious under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.176" offset="7140080">And I should like to call the attention of the Courts to the decision of the Appellate Division here which was reversed on the preemption ground but a decision that has been followed in a later case and represents the law of New York as to the illegality of this conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.461" offset="7221164">We argue that this was tortuous and the Court so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.643" offset="7245928">It declared the Appellate Division in this case that the striking or other interference with the internal management of the crew of the vessel, away from its own port was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.788" offset="7302562">And I should like to call the attention of the Court to the fact that the Appellate Division relied upon the decision of this Court in the Southern Steamship case against the Labor Board in 316 U.S., which is indeed a federal decision and it may show that we have here the problem of a federal maritime tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.207" offset="7432234">The state court did not reach that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.464" offset="7441220">It isn't before this Court but Mr. Justice White asked the question and I thought I should describe the holding in the state court that this is indeed illegal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1867.793" offset="7574549">The Solicitor General in the Empresa case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in the Empresa case, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of the United States of the -- Supreme Court of New York State in the Incres case have all held and all agreed that the flag law does not govern this situation by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.673" offset="7746017">Mr. Cox, of course, has some reservations but Judge Friendly in the Empresa case stated the Board is right in saying, “The scope of its powers in respect of seamen is not to be determined by the simple notion that a Honduran registered ship is a floating piece of Honduran territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.306" offset="7852596">That is a mere fiction -- a figure of speech whose fictitious character was exposed long ago”.</text>

            <text syncTime="1955.303" offset="7924590">Mr. Cox, in his brief to this Court at page 13 stated, “The flag in registry of a vessel are not always decisive”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.976" offset="7983313">At page 45 of this brief, he said, “This is not to say that Congress necessarily intended the Act never to be applicable to foreign-flag vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.038" offset="8039528">There maybe situations in which other considerations may outweigh the law of the flag and may call for the application of the Labor Act to foreign-flag vessels”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.050" offset="8095535">And again at page 45 of his brief, he said, “One would have to consider not only the weight of this country's interest but also the possible significance if any of the fact that the doctrine that the law of the flag to control was established long prior to the growth of true flag of convenience shipping”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.321" offset="8204622">The Attorney General in his brief to the Board in the West India case said, “It is elementary that the Board has the duty in the first instance of making the determination of whether seamen and ships involved are employees and employers within the Act”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.366" offset="8296887">And that the terms employee and employer in the Act draw substance from the policy and purposes of the Act, the circumstances and background of the particular employment relationships, and all the hard facts of industrial life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.911" offset="8370970">Citing National Labor Relations Board against E. C. Atkins, 331 United States, and he continued in his brief to say, “Through its past, the Board must not only bring an appreciation of economic realities but is free to take account of the more relevant economic and statutory considerations in determining whether or not, the Act is applicable”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.069" offset="8483610">The Appellate Division for the Supreme Court of the State of New York in this case said, “The Liberian nationality of plaintiff and the Liberian registry of the ships should not be conclusive of the character of the shipping involved”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.803" offset="8550588">The NLRB has inappropriate cases involving American ships flying foreign flags of convenience ships has so determined and the conclusions are entirely persuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.647" offset="8609938">So that when the -- this case came to the New York State Court of Appeals, there was no question was that the Board, as Mr. Justice Stewart noted, had already asserted jurisdiction of the foreign-flag cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.185" offset="8696142">Now, I respectfully submit that it has had been suggested, if not perhaps stated by Judge Friendly and suggested by the Solicitor General that Congress did intend the Board to have jurisdiction over certain types of foreign-flag operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.105" offset="8803767">And isn't -- it's not correct to say that in those circumstances, surely the Board has the right and has the primary jurisdiction to determine whether or not in a given situation, it should assert jurisdiction over a foreign-flag operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.167" offset="8896031">I hardly think that Congress when it wrote the Act carved out to all convenient classifications as it was suggested by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.598" offset="8957785">And I respectfully submit that on the strength of his own argument, on the strength of his own observation that the National Labor Relations Board does have primary jurisdiction in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.599" offset="9029778">Now, if the Court of Appeals was correct and if we are to apply the context test as we submit was promulgated by this Court in the Larson case and I think was necessarily followed by Judge Friendly in the Empresa case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.527" offset="9117445">Then I say, that it is certainly arguable that the National Labor Relations Board has jurisdiction from the first instance and that the New York State Court of Appeals was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.284" offset="9180557">Now, we must remember that the union had filed a charge against the Incres Company which was pending before the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.884" offset="9246908">And as we learned from Myers against Bethlehem Steel Company which to my knowledge has never been reversed or modified or distinguished, the Board must first be allowed to exhaust its administrative processes before resort can be had to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.653" offset="9345964">And I say that even if a charge had not been filed, then certainly under the arguable subject doctrine, first promulgated in Garmon and later I submit extended in Marine Engineers Beneficial Association against Interlake that this was a case of preemption pure and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.369" offset="9460799">I know that my adversary refers to the arguable subject doctrine as not being applicable here because they don't reach the threshold question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.187" offset="9512103">But surely the Board was required to grapple with the threshold question of commerce in Myers against Bethlehem, and was also required to grapple with the threshold question of what constitutes a labor organization in Interlake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.197" offset="9588172">And so we say that this Court need go no further than the preemption doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.588" offset="9621713">However, should this Court go or choose to go beyond preemption then I respectfully submit that on the facts of this case which were glossed over by the Solicitor General, that on the facts in this case, the kind of shipping that Incres is engaged in is truly the shipping of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.026" offset="9747519">Let us examine the operation of Incres.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.499" offset="9769357">Its two vessels are registered under the law of Liberia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.597" offset="9805720">It has, at least it claims to have a home office in England or in London.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.474" offset="9841246">What it does in that office, we don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.478" offset="9857233">Nothing was said about it in the summary hearing before the Supreme Court of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.950" offset="9895163">It is owned concededly by Italian National.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.570" offset="9913657">But what are its operations?</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.384" offset="9924942">These two vessels both come to New York City and operate not temporarily, not casually, not transiently, but regularly in the cruise business between New York City and the Caribbean.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.393" offset="10004982">And in so conducting its business is competing with our own American flag vessels engaged in the same trade, engaged in the same cruise business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.742" offset="10062346">And how does it operate?</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.083" offset="10071751">It operates admittedly through a wholly owned New York State subsidiary, the Incres agency, and both utilize the same offices at 39 Broadway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.648" offset="10137997">They both have the same letterhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.114" offset="10159835">Mr. Berman Jerry is not only the President of Incres Line, the foreign corporation and the member of its Board of Directors, but he is also the President and/or rather an officer, and a Member of the Board of Directors of the New York State Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.162" offset="10239979">And he, together with Mr. Wilson, conduct the day to day operations of these two luxury vessels.</text>

            <text syncTime="2938.748" offset="11858317">That's another vast distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.675" offset="11874095">Secondly, it is truly engaged in the commerce of Great Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.916" offset="11899068">Now, I don't think that we can say the same for the two Incres vessels which are clearly engaged in the commerce of the United States and are nothing more than floating hotels and I might say, financed with American capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.813" offset="11982660">There is a $4 million mortgage loan advanced by the American -- by the Bank of America covering these two vessels and the interesting thing is that the New York agency guarantees the payment of this loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.220" offset="12060296">So that when the loan was first made, it was signed by a Mr. Barnett as both officer of Incres, and is the foreign corporation, and also as an officer of the New York Incorporated agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.671" offset="12134066">When that loan was extended, it was signed by Mr. Berman Jerry as President of the foreign corporation and also as an officer and director of the New York State Corporation so that not only are these two vessels regularly engaged in the trade of the United States they are financed by American capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.362" offset="12260812">They've worked hand in hand together with a New York Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.507" offset="12289442">And as I said before, they received all of their consular communications in their New York office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.923" offset="12327058">So that we cannot merely say that there are no connections with American commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.938" offset="12367078">Now something -- and much has been said on the subject of the internal order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.971" offset="12419218">I submit that a distinction must be drawn and has been drawn between discipline on board ship and wages and powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.407" offset="12485047">And just as this has been recognized in the Treaty between the United States and Honduras, so is it recognized but even stronger in the Treaty between the United States and Liberia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.130" offset="12559862">And I refer to page 55 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.054" offset="12579610">It begins at page -- the bottom of page 54.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.978" offset="12603329">Treaty -- this is the -- this is Article X of the Consular Convention between the United States and Liberia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.071" offset="12639692">And it says, “A consular officer shall have exclusive jurisdiction over controversies arising out of the internal order of private vessels of this country and shall a law in exercised jurisdiction in cases wherever arising between officers and crews pertaining to the enforcement of discipline on board provided the vessels, person in charge of long doing shall have entered the port within its consular district”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.461" offset="12741256">And then the language continues at the bottom of page 55 of our brief and it says, “Such consular officer shall also have jurisdiction also over issues concerning the adjustment of wages and the execution of contracts relating thereto provided however, that such jurisdiction shall not exclude the jurisdiction”, and here's where the language is stronger than in the Honduran Treaty, “shall not exclude the jurisdiction conferred on local authorities under existing or future laws”.</text>

            <text syncTime="3226.155" offset="13008018">Not only for this but if we look at page 369 -- of Section 369 of the Liberian Labor Code which is referred to at page 2 of our supplemental statement we find this very interesting provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.954" offset="13087222">Notwithstanding anything in this chapter, nothing shall prevent a shipowner or an employer from entering into agreements with employees covering the provisions of this chapter as a consequence of collective bargaining or otherwise embodying standards not lower than those required by this chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.880" offset="13170918">Now I submit that Section 369, if read together with Article X of the Consular Convention, not only contemplates the making of collective bargaining agreements but also contemplates that the local law shall have the right to make those collective bargaining or collective bargaining agreements maybe made under the local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.063" offset="13271646">Now, since the vessels doesn't ever touch Liberian waters are we to expect that the seamen can get any sort of appropriate, realistic representation by let us say, a Liberian based union where they never go there?</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.585" offset="13373733">And similarly, since the vessel only goes to Italy once a year at which time the crew members take their vacations or leave the employee of that vessel, are they to receive the necessary and realistic protection that goes with representation by a labor organization from an Italian based union?</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.061" offset="13487626">Or isn't this more realistic to assume particularly if we are mindful of the language in the Atkins case on the basis of hard economic reality, that the best place and the only place where these seamen can get the proper and appropriate representation is from an American based union when these vessels come into port, as they do every week and when their grievances are processed as they do everyday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.614" offset="13637778">Now, Mr. Justice White asked a very pertinent question in my adversary report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.271" offset="13688456">This Act work both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.497" offset="13697337">Now, what about the application of the Labor Act against unions?</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.746" offset="13726386">And Mr. McAllister was quite right -- quite correct when he said that, “We have not sought to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act against this union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.134" offset="13783960">But the record factor that in the Navios case which is cited in our brief and which resulted from the picketing of the (Inaudible) in Philadelphia that not only were did -- were secondary boycott charges filed by secondary employers against this very union, International Maritime Workers Union, and not only where those charges processed but those charges were settled and there is presently pending in the courts of Pennsylvania, damage suits under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.011" offset="13987401">Mr. Justice Douglas in his dissent in the Benz case noted quite properly I submit, that there too that employers and foreign employers have utilized the Act against American unions, who are engaged in picketing of foreign-flag vessels.</text>
