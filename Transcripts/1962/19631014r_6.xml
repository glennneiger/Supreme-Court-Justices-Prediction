            <text syncTime="64.171" offset="362241">A picket line protesting the assumed position of the park of segregation was setup, and shortly thereafter, about 8:15 in the evening, the five petitioners, young Negroes, went into the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.126" offset="446042">There was no obstruction as there are no tickets or other entry required for gaining admission to the park.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.650" offset="796187">In an orderly fashion, there is no question about this, they sat quietly on the carousel.</text>

            <text syncTime="346.076" offset="1489895">The Court of Appeals of Maryland upheld the convictions on the ground that the discrimination by the state, if such there was, was one step removed, that the action here was one step removed from state enforcement of a policy of segregation.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.189" offset="1870342">But, second, we challenge under the rule of law in this country, under the Fourteenth Amendment, that a state can create or recognize a private right of discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2733.153" offset="11038172">We believe, Your Honors, that the cases in both the state and the lower federal courts uniformly, without exception, support the proposition to which I have just referred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.320" offset="11086865">And we would submit that this Court has recognized and perhaps implicitly, if not expressly, recognized the validity of the proposition in such cases as Terminal Taxicab, Boynton versus Virginia, and Wilmington Parking Authority, all, of course cited in the State's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.866" offset="11168994">And, to argue, as petitioners do hear this morning, that the Fourteenth Amendment requires the state affirmatively to prevent such discrimination, as was present in this case, is really to ignore approximately 100 years of consistent constitutional interpretation of the amendment as being solely prohibitive in character upon the states.</text>
