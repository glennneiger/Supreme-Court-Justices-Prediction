            <text syncTime="30.621" offset="225886">Mr. Greenberg.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="32.811" offset="234663">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.968" offset="243231">These are two school segregation cases, consolidated for argument before this Court arising in Knoxville and Davidson County, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.290" offset="284505">Davidson County is the suburban county surrounding the City of Nashville.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.194" offset="304149">Both of these cases were tried and decided separately in the District Court and in the Court of Appeals, but they both present common questions of law and fact and are consolidated here for argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.580" offset="361723">The Knoxville case was filed on December 1959 and involved at the outset a grade a year, 12-year desegregation plan approved by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.602" offset="405817">The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a 12-year plan was not fast enough and reversed on this aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.972" offset="439254">Their characterization of the Board's plan appears on page 161 of the record in their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.937" offset="487111">And I'd like to quote a sentence briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.901" offset="502993">The evidence does not indicate that the Board is confronted with the type of administrative problems contemplated by the Supreme Court in the Second Brown decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.379" offset="536848">And further down on that page, the position of the Board that it would continue to operate under these unenforceable laws until compelled by law to do otherwise does not commend itself to the court for the acceptance of a plan that provides for a minimum degree of desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.136" offset="599960">So I as stated, it disapproved the 12-year aspect of the plan but it -- and it also in a separate opinion later decided, disapproved the plan of the Board with regard to vocational school.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.859" offset="646771">And neither of those two aspects of the case are involved in this petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.468" offset="665266">However, the Court did uphold a racial transfer plan which was part of this desegregation plan and I will describe this plan in a moment because it is identical to the racial transfer plan that appears in the Davidson County case.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.025" offset="727437">The Davidson County case was filed in September 1960 and it too involved a grade a year plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.713" offset="750216">The District Court held that this was not fast enough under the standards set down by this Court in the Second Brown decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.694" offset="778115">And it required the respondents to desegregate four grades in January of 1961 and file by September of 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.543" offset="813537">In other words, to catch up with the City of Nashville with which it was contiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.166" offset="836002">The District Court refused to allow the named individual plaintiffs not covered by the grades of the plan to receive a nonsegregated education.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.658" offset="874036">Now, the racial transfer aspect and the right of the individual plaintiffs both were taken to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.211" offset="900263">The Court of Appeals upheld the racial transfer aspect and also upheld the refusal to allow the individual petitioners to obtain a desegregated education and grades other than those covered by the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="217.895" offset="974973">We brought the racial transfer aspect of both cases and the right of the individual plaintiffs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.978" offset="999320">And this Court granted certiorari only with regard to the common question of both cases and that is the racial transfer aspect of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.327" offset="1040697">Both cases involved racial transfer provisions which are almost entirely identical in language.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.251" offset="1072358">First -- and they both appear on page 4 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.942" offset="1095137">First, both school systems adopted a general transfer provision such as you might find in any school system in such as they had previously had.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.349" offset="1140799">That appears on page 4 of the brief in the footnote saying that transfers would be allowed when good cause therefore is shown in Knoxville and Davidson County also using the words when good cause therefore is shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.222" offset="1212270">In addition to that, both plans provided that under certain circumstances which depended upon race, the right to transfer would be automatic and those circumstances are as follows: a. When a white student would otherwise be required to attend a school previously serving colored students only, b. When a colored student would otherwise be required to attend a school previously serving white students only, c. When a student would otherwise be required to attend to school where the majority of students of that school or in his or her grade are of a different race.</text>

            <text syncTime="326.565" offset="1409651">That is elucidated by one of the respondent in the Knoxville case.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.350" offset="1436818">The question “Under, your plan, this provision of Paragraph 6 a, b and c will constitute automatic basis for transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.326" offset="1464717">All that a student has to show is that he meets these conditions and then he will be automatically entitled the transfer, administratively more or less?”</text>

            <text syncTime="368.410" offset="1577044">“That under this provision in Paragraph 5 of the plan setting for these racial conditions based on a minority race transfer, the effect of it is to permit a child to choose segregation outside of his zone but not to choose integration outside of his zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.293" offset="1628557">That is true, isn't it?”</text>
            <text syncTime="382.326" offset="1632632">Answer: “The child and his parents can choose, yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="385.630" offset="1645902">Further down on the page, Mr. Williams makes a statement, the accuracy of which is confirmed by the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.823" offset="1674637">“It's substantially identical to the city provision, if Your Honor please, but it was not brought to this Court's attention at the time that the city provision was approved, exactly how the city provision operates as Mr. Moss had described.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.480" offset="1721344">It has been operated so that instead of going to the school in his zone and there seeking a transfer, no white child in the city has ever seen one of the allegedly integrated schools to which he was assigned.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.286" offset="1764498">No Negro child who didn't affirmatively seek a transfer to an integrated school has ever seen the integrated school to which the National Board led this Court to believe he was assigned.”</text>
            <text syncTime="423.761" offset="1798457">So that presents a little different, a little more than was before the Court in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.581" offset="1813713">And then he asked the witness, “And that is true, what I have stated, isn't it, Mr. Moss?</text>
            <text syncTime="431.370" offset="1828864">That is the way the plan operates in the city and that's the way you intend to operate it?”</text>

            <text syncTime="599.665" offset="2501987">And a little earlier, that has to be read in conjunction with something earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.122" offset="2519855">Now, how many children -- on 256, the question is put as to how many children were illegible for transfer?</text>
            <text syncTime="610.912" offset="2547022">And the answer is that 693, that is 405 Negro children and 288 white children.</text>
