            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 59, A. J. Simler, Petitioner, against Leslie E. Conner.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_b_ogden" startTime="8.362" stopTime="110.945">
            <label>Mr. John B. Ogden</label>
            <text syncTime="8.362" offset="136861">If Your Honor please -- pardon me, John B. Odgen of Oklahoma City for the petitioner and in this case presents a constitutional question as to whether or not we are entitled to a jury trial, but even a more important question is whether or not when you go in the federal court, the state law and the state constitution applies in determining whether you’re entitled to a jury trial or whether you use the law of the state of the forum where the cause of action arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.294" offset="244590">In this case, the Circuit Court of the Tenth Circuit, twice in this same particular case, now I might say for the benefit of the Court, that this case has now been to the Circuit Court of Appeals three times and in the Supreme Court of United States once, but has never been tried, so it is rather unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.157" offset="311986">This is an action for declaratory judgment brought by Mr. Simler who was a former client of Mr. Conner.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.012" offset="335391">He was a plaintiff for United States Court in Okalahoma City.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.704" offset="346154">Mr. Conner of course was the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.381" offset="360887">The case was originally assigned to Judge Wallace, now deceased.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.042" offset="375515">He held we were entitled to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.474" offset="385233">I represent Mr. Simler and we had asked him a declaratory judgment action for the court to tell us whether we owed Mr. Conner anymore money for lawyer fees or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.743" offset="426297">We had paid him $24,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.559" offset="437582">We had paid attorney's -- paid me $7500 to assist Mr. Conner, had paid Mr. Grigsby, an associate of Mr. Conner's who had a 28% interest in Mr. Conner's fee, $12,800.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.238" offset="496306">Mr. Simler had paid to the opposing lawyers under the orders of the County Court of Oklahoma County, Oklahoma $46,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.849" offset="530787">So he had spent $90,300 for lawyer fees.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice William O. Douglas</label>
            <text syncTime="110.945" offset="547192">I suppose that might be of interest to the jury but --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_b_ogden" startTime="113.290" stopTime="215.766">
            <label>Mr. John B. Ogden</label>
            <text syncTime="113.290" offset="556492">No, the reason I said that, if the Court please, to show that the reason was necessary to find our whether we had paid out enough fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.424" offset="581047">I thought the Court would probably like to know how much we'd paid out to see that we did have a real reason to go into court because we didn't know whether we'd paid sufficient fees or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.065" offset="619604">So in the suit which was declaratory judgment action, after Judge Wallace transferred the case over during his lifetime to Judge Chandler.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.793" offset="658578">So upon the first hearing before Judge Chandler, Judge Chandler said, “Well, I will not give you a jury trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="144.780" offset="682506">Now, we had demanded a jury trial on a reply in our complaint, and on the response later for a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.323" offset="720645">So he said, “I won't give a jury trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="156.238" offset="728273">So then, in their brief, we went to Denver to the Court of Appeals to file an application for a writ of mandamus to require him to give to the petitioner, Mr. Simler, a jury trial. We have briefed it and argued it in Denver and then the Court of Appeals made an order and ordered Judge Chandler to give us a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.787" offset="802565">Then, when we came back there before Judge Chandler after he had received that order, he said, “Well, I won't have any kind of trial, I don't know he used the word, he said I'll just sustain a motion for summary judgment and there won't be any trial to it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="187.278" offset="852511">So, it will be like in difference; jury, non-jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.057" offset="863587">So that is what he did in the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.818" offset="870693">We made -- we were forced to make bond then and took the case back up the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.654" offset="890023">Then it went back and briefed that case and argued out there in Denver and then the Court of Appeals reversed Judge Chandler the second time if you call the first one a reversal, and they told Judge Chandler to give us a jury trial and they set aside his decree, sustaining the -- his judgment, sustaining the motion for summary judgment.</text>

            <label>Mr. John B. Ogden</label>
            <text syncTime="231.416" offset="1028995">Well, if the Court please, the opinions of the Circuit Court are printed -- let's see, the first opinion -- let's see, the Circuit Court reversed -- it was 282 F.2d and I have found -- or 282 F.2d at page 382, that was in 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.822" offset="1130663">Now then -- then after the court reversed him and set aside the summary judgment and ordered to give us a jury trial, Mr. Conner, the respondent here, filed a petition for certiorari in this Court which was by this Court denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.166" offset="1188028">Now then, after that was denied, and while it was pending on petition for a rehearing, there was an opinion came out of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma known as Southard versus MacDonald and it's cited at 360.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.147" offset="1235989">Well, I have the citation which I won't look at -- 360 P.2d 940.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.096" offset="1259708">In that case, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma held that a person was not entitled to a jury trial because it give him some bland to a lawyer, Mr. MacDonald overdue rent for a lawyer fee and then four years, seven months, and 10 days later, there was a petition suit filed, and in that petition suit there in Oklahoma, why -- these parties who had made the deed for the lawyer, four years and seven months before, asked the court to cancel the deed and said it was given for a lawyer fee and they'd made a contract for 40%, then when the case closed while carrying out their contract, they made a deed for the lawyer, 40% of that, four years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.084" offset="1427728">Now then, the Supreme Court simply said in that case, that that was not a jury case because it's a suit to cancel a deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.755" offset="1458343">Now, if the Court will pardon me for being personal, I think about 1923 or maybe 1925, I tried a case as a lawyer called Tillman versus [Inaudible] mentioned in this brief and in some of these opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.440" offset="1513096">And I didn't know, I thought it's entitled to cancel a deed to a lawyer, the name of Tillman on account of the facts, certain facts therein laid.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.492" offset="1553324">Now, we tried that by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.838" offset="1558758">I didn't know any better and the judge didn't and the lawyer didn't, so we just tried out for a jury, and I wanted -- they appealed to the Supreme Court, they complained about the instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.785" offset="1590523">The Supreme Court said, “Well, that don't make any difference, it's not a jury case anyway.”</text>
            <text syncTime="376.067" offset="1607659">Any suit to cancel a deed in Oklahoma is an equity matter, always has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.215" offset="1624273">That was announced 25 or 30 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.565" offset="1637648">So, I mean it's more than that actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.624" offset="1645902">There's never been any question.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.129" offset="1651858">Now, in this case, this Court when they have made this application here for rehearing and said it just -- the opinion just came down which changed the law in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.394" offset="1696998">They were referring to this opinion where the Supreme Court said he wasn't entitled to a jury to cancel a deed and that you've given somebody four or five years before any length of time, before that was an equity matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.028" offset="1743496">Well, this Court, I'm just guessing is this of course, but I'm just assuming that this Court just didn't look into it very carefully, and said, “Well, we have just remand this back out here to the Circuit Court and ask them to look at it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="421.806" offset="1790621">Now, that's the way I read the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.146" offset="1795950">I've got it right here, I mean, it wasn't an opinion, just an order from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.240" offset="1812355">So then, we all went back to Denver again --</text>

            <text syncTime="458.703" offset="1938160">Just a certain way in my mind here and I think I can make that very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.570" offset="1953625">Now -- so, when the Circuit Court of Appeals has got -- back out and that was the reason I appeared to this Court, directed the Circuit Court to look at the case again.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.130" offset="1987897">So, we went out then, we briefed the cases, the Circuit Court argued again.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.894" offset="1998973">So then the Circuit Court, for the third time, held that we were not entitled to a jury, that we were entitled to have out case tried without a jury and that case is found in 295 F.2d at page 534.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.480" offset="2065324">Now, then if the Court please, that gives you -- and then when the -- when the Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that we were not entitled in this case to a jury trial, then we filed, Mr. Simler filed a petition for certiorari in this Court and this Court granted and that's what we argue today.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.265" offset="2128436">So this is the second time the case has been in the Supreme Court of United States, and the third time it has been out in Denver, and as I say, it's not yet been tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.717" offset="2162291">Now, factually, I want to call to the Court's attention if I may the facts in this case and I'll support them for the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.419" offset="2197086">I'm just going to talk about the facts as of course contained in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.916" offset="2211088">Now then, if the Court please; on the 13th day, which is the 13th day of July 1952, Mrs. Fletcher died, that was Mr. Simler's sister and he was the only heir at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.920" offset="2259048">He lives in North Little Rock.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.832" offset="2266676">On the 18th day, she made a will in which she in effect disinherited him.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.651" offset="2286007">She only gave him a dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.880" offset="2294888">And so after she made this will, then on the -- she willed the bulk of her property to the Sisters of St. Francis which operates St. Anthony's Hospital which incidentally is the largest hospital in Oklahoma City and Yoke, I guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.488" offset="2361344">Well, the Sisters of St. Francis is a Catholic organization and it is a corporation, a foreign corporation organized under the laws of some other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.271" offset="2396453">Now, at that time, under the Constitution of the State of Oklahoma and the laws of the State of Oklahoma, a foreign corporation, in fact, no corporation could hold land outside of the city or town which was not necessary for it -- to hold in order to carryout the purposes of which it was organized.</text>

            <text syncTime="637.148" offset="2651930">And Mr. Sim -- Mr. Conner drew up a statement, it's in the record here, at page, as I remember 23 -- wait just a second, I'm sure it's 23 -- 23, 24 and 25, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.795" offset="2718595">Yes, on the record, if Your Honor please, at 23, 24, and 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.402" offset="2740955">Now, we'll take a little time to read this for the reason I think this very important in determining whether we are entitled to a jury trial in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.082" offset="2775751">I'm reading from page 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.115" offset="2783796">Now, this is a letter which Mr. Conner, the lawyer, drew up on July the 18th, 1952, at the time Mr. Simler employed him.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.136" offset="2819950">If you'll notice there, without me reading it in detail, this confirms our employment of yourself in law firm to represent us in a matter of Birdie Fletcher deceased now pending, and I'll skip along.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.452" offset="2865194">Now, we agreed to pay all of the witness fees, court costs, furnish all bonds, purchased copy of the record, from all and so forth, advanced to pay all the necessary bills and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.713" offset="2906258">We understand this will run about a $1000.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.660" offset="2922036">We also agree this is the important point, to pay you and your firm a reasonable attorney's fee for the services rendered and to be rendered, in this case, in the county court and if necessary, in the District Court, and if necessary in the Supreme Court of the State of Oklahoma, which fee maybe set by the county court or any other court if the matter is successful either by a trial or judgment or a compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.081" offset="3015659">If the matter is not won, a compromise is set and you're not to charge us fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.291" offset="3032586">Now, that is the first letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.790" offset="3038542">Now, my contention if Your Honor please is before this Court, that was full and complete contract, you could make one any fuller or any better.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.098" offset="3071770">They said I'll pay you a reasonable fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.118" offset="3083891">Now, as far as -- if the Court please, if he gets anything more than what's contained in that letter, he's getting something -- he's getting something he's not entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.241" offset="3112312">We want to pay him a reasonable fee.</text>

            <text syncTime="762.571" offset="3153690">So I was just saying that this letter here -- the reason I'm saying that, if the Your Honor please, is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.332" offset="3172707">That this first letter here, I say is complete and the rest of it, if you -- if it -- it would take away a jury trial, it would be a surplus, and there wouldn't be of any benefit anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.679" offset="3206040">So under this letter we're clearly entitled a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.464" offset="3217220">That's the reason I mentioned that because it says that he's entitled to a reasonable fee, that we're not -- couldn't agree on a reasonable fee, why then -- we'd left the court decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.208" offset="3252224">So that letter is full and complete, so there is no reason for Mr. Conner to make any other contract with Mr. Simpler because he has one that will protect him, just full and complete as it can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.170" offset="3292035">Now then if Your Honor please, on the 25th day of September 1952, we allege and this is before the Court in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="822.746" offset="3394330">In the reply, we set out that Mr. Conner called Mr. Simler to come down to his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.154" offset="3420035">Mr. Simler was there in Oklahoma City visiting his daughter or somebody and said he want to write him up a will or did write him up one, did [Inaudible] anybody with him, when he came down there.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.031" offset="3459532">Now, we allege in here that Mr. Simler was then 75 years old, I think that's about right, he's about 86 now.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.742" offset="3498297">Now, if the Court please, he went down there without anybody else for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.020" offset="3515434">He's going to write up a will.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.961" offset="3519195">When he got down there, Mr. Conner, tried to get him to sign this letter of September the 25th which appears on page 24 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.402" offset="3552946">Now, we allege that Mr. Simler wouldn't sign it.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.613" offset="3565798">They argued and quarreled and fussed and finally Mr. Conner took Mr. Simler to lunch and bought him some beer and some food and went back to the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.759" offset="3598399">And again, they quarreled and fussed and he had us come in and finally he told him if you don't sign, he's going to ruin you in different things of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.456" offset="3625148">So Mr. Simler thereby himself, at that age, had an Eighth Grade education, didn't know anything about law or lawyer fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.793" offset="3654510">And Mr. Conner prepared this letter and then up here where it says September the 25th, you see the word 25th, and that was blank.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.283" offset="3684498">That shows up in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.424" offset="3689096">We've got a full -- completely blank, and Mr. Conner wrote in there, somebody did with a pen, the 25, which indicates to me and we thought indicated that -- that that needn't be a jury matter if they had it drawn up before he ever got down there, they had to, because it had September and then blank of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.516" offset="3749386">Now, Mr. Simler, under those conditions, signed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.249" offset="3760358">Now he alleged that he was imposed on by his lawyer, that his lawyer practiced actual fraud on him and constructive fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="1664.480" offset="6761305">I believe it would too, of that reason, we just get -- I haven't read that syllabus out of the Court because our Constitution makes that law of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.765" offset="6798399">Now -- “At the outset, we may dispose of one of the grounds upon which the trial court acted in striking the demand for the trial by jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.752" offset="6838418">I'm reading on page 896 and paragraph 1, “That based upon the view that the right to trial by jury may be lost as to legal issues where those issues are characterized as 'incidental' to equitable issues, for our previous decision make it plain that no such rule may be applied in the federal courts”, citing Scott versus Neely, decided in 1891.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.855" offset="6930787">“This Court held that a court of equity could not even take jurisdiction of a suit in which a claim properly cognizable only at law is united in the same pleadings with a claim for equitable relief.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.705" offset="6978226">Now, then the court said that -- I'll just read it on down here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.615" offset="6997870">Now, just one second, I want to find that part, if the Court please, at the -- that for just a second, where the court said, “We were not only entitled”, this Court said -- they were not only entitled to have the jury determine whether it was a breach of the contract, but they were entitled to have the jury determined just what the contract was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.810" offset="7098598">Now, that's what we're saying here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.601" offset="7105808">Now then, if the Court please, if you take the second letter of the 25th day of September out of this case, you just have one that entitles us a reasonable lawyer fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.551" offset="7141543">Now then, the very fact -- the evidence before this Court today without a witness being sworn the very fact that they're here contesting a jury trial and saying they want the letter of the 25th day of September 1952 to stand as a criteria in this case, that very fact shows if the Your Honor please, that they think, the opponent -- the respondent thinks that that second letter was to his benefit or he wouldn't be paid his due because the first letter gives him a reasonable lawyer fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.628" offset="7257840">So why would he need the second letter if all he wants is a reasonable lawyer fee?</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.909" offset="7271006">There's no reason for whatever except that it gives him a terrific advantage over this old man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.994" offset="7295352">Now, in this case, the -- the respondent -- now in this case, this is for a breach of a contract and an infringement on one of these rights, in order to operate this Dairy Queens and it was for the county, it was for an injunction, trademark infringement, and breach of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.139" offset="7367973">And the court said -- here's the necessary prerequisite -- I'm reading on page 990.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.745" offset="7406320">“The necessary prerequisite to the right to maintain a suit for an equitable accounting, like all other equitable remedies, is, as we pointed out in Beacon Theatres, the absence of an adequate remedy at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.281" offset="7448534">Consequently, in order to maintain such a suit on a cause of action cognizable at law, as this one is, the plaintiff must be able to show that the action between the parties are such a complicated nature that only a court of equity can satisfactorily unravel them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.014" offset="7507466">In view of the powers given to federal court, I'll just skip on down here to what -- “A jury, under proper instructions from the court could readily determine the recovery if any, to be had here, whether the theory finally settled upon is that of a breach of contract, that of a trademark infringement, or any combination of the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.775" offset="7586461">The legal remedy cannot be characterized as inadequate merely because the measure of damages may necessitate a look into petitioner's business records.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.858" offset="7630764">Now then, if the Court please, in this opinion, I don't have that part marked, I thought of it though, but I don't see it right quick and I don't take up too much time just looking around there and try to find the portion of that opinion, but that opinion says this, I know, it's says that the court -- the first litigant is entitled to have the jury pass upon, not only whether there was a breach of the contract but just what the contract was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.691" offset="7742151">Now, in this case here, if the Court please, the -- we're entitled to have jury we think to decide whether or not this contract which Mister -- it's not really a contract, I don't think you can call that anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.437" offset="7797112">The reason that I don't think it has any legal name is because Mr. Connor never did sign it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.148" offset="7819995">But when he took the employment on the 13th -- on the 8th -- yes, the 18th day of July 1952 and became Mr. Simler's lawyer, Mr. Simler had the right to rely upon him in every detail, and to have great confidence in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.177" offset="7888123">Now, that he couldn't make any other contract except for a reasonable fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.569" offset="7905677">And then there's another thing I want to call the Court's attention, a racehorse can just run so fast and they can't run any faster, and a lawyer can try a case just so hard and he can't try it any harder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.541" offset="7945488">But when he makes a contract, did he represent somebody, he makes one impliedly that he will do the very best that he can for his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.571" offset="7977671">So what consideration could Mr. Connor give to Mr. Simler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.603" offset="7993762">And Mr. Simler said, “Well, you're already my lawyer, you're doing the best as you, aren't you?</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.746" offset="8006405">He said, “Yes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.502" offset="8009331">Well, what's the use of -- what consideration can you give me for making another contract, there couldn't be any, because he don't have anything except the services and he's already obligated to give him to the best of his ability and to his best to his extent.</text>

            <text syncTime="2094.301" offset="8480580">Well, I thought, if the Court please, if you will pardon me saying this, I thought that's all to be to it and think it take over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.638" offset="8505971">I -- they just put a jury out then that Mr. Conner testified what all he did and other lawyers testified what they thought was reasonable and then that's what I want in the testimony we wished to and what our kind of thought is reasonable, but a jury go out, judge say, “You've heard his testimony, go out and decide what's a reasonable fee.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.912" offset="8566993">Now, that's what I thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.450" offset="8573158">Now, if the Court please, would you pardon me to just finish, I want to make a statement to you now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.214" offset="8592280">Oh, I mean, me and not you, I just wanted to tell you that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.152" offset="8612028">You see, this letter was without consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.924" offset="8623104">Now, an agreement to do that which a person is already bound to do is no consideration at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.785" offset="8650480">Now, Mr. Conner was bound under the letter of the 18th of July to represent Mr. Simler, everybody admits that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.149" offset="8679946">Now, then therefore, he was already bound to an agreement to do something which are already legally obligated to do is no consideration and I have two cases on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.566" offset="8713592">One of them, if you will pardon me for being personal again, was one, I was a trial judge, a district judge down Ardmore, Oklahoma, I ruled that away and the Supreme Court affirmed it, I have cited it in my brief there not because I rule them, just because it happened to fit in the case for somebody who tried to enforce a contract that they had made to do something which they were already obligated to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2171.088" offset="8787675">Already -- now, Mr. Connor is already obligated to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.148" offset="8800005">Now, he has no consideration for this second letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.902" offset="8810977">So he said, “What does the second letter have?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.452" offset="8817142">It doesn't have anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.490" offset="8821321">Actually, of course the jury is entitled to determine and that's what judge Wallace ruled, what the Circuit Court ruled twice to this -- until Southard versus MacDonald came up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.955" offset="8863222">But anyway, if the Court please, in that case, the jury is entitled to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.585" offset="8889762">I feel positive under the holdings of this Court and all of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.460" offset="8913168">I have cited cases on matters in the nature of lawyers' contracts, but there -- a lot of them insurance cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.176" offset="8952038">But out here in California, the legislature finds the law that said that if a lawyer, you know, quit the case, had been trying along this with -- while then, the judge could fix the lawyer fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.276" offset="9000521">Well, the Court of Appeals of California said that's unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.283" offset="9012537">It said the lawyer is not entitled to anymore preference than anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.368" offset="9028838">If he has any fees coming, he has a suit just like anybody else, and they held that unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.242" offset="9048377">If the Court please, I'd like a few minutes to close, I don't know how much I've used up, but I will -- if it's alright with the Court, I just want them for rebuttal.</text>

            <label>Mr. Peyton Ford</label>
            <text syncTime="2250.117" offset="9103862">I've got about five minutes, do you want me to proceed on those?</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.358" offset="9140851">At the outset, I'm not going to tell the Court what fee Mr. Connor is paying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.060" offset="9159659">I'm going to get this -- maybe I can briefly get this back in perspective, at least I'll try to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.763" offset="9202395">In September 1952, Mr. Simler retained Mr. Connor to contest a certain will filed by Mr. Simler's sister which left him $1 under the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.017" offset="9267388">In September, a supplemental agreement was made and that was entered into setting forth what a reasonable fee was to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.727" offset="9318275">The first letter said they would be paid a reasonable fee to be decided by the county court or any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.273" offset="9348472">That contract didn't contemplate a jury in passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.619" offset="9365817">But in September, after Mr. Conner had consulted other lawyers and determined not only to start an action in the County Court of Oklahoma County, but also in the United State's District Court in challenging the right of a corporation to take land outside of the corporate city limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.742" offset="9454320">Those matters had been discussed at great length. He told Mr. Simler and this is in the record of the complication of the litigation, his necessity to hire other lawyers to assist the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.972" offset="9515238">At that time, they agreed upon a scale of the fees starting I think at 25 to 33 and a 50% if it went to the higher courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.455" offset="9561213">It also provided, there's no recovery, there is no fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.749" offset="9590366">Following the September letter, litigation was began in the county court on October 2nd and in the Federal District Court on October the 14th.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.889" offset="9634879">This litigation continued through both federal and state courts through 19 separate trials and appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.632" offset="9669883">And it wasn't until May 1957 that it was finally included, that's without reference to any litigation concerning the attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.936" offset="9715127">The Federal Court ruled first in 1953, in petitioner's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.963" offset="9743235">On November 1954, the Oklahoma County Court entered a decree awarding the farm to petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.051" offset="9771551">Thereafter, the respondent where the country court have awarded certain expenses and legacies paid out of the proceeds from the farm that petitioner got, the respondent took that case to the Supreme Court of Oklahoma and recovered some $73,000 for the petitioner, in other words, he does not have to be paid out of the proceeds of the farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.851" offset="9878758">The petitioner finally took the farm beginning sometime in 1954 though this other litigation continued after.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.427" offset="9925047">And it wasn't until after he'd had the farm in his firm possession that there was any question ever came up about this attorney fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.940" offset="9959111">It was then by some legal [Inaudible] domain, this farm just came to and there was no work done, there was no litigation, there were 19 separate proceeding, it did go to the Court of Appeals three times, the Supreme Court, twice, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma Court twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.940" offset="10027133">Somehow, this request just came.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.401" offset="10048972">And following some long period of disagreement in which Mr. Grigsby was paid off, in which another lawyers' interest satisfied in which the proceeds to more runs -- county farm amounting some 60 odd thousand dollars was used to pay Mr. Grigsby's fee of $12,000 which left him a lien on the farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.808" offset="10162552">And from those proceeds, minus the $12,000, Mr. Simler took $25,000, Mr. Conner took $25,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.757" offset="10206438">In the Court's order granting summary judgment, it was a specific order requiring on equitable accounting for any moneys that may or may not have been paid, that wouldn't be if necessary, would on derogation of the 50% awarded to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.307" offset="10292642">Now, these names are clearly admitted by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.795" offset="10318555">And I'm speaking toward the motion for the summary judgment and the grant of the summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.401" offset="10348962">The terms of the September instrument, they're not in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.557" offset="10369651">The petitioner's execution thereof, that is in question, poor performance by the petitioner's obligations under that contract, in fact the litigation went not only to highest court of Oklahoma, but the highest court of the land.</text>
