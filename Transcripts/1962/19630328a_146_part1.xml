            <text syncTime="21.759" offset="190360">Floyd B. Engeman, the Assistant Attorney General for the State of Colorado will share the argument with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.833" offset="222751">I am going to open and I hope that I would be able to reserve time for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.825" offset="254621">May I first review with the Court, the facts relating to Marlon D. Green and Continental Air Lines?</text>
            <text syncTime="48.282" offset="296521">Marlon D. Green was a United States Air Force officer serving in the orient.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.566" offset="325674">He had worked in air-sea rescue and he had over 3,000 flight hours in the Armed Forces.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.375" offset="364857">Like many, a United States airline pilot, before his discharge, he had the ambition to become an airline pilot.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.016" offset="411460">Accordingly, before his discharge, he sent applications to large and to small airlines in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.250" offset="452420">In April of 1957, from the sales office of Continental Air Lines in San Francisco, he obtained an application form which was filed with the headquarters office of Continental Air Lines on April 30th, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.910" offset="530996">The application of Mr. Green appears in the record at page 211.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.376" offset="584913">Mr. Green's application, as originally filed, required a statement of descent and race as well as a photograph.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.323" offset="640711">Neither his descent nor his race nor the photographs were supplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.194" offset="664116">Later, the race was supplied at the direction of the checking out Officer, Captain Kramm when he was finally called to Denver.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.181" offset="752097">In fact, it was -- Continental Air Lines had no knowledge that Mr. Green was a Negro until after he had been ordered into Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.137" offset="791907">In June of 1957, Continental Air Lines was seeking to hire 14 or 15 pilots and they ordered into Denver, Marlon D. Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.210" offset="856168">He was met and given a link trainer test and found qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.493" offset="909354">The applicants who were also found qualified were five in number, the other applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.323" offset="960658">On page 7 of the white brief of Marlon D. Green, we have given a summary of the qualifications of the six applicants who were found qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.223" offset="1040280">The application blank for Continental Air Lines specifically required that anyone to be considered would have to have minimum flight time of 2,000 hours and be not over 30 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.952" offset="1103182">Mr. Green had more than 3,000 flight hours and was 27 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.538" offset="1133484">At that time, he was fully licensed as an airline pilot by the Civil Aeronautics Authority and Continental does not dispute that he was so licensed, nor does Continental dispute that he was qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.678" offset="1226062">In connection with the interview at Denver, the personnel office of Continental Air Lines was the place where other -- where employees would normally be sent, Mr. Green was not sent to that office, but he was interviewed at the air base at Stapleton Field.</text>

            <label>Mr. T. Raber Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="317.342" offset="1372766">It was in June of 1957 when he was being interviewed in Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.848" offset="1390738">There was a July 1957 class, the other men were found qualified and ordered to that class.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.462" offset="1433266">Mr. Green was not ordered to that class because he was under the impression that he would be pulled one way or the other, and not have receiving word, he called Continental Air Lines and was told that he was still being considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.547" offset="1505573">However, he was not accepted for the July class, and in August 1957, he filed a complaint with the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.144" offset="1567953">I think here it is important to point to the record as to the reason why or one of the reasons why Continental says that Mr. Green was not employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.226" offset="1624273">In the record at page 183 is a newspaper article from the state journal of Lansing, Michigan dated August 4th, 1957 entitled, “Job as Airline Pilot Eludes Lansing Negro, Blames Racial Bias”.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.903" offset="1707029">I think it's important to also point out that in the record at page 120 in folio on 359, an official of Continental said that the reason that Mr. Green was not selected for the July class was happenstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.138" offset="1783933">And at page 123, in answer to questions from the Commissioner, it has said, “We didn't need that number of pilots.”</text>
            <text syncTime="430.318" offset="1824684">And at folio 183, they discussed the article in the newspaper telling that Mr. Green's qualifications and difficulties trying to get the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.530" offset="1881527">At Record 134, there is a stipulation that the article appearing in the Lansing, Michigan Journal is substantially identical to a news release which was seen by a Continental official in an Albuquerque newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.578" offset="1957700">This case came on for hearing before the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.587" offset="1981733">Before the Commission hearing, counsel for Continental argued that the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Commission did not have jurisdiction because Continental was under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act and was also a certified air carrier by the Civil Aeronautics Board authorized to transport persons, property and United States mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.227" offset="2120286">Now, that argument was made in advance to the hearing and it appears an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.159" offset="2140035">However, I think we are here today confined to the facts which were put into the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.988" offset="2187368">Continental's evidence established that its headquarters offices, its personnel office, treasurer's office were all located at Denver, Colorado, that in Denver, Colorado it had 800 employees and that it was certified by the CAB.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.353" offset="2264795">But for an airline to carry any United States mail to fly in the airs over the State of Colorado even if the flights were only from Denver to Pueblo or to Denver to Colorado Springs, they would have to have certification by the CAB.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.011" offset="2339401">Continental did introduce into the record evidence that they were engaged in business in eight states and the “in eight states” is significant because they did not introduce any evidence that they were engaged in interstate commerce or in commerce between the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.953" offset="2423202">The record clearly shows that they had bases at Dallas and El Paso, Texas, that is at page 109.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.647" offset="2469909">But Texas is a large enough state to adequately take care of intrastate transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.327" offset="2500629">They also show in the record at page 107 that there was a sales office at San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.134" offset="2535946">Now, whether or not there was any activity of an intrastate agent in any of the other states or in any of the states, no evidence was offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.989" offset="2579310">They did state that they did business in New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Illinois but whether that was just fly over or whether it was sales or what they did, we do not know from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.212" offset="2628211">But it's more important, especially in view of the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court that the respondent, Continental, did not introduce any evidence of any law of any other state, any of the other seven states.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.899" offset="2714937">The only law which was before the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Commission, the only law which was before the Denver District Court, and the only law which has been before the Colorado Supreme Court, has been the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act and the federal laws which had been introduced in the record by reason of the pleadings and the statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.659" offset="2817964">It is important, I think, also to bear in mind that the record shows at page 125 and 129 that under the collective bargaining contract with the American Pilots Association, Continental had the right to hire whomever it pleased on a one year probationary basis and during that one year probationary basis, they had the right to discharge without any question.</text>

            <text syncTime="867.410" offset="3573008">The -- there was also not introduced in the record before the Anti-Discrimination Commission and that's the only place for it to be introduced on any burd -- any evidence of any burden, or expense, or inefficiency, or delay, or change of pilots in flight, or confusion in interstate operations, or restriction of its right of free passage.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.872" offset="3718875">Now, I think there is an important point which was introduced by the United States into the record before the Colorado Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.535" offset="3757537">In the stipulation which was entered into before the Denver District Court, it was agreed that Continental was certified by the CAB to carry mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.347" offset="3828799">One issue is whether or not they did carry mail and we do not dispute that they did carry mail, but insofar, as there was any contract with the United States to carry mail, there was no evidence of any such contract introduced in the record before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.420" offset="3905076">And before the Colorado Supreme Court, the Attorney General of United States, by affidavit, brought to the attention of the Colorado Supreme Court, the fact that there was no mail contract between Continental Air Lines and the United States, but they were -- there is no dispute that they didn't carry mail.</text>

            <label>Mr. T. Raber Taylor</label>
            <text syncTime="977.421" offset="4013014">I think it is not, Your Honor, but despite in all of these cases, it's hard to decide which is going to be the controlling one.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.652" offset="4073932">One point after the carrying before the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Commission, the petitioner there responded here at Continental, appealed to the Denver District Court challenging the jurisdiction of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.667" offset="4166092">And at that juncture, Mr. Green introduced in the record, in his answer, a specific reference to the Enabling Act of the State of Colorado passed by the Congress of United States in 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.134" offset="4247907">This Act, which was the first Enabling Act of any state passed after the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, specifically provided that the Enabling Act of the State of Colorado by its Constitution and the State would make no distinction in civil or political rights on account of race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.330" offset="4348740">The Denver District Court after a hearing -- well, there were two hearings but -- and we went once to Colorado Supreme Court and back so I think we can elide that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.424" offset="4405060">But in the second hearing before Justice Black of the Denver District Court, he accepted the argument of Continental Air Lines and dismissed the complaint of Marlon D. Green on the ground of preemption and burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.234" offset="4500355">On appeal to the Colorado Supreme Court, we obtained a four to three decision in which the Colorado Supreme Court has announced a novel principle that racial discrimination by interstate carrier is a subject which must be free from diverse regulation by the several states and governed uniformly, if that all, by the Congress of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.740" offset="4654373">I think it is important to first view what federal laws are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.831" offset="4698676">First, I think we must point out that there has been no federal Fair Employment Practice Act passed involving either employers or employees engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.259" offset="4764400">Since 1944, Congress has perennially considered Fair Employment Practice Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.509" offset="4813406">I do not have in the brief, but since coming to Washington with better facilities, I have obtained the most recent statement from the congressional committee on House Committee on Education and Labor, Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1962, HR or Court Number 1370 on the current and the last bill considered and I think this provision from that report is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.926" offset="4919045">In recommending a federal Equal Employment Opportunity Act, the report says, “The committee wishes to make quite clear its intention to respect the rights of states and municipalities which carry on effective anti-discrimination programs to eliminate and prohibit discrimination in employment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.277" offset="5012459">This question of cooperation, I think, has to be reached with the question which Mr. Justice Goldberg addressed to me about the number of laws in the various states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.429" offset="5073063">There are 20 plus laws in the United States and in those states, there are roughly 63% of the population of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.493" offset="5129383">I think we can appropriately take judicial notice that the majority of the employees in the 63% of our population are engaged in interstate commerce and yet to this day, we have not had a federal Fair Employment Practice Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.596" offset="5225723">Now, the question as to when a Negro or when any minority person should be allowed the opportunity of work certainly goes back to the emancipation proclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.205" offset="5292178">And also to the -- to the laws which were enacted in fulfillment of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth and to an extent maybe the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.940" offset="5343169">The Congress of the United States when it was first considering the admission of Colorado to the union was confronted with the problem of Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment which provides that Congress shall have power to enforce by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.138" offset="5455914">I submit that the legislative history recited on pages 17, 18, 19 and 20 of the brief for Marlon D. Green indicates that it was the intention of the members of the Senate of the United States to pass appropriate legislation when they passed the Enabling Act for the State of Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.188" offset="5568136">In fact, it was the criticism of the dissenting voices that the bill as being introduced or being acted on by Congress would have the affect of enforcing into the Colorado Constitution and its organic law, a Civil Rights Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.343" offset="5672730">Now, it is my premise that even though the Congress of the United States said that there should be no distinction in civil or political rights and the Colorado Constitution implemented that concept in many details that there is still a residual of legislative authority in the State of Colorado and in its legislative body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.935" offset="5791117">Now, what is this residual of legislative authority which is now in the State of Colorado?</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.275" offset="5816508">Certainly, it is to fulfill the prohibition of the Fourteenth Amendment with regard to employees who are employed by the State of Colorado which the Fourteenth --</text>

            <text syncTime="1669.876" offset="6782830">Now I -- they did affirm the action of the Denver District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.393" offset="6816893">They did say that they might adopt the rationale of the Denver District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.175" offset="6844061">Therefore, it leads us, I think, to the necessity of facing the issue squarely and with that, I face it with the case of Corsi, Railway Mail Association against Corsi which I submit is the controlling decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.650" offset="6901948">The -- neither Mr. Westfeldt nor I had access to the briefs which are in this Court in the Corsi case and they state that the issues relating to interstate commerce were neither raised, nor discussed, nor decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.673" offset="6966105">I submit that the briefs and the record in the Corsi case abundantly show that the issues in that case parallel the issues in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.490" offset="7009364">Before the New York Court of Appeals, it was very clear that they were claiming the preemption argument therewith under Article 1, Section 8 with regard to postal service employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.279" offset="7068505">The employees in the Corsi case were U.S. Civil Service employees hired by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.726" offset="7122317">All of their qualifications passed on and approved by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.134" offset="7139871">And these employees were engaged in the business of writing the postal cards and engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.757" offset="7178428">To the argument that the issue was not involved in that case, I have before me the appellant's brief which was the Association's brief where they raised, the issue of commerce was discussed at page 38.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.083" offset="7243734">They also discussed the issue in the appellant's reply brief under 0.2 on the Interstate Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.702" offset="7282186">The brief for the Corsi appellee at pages 12 and 15 points out the fact that interstate commerce, not only the postal power but also the commerce power was being involved and was being invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.790" offset="7366510">Also, I think this is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.184" offset="7376123">Here, Continental's position is that their employees, these flight crew personnel, are a unique group of professional people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.359" offset="7424815">The uniqueness is that they fly aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.826" offset="7450728">The employees in the Corsi case which I submit is controlling were under the provisions of the Lloyd-La Follette Bill with regard to all types of working conditions, hours of employment but they did not have the right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.554" offset="7545605">But we had an area of which under the Lloyd-La Follette Bill of 1912 closely parallels the statutes which Continental claims to be preempted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1903.461" offset="7717177">Actually, Mr. Taylor's case is listed as the second case, but Mr. Taylor had the privilege of being connected with this case throughout its trial before the Commission in the District Court and both the times it was in our local Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.997" offset="7779349">I was pleased to come into the case after it had been decided by our local Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.077" offset="7811636">I thought for this reason that Mr. Taylor was much more familiar with the details of the facts on how this case actually got to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.130" offset="7851865">I think that our local Supreme Court, either purposely or by inadvertence, jumped to a conclusion that was not warranted when they made the statement that Mr. Taylor has called to the Courts attention which is found in our Supreme Court decision and is recited in the record of page 294 that racial discrimination by interstate carrier is a subject which must be free from diverse regulation by the several states and govern uniformly, if at all, by the Congress of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.857" offset="8002748">And then they say the opinions of the United States Supreme Court have established the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.688" offset="8026154">And they quote the famous case of Hall versus Decuir which was decided in 1877 and perhaps if we were in 1877, it might be that our Colorado statute would to some extent fall within that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.708" offset="8110164">However, we're not in 1877, we're in 1963 and many things have changed since that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.933" offset="8159065">The Court further relied upon the fact that Hall versus Decuir had been cited in the case of Morgan versus Virginia in 1946 and later in Portland Cement Company versus the City of Detroit that was decided in 1960 which I recall, Mr. Justice Stewart wrote the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.498" offset="8269406">This case of Hall versus Decuir involved a statute which was passed in -- shortly after the Civil War wherein a person in Louisiana had the right to share space with a person of another race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.009" offset="8355401">And this Court decided at that time that this indeed would cause a burden upon interstate commerce because at that time, Mississippi could have legislation that did in fact discriminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.331" offset="8428648">So if you had a colored and a white person riding in the same passage, same cabin, when it came to Mississippi, they would have to change their cabin space or this was a possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.033" offset="8483506">However, when you get to the case of Morgan versus Virginia decided in 1946, you have the other side of the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.231" offset="8528332">Virginia at that time had a statute which provided that a bus traveling through Virginia had to separate the Negro and the white passengers, a completely opposite situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.855" offset="8590817">And it's true that in that situation, this Court did strike down that segregation statute in Virginia which applied to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.440" offset="8641181">We think one of the things that our Supreme Court failed to recognize is that this was a discrimination statute which operated against the National Policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.651" offset="8698023">In other words, this was before a period of time with our line of cases beginning with Shelley versus Kraemer, Brown versus the Board of Education, Barrows versus Jackson, all of which this Court is very familiar with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.097" offset="8759777">I think the important point in Hall versus Decuir which our Supreme Court seemed to refuse to recognize is a statement in that decision when, which this Court said after delineating certain rules concerning interstate commerce, the burden upon it and the sort of thing said that it is far better to leave a matter of such delicacy to be settled in each case upon the view of the particular rights involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.963" offset="8895195">In other words, Hall versus Decuir doesn't per se say that discrimination or anti-discrimination is a no man's land that can't be touched by state legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.969" offset="8951202">It's only if the statute involved creates a burden and it has to be something more than just a slight inconvenience, there has to be a direct burden then the court, this Court, will look at that situation and at that time decide whether or not that statute should be stricken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.552" offset="9049631">I think another thing to keep in mind is that in 1877, it was permissible for a state to discriminate if this was the philosophy of the people of that state against a person of the colored race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.171" offset="9124028">In fact in 1883, the civil rights cases on page 25, we find comment along a line that certain privileges enjoyed by persons of the white race are not obtainable by persons of the colored race, paraphrasing that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.480" offset="9201246">However, time as changes as this Court is well aware, our philosophy changes and for this reason, I'm sure the Court has entered the decision to which I have referred previously, Shelley versus Kraemer and et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.068" offset="9287659">I refer to those on page 12 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.079" offset="9303646">I think that our Supreme Court completely missed the point when they relied upon Morgan versus Virginia as supporting the Hall versus Decuir case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.088" offset="9351711">Now, I'm not saying that Morgan versus Virginia didn't agree with the principle involved in Hall versus Decuir, but that principle is not that discrimination is a no man's land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.735" offset="9398314">It merely says that, if there is a burden then we will look at it and perhaps strike the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.858" offset="9430810">And I agree that in Morgan versus Virginia, in view of this statute requiring the separation of the passengers, you do have a burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.329" offset="9480652">Another case they refer to is Boynton versus Virginia, again a case of a terminal facility, a Virginia statute requiring separation of people in their eating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.853" offset="9530807">Again, this Court struck that statute as being a burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.611" offset="9561840">I think that if one concludes that it is still lawful to discriminate against Negroes in this United States, you have to completely disregard the precedent setting cases which have clearly established that this is not possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.405" offset="9652955">And I think this comes to the point that, as Mr. Taylor pointed out, there is absolutely no evidence in this record, and I think that's what this Court must consider, of any burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.009" offset="9723382">I ask myself in the brief and I ask the Court the question on page 14 but notwithstanding the fact that there is nothing in the record which would indicate a burden on interstate commerce Is it possible if there would be a burden on interstate commerce?</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.333" offset="9792658">I have struggled to find any sort of a situation that would in fact create this burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.064" offset="9843649">There was a bit of illusion in the record at page -- record 84 that because a Negro might fly an airplane that there would be disharmony in the cockpit and also at record 92 and 115, but actually these statements were never substantiated by any competent evidence.</text>

            <label>Mr. Floyd B. Engeman</label>
            <text syncTime="2477.477" offset="10013236">In fact I -- I question if there wouldn't be less of a problem in having a Negro and a white pilot controlling this plane than there would be if you had a Negro passenger perhaps in Texas or someplace boarding the plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.701" offset="10118144">Mr. Taylor has referred to the Enabling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.688" offset="10126085">I think that this to some extent is a delegation from Congress to Colorado to enact legislation that would prohibit discrimination against people because of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.421" offset="10189093">Now, I think that the case is perhaps -- answers this question of whether there's a conflict with federal policy or with federal statute is the Huron Portland Cement Company case which I refer to on page 16 of my brief wherein you have the situation of a steamship that was licensed under federal statute and that license there authorized and went to the inspection of the boilers as to whether the boilers were safe or whether they were not safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.609" offset="10349798">The City of Detroit had a -- an ordinance requiring certain precautions in view of the smoke that they emitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.086" offset="10383757">And this Court there held that notwithstanding the fact that this boat was federally licensed instilled in the City of Detroit to make it change -- make it change its boilers so that it didn't emit the smoke.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.594" offset="10449795">Now, this certainly raises two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.945" offset="10471111">First of all, it seems to me there would very -- there would possibly be a direct burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.619" offset="10501831">And secondly, that you do have both state and federal legislation acting on almost the same thing, in other words, the boiler system of the steamship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.951" offset="10563166">I think that one reason the Huron Portland Cement Company case is important is the fact that on page 480 -- 448 of 362, United States border, the Court said there that the record contains nothing to suggest the existence of any such competing or conflicting local regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.279" offset="10648534">The point was raised that it might be possible that there would be more than one regulation and the steamship might have a boiler that would be alright say for the city of Detroit but if it went someplace else, it wouldn't be proper there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.771" offset="10698480">That's exactly the point that's been raised in our case and I think that in this Huron case, it was much more possible that you could have these conflicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.561" offset="10741635">I don't believe that we have any such conflict in our -- in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.643" offset="10765981">As it's not shown in the record and I seriously question whether any can be shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.590" offset="10789700">Now, Mr. Taylor, I think, has covered quite adequately the Railway Mail Association versus Corsi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.520" offset="10813419">And I think that as this Court has now been refreshed by Mr. Taylor that the problem of the conflict with, and the question of interstate commerce was considered in those briefs and the Court rejected that argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="2729.449" offset="11021145">I must admit that this case to some extent is of limited application in view of the fact that this excursion boat in a true sense probably didn't operate in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.655" offset="11062000">It was operating in a very localized area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.072" offset="11083630">I would like to move on by my -- to the two questions that I think are of some importance that has been raised by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.836" offset="11146742">I think this question was raised briefly from the bench by the Court this morning as to whether there is a state issue in the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court that would prohibit this Court from rendering a decision at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.866" offset="11230856">I think respondent's counsel would like for this Court to find that there is such issue and I feel quite confident on page 14 and 15, they have argued that point well to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.213" offset="11300237">I think the -- the fact of that argument is that they are arguing the first decision, and I shouldn't say the first decision, I should say the preliminary decision in our Supreme Court in the case which is for review here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.445" offset="11365125">Mr. Taylor with design brought to the attention of our local Supreme Court in his petition for rehearing and pointed out that if the Colorado Supreme Court made the statement to which Continental has referred, and if that remained in the case then there was no need for four or five pages of argument or four or five pages of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.484" offset="11477347">That took care of it by itself and I think the Court realized that if they did retain this point of view that they were indeed making statements that were not necessary.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard H. Jewel</label>
            <text syncTime="3098.961" offset="12499257">Mr. Chief Justice Warren and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.419" offset="12525066">California is one of those states which has a Commission which varies in many respects with the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.188" offset="12568116">We call ours the Fair Employment Practice Commission but its duties and as I understand, the Colorado Commission, its jurisdictions are roughly comparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.399" offset="12608972">When our legislature enacted the law creating our Fair Employment Practice Commission, it stated its policy which I would I like to read to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.350" offset="12664769">It stated the policy to be as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.196" offset="12676159">“It is hereby declared as the public policy of this State that it is necessary to protect and safeguard the right and opportunity of all persons to seek, obtain, and hold employment without discrimination or abridgment on account of race, religious creed, color, national origin or ancestry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.916" offset="12762990">It is recognized that the practice of denying employment opportunity and discriminating in terms of employment for such reasons commence domestic strife and unrest, deprives the state of the fullest utilization of its capacities for development and advance, and substantially and adversely affects the interest of employees, employers and the public in general.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.694" offset="12862151">Now, it is in defense of this policy of California that we have asked leave of this Court to appear as amicus and it is in defense of this policy that I speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.491" offset="12917321">As we understand this case, this case poses a rather grave threat to that policy for us here in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.221" offset="12956296">I note that Continental in its petition states that on page 19 or in its brief states that they do not challenge the authority of Colorado under its police powers to enact fair employment legislation nor to apply such legislation to employees of interstate employers generally to employees of interstate employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.770" offset="13050441">But I think it's unfortunately true that the admission of the -- of Continental in this case would not be binding upon the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.516" offset="13089416">And the burden which the -- which the Continental seeks to urge upon this Court is not a burden which goes only to airline pilots, unfortunately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.969" offset="13135287">As I make it out, the airline pilots are only distinguishable from other employees of interstate commerce carriers and in that, there is a -- a rather particular and specified group of federal regulations which have to do with safety and since Mr. Green in this case has been certificated by the federal authorities, and so far as I know, there has been no word in this record to the effect that Mr. Green was in any way an unsafe pilot or was in any way uncertificated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.862" offset="13266840">That issue so far as the -- as the limitation of this -- of this problem to airline pilots seems to be questionable because the burden as the respondents allege is not a burden which is limited only to airline pilots but it applies generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.207" offset="13332250">The burden that they allege is one of multiplicity and they stated rather eloquently in their brief at pages 20, 21, 22, and 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.289" offset="13376554">They point out at such things as a fact that the various commissions have various numbers of commissioners who receive various salaries and that they have different means of enforcing these procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.624" offset="13433919">Some by penal sanction, others simply by persuasion, et cetera and they document this more fully for the Court in their Appendix A of their brief which describes in some great detail the multiplicity of state and federal or of state commissions having to do with this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.572" offset="13513644">This applies not only if there's a burden in Continental with respect to airline pilots, but I would think there would be so far as multiplicity is concerned, the burden also with stewardesses, perhaps they'd burden also with other Continental employees who are required to physically be -- to physically go from state to state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.550" offset="13597550">And I suspect the number of employees in this respect would be considerable since Continental operates in many states, and I presume, they have occasion for example to send accountants from one of their offices to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.719" offset="13654288">Well, there's any number of employees of Continental who must travel from state to state.</text>

            <text syncTime="3430.850" offset="13826800">In addition, and I have been told that -- that up to approximately 48% of all California employees for one purpose or another -- or another might be considered to be within -- within interstate to be engaged in interstate commerce or in occupations which affect interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="3562.797" offset="14354578">And to that purpose, it will consider such matters as the pervasiveness of the state legislation, a subject to be involved the need for uniformity versus the right of the state -- of the individual state to legislative matters to protect its own or in accordance with its own police powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.291" offset="14440573">We think that the whole case is simply a manifestation of the application of this doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="4448.960" offset="17899186">We've had thousands of cases involving this racial discrimination in employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.775" offset="17918516">And approximately 7% of these have involved interstate carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.846" offset="17934712">In the early years, there were many railroad cases and in these many dozens and dozens, in fact, a couple of hundred railroad cases, the railroads perhaps they squirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.463" offset="17981210">I don't know what went on behind their common experience, but they accepted the conciliation procedures of the state commission, the first Negro brakeman was put on in one railroad and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.125" offset="18035858">And these breakthroughs, each of them, although maybe only a handful of persons were concerned had an enormous significance.</text>

            <text syncTime="4493.234" offset="18076296">I need not belabor the point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4495.519" offset="18085491">In the case of the airlines, we have had to date done business with 25 airlines all of an interstate in New York alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4502.766" offset="18114435">Now, these airlines haven't gone screaming to the Civil Aeronautics Board to give them the statement of preemption to bail them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.792" offset="18142542">I might mention it has been suggested to me about the colloquy here this morning that the Arabian-American Oil Company didn't hesitate to go screaming to the Secretary of State when our state commission against discrimination was asserting jurisdiction over their employment practices in New York, and get a letter which stayed the hand of a commission for a time, made it hesitate, the matter had to go through the courts until that proceeding was settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="4539.069" offset="18259675">Not only in our experience was close to a hundred cases involving airlines, almost half of those involving flight crew of pilots, as well as hostesses and we had perhaps the dubious honor of having been responsible for the first Negro hostesses, Negro stewardesses on airlines in our region.</text>

            <text syncTime="5077.003" offset="20411434">I believe that it's inescapable and it's not disputed that in this case we have an order of a state commission which is unskilled in the field of aviation that has ordered a federally certificated commercial airline to hire a particular person as a pilot to fly its aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="5106.915" offset="20531075">This is the fact and tenor and meaning of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.916" offset="20551032">Now, how did the Commission get to that point?</text>
            <text syncTime="5116.484" offset="20569318">The Commission got to that point by acting as it is required to act under the Colorado statute in any case over which it has jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="5162.652" offset="20753951">Mr. Green arrived in Denver on June 24th.</text>
            <text syncTime="5166.497" offset="20769311">He was there for the 25th and 26th, and he took a link trainer check test and he had an interview and he had a flight test.</text>
            <text syncTime="5172.744" offset="20794389">Continental's decision after that action was that Green was eligible and was qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.701" offset="20818213">He was wired by another one of the supervisory people Wyler on July 5th that he hadn't been included in the July class.</text>
            <text syncTime="5188.113" offset="20855829">That wire went to his old home address in Arkansas instead of his Michigan address.</text>
            <text syncTime="5193.369" offset="20876831">So Mr. Green on the 8th called Continental, talked to Mr. Bell, Vice President of Personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.773" offset="20902431">Mr. Bell told him that he was eligible and was qualified, but he hadn't been included in the July class.</text>
            <text syncTime="5206.002" offset="20927404">The record in the case shows that there was a particular file where all of the eligible and qualified pilots named and applications were kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="5217.417" offset="20973066">On August 6th, right about August 6th which is a month later, the Associated Press news story which Continental saw from an Albuquerque newspaper, but which it described at some length in the record and the source of it of course was Mr. Green's discussion with the reporter in Lansing, Michigan and they picked up there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5242.628" offset="21073899">At that point, Continental, Mr. Bell exercising its judgment said, “Here's the man with not only nationwide notoriety, but he also has a fair employment practice cases pending against other aviation employer -- employers seeking a job.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.145" offset="21171911">We don't like this notoriety.</text>
            <text syncTime="5269.116" offset="21179852">I don't know if it's good for him or not, but we don't like it if he is going to follow ahead with those cases it will interrupt this training and service in Colorado.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.172" offset="21220080">So, it was at that point and upon receipt of that information that the company decided that Green wasn't qualified for the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.475" offset="21261249">There is no question about his being able to apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="6152.260" offset="24712443">And that the Department of Justice and others intervened as amici in the case in Colorado so that I would think that it would be perfectly logical for the Court to do what we believe they did hold no jurisdiction on three bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6173.271" offset="24796453">The statute doesn't cover it and burden on commerce and preemption, but obviously there's an argument on the other side but I think it's a fair construction of the opinion of the Colorado Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6191.777" offset="24870431">Now, I'd like to move, if the Court please, to the issue of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="6204.612" offset="24921840">So the discussion has already been had about Section 404 (b) of the Civil Aeronautics Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6213.820" offset="24958621">The language of that particular provision of the statute is sweeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="6220.565" offset="24985684">Also that language in substance is identical to Sections 31 and 216 (d) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6233.910" offset="25038973">This Court has -- had the Commerce Act anti-discrimination provisions before it in many cases, particularly the Mitchell case, the Henderson case and the Boynton case.</text>

            <text syncTime="6268.620" offset="25177840">And in Henderson, particularly, this Court pointed out that the material parts of Section 31 of the Commerce Act had been in that statute since 1887.</text>
            <text syncTime="6282.947" offset="25235205">And from the very beginning, the Interstate Commerce Commission had recognized its application to discriminations between white and Negro passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6292.138" offset="25271881">So from the very beginning, it was apparently upheld by the administrative agency that that anti-discrimination provision related to matters of racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6303.157" offset="25315976">In Mitchell, the Court points out that there was no intent by the Congress to exempt any discrimination from the coverage of the Act.</text>
