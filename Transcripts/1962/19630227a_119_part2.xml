            <text syncTime="141.943" offset="673165">Our position is simply this, that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment is a matter of decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.031" offset="713498">In other words, the wall of separation between church and state is a matter of decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.626" offset="739934">It is not an absolute, fixed, finite wall, and this Court has so stated on several occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.456" offset="775252">As a matter of fact, in Zorach, it was stated that when you get into the question of the separation between church and straight -- state, it is indeed a matter of decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.899" offset="821018">And, it was because of this very factor that this Court in Everson held that though religious exercises or religiousness was involved, that it still did not violate sufficiently the Establishment Clause as to constitute an abridgment of that Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.607" offset="891862">The same was true in McGowan, the Sunday Blue Law cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.160" offset="910043">The Court in that case held that, historically, there was no question about it but that the Sunday Blue Laws were laws which were established for the benefit of religion, from the day of rest, to keep holy the Sabbath day.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.881" offset="972946">As a matter of fact, under the Maryland statute in McGowan, the statute provides so that the day of rest, in order not to profane the Lord's Day.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.329" offset="1014742">So, we have this question of religiousness in McGowan, but this Court stated in that case that there was not a sufficient degree of abridgment of religiousness, so to speak, as to violate the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.509" offset="1079421">Now let's go, if we may, to the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.748" offset="1092378">This is the Murray case.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.986" offset="1101364">It is true that the rule of the Baltimore City schools provide that there shall be the Lord's Prayer and the reading of passages from the Bible.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.084" offset="1141802">This is a long established practice which goes far beyond the rule itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.420" offset="1171059">Historically, it will be -- it can be shown, were there's not a case up on demurrer.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.846" offset="1192793">It can be shown that the practice goes back at least as far as 1836 throughout the schools of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.181" offset="1226125">Now, the practice, we maintain, has something in it other than religiousness itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.073" offset="1273668">It is true that the Lord's Prayer, it is true that the Bible, sounds and religion has its roots in religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.504" offset="1299477">This, we do not deny.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.755" offset="1308463">We point out however, that the use of the Bible, the use of the Lord's Prayer in the morning exercises has a significant salutary effect in several respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.466" offset="1359245">First of all, it has a traditional teaching of moral and ethical values.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.857" offset="1384845">This, I believe even my Brother, Mr. Kerpelman, admitted when he stated that it was a beautiful prayer, the most beautiful prayer ever composed or at least many people believed that it was, that the literature of the Bible was historical and that it was the most widely read book of all books ever composed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3188.469" offset="12859288">I personally want to thank Mr. Burch for giving us a portion of his time to intervene here as amicus curiae and also to thank the Attorneys General of some 18 states of our sister states in the union who have joined with us as amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.521" offset="12919474">The appendix to our brief also contains a compilation of some-39 sister states who have similar provisions concerning the devotional exercise of some type in public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.930" offset="12981123">Mr. Chief Justice, a moment ago asked about Hawaii and the appendix there as a reference to the rule in Hawaii which does permit a devotional exercise but forbids the teaching of religion in the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.480" offset="13039323">We go along with the city solicitors from Baltimore's contention that this is primarily an exercise within the school to create a climate of wholesomeness, of moral and ethical standard rather than essentially that of religious service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.716" offset="13128244">However, we will go further than his contention in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.129" offset="13145903">I'll put it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.137" offset="13149978">We concur insofar as he goes in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.969" offset="13161263">We will go further and state that we feel before this Court, as again, the situation as to whether they should reevaluate this entire position which they have taken, including the position of the Court in the Engel case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3277.428" offset="13215180">We feel this can be distinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.265" offset="13222494">I disagree with Mr. Burch and I didn't agree with the Court's conclusion in the Engel case but; nonetheless, we feel that this case can be distinguished; however, I do feel that this line of cases are bringing before the Court a question of religion laid bare past its bones to its very essence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.322" offset="13302742">I think the Court is forced into the conclusion of two concepts whether it will consider that nontheism should override theism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.375" offset="13342971">The opponents in this case, the petitioners have, of their own volition and according to the decision, I think, of the Court particularly in the Torcaso case, have equated nontheism or atheism with a religion which it is entitled to that position under the umbrella of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.102" offset="13425831">Now, assuming that it is, then we have two concepts which are so diametrically imposed it to be neutrally exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.458" offset="13463239">And although the petitioner would have us believe that there is a ground of neutralism, there is a vacuum, as it were, which could be maintained in this field so that nobody would be injured, so that nobody's sensibilities would be stepped upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.387" offset="13526977">We assert that that is a fallacy, that once you say that you must remove the idea of theism and for what are -- time to elaborate, let's call this a theistic approach or a theistic climate in the school or to -- when you do away with that you are in effect giving in and surrendering to those who want a nontheistic climate, and that nontheistic climate is in effect, by indirection, giving a facial sanction to their religion, which is nontheism.</text>

            <text syncTime="3531.848" offset="14232806">And as a result of that case, it's been held that -- or at least the construction placed on it is that to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States can be a part of the ritual in the public schools as long as those who do not wish to take it can be excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.087" offset="14301769">Now, in 1954, the Congress of the United States inserted in that Pledge of Allegiance the clause, “One Nation under God” and that is what is in the official Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag today.</text>
