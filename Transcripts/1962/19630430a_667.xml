            <text syncTime="15.854" offset="166745">This case which comes to the Court on a writ to certiorari to the Supreme Court of Mississippi presents three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.537" offset="213556">The first is the right of counsel -- to counsel of a 25 year old Negro, arrested and convicted of rape and given a capital sentence in the State of Mississippi on and in the County of Madison.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.851" offset="282728">This Negro, being a functional illiterate being -- having -- had only a second grade education, having been arrested on July the 30th, 1961 and not having counsel assigned to him for either 52 or 53 days while he was detained in solitary detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.081" offset="379695">Having had no counsel at his confession, having had no counsel at his preliminary hearing, and having counsel assigned to him on his arraignment on the 21st of September.</text>

            <text syncTime="88.909" offset="459003">Mississippi Law requires it and I think it is conceded by all that he did have one on August the 3rd --</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="95.109" offset="483767">I see.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Morris B. Abram</label>
            <text syncTime="95.300" offset="484603">-- but it is not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.476" offset="493275">You will understand Mr. Justice Stewart that this record is somewhat fragmentary in view of the fact that we are claiming that he had ineffective counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.582" offset="529742">And of course the record I think reflects this.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.276" offset="544475">But in any event, he did have counsel appointed on the 21st when on the 22nd, the venire was drawn, his counsel announced that he was ready for trial on the 25th.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.064" offset="615633">Now, the 22nd would’ve been a Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.788" offset="626500">Saturday and Sunday would’ve intervened and he proposed and agreed to go to trial on the 25th the following Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.203" offset="660146">So, the first question that we present to the Court is the right of counsel and the effectiveness of counsel is the second question.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.104" offset="699747">The third question is another due process question which deals with the admissibility of a confession in this case and the fruits of the confession consisting of three items or physical exhibits which are important to the prosecution in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.409" offset="776965">And we finally submit that this confession was submitted by the Court to the jury under an incorrect constitutional instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.695" offset="826180">Now with respect to the facts of this case, may it please the Court, this defendant was arrested on the night of September or rather July the 30th, 1961 when apparently he was sleeping in his home in the sawmill quarters of a sawmill village in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.658" offset="914056">Some time that night between the hours of 12 and 2 in the morning, this 14 year old white girl had been raped at a time when she had immediately before had been seated in an automobile with her 17 year old white companion.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.484" offset="985318">The story that she told is that a Negro came up and put a knife in the window and around the neck of her companion who was seated on the right hand side of the car, she being on the left hand side of the front sit.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.701" offset="1042160">And after an attempt to rob and after taking away the knife and the watch and wallet of her boyfriend, he had them drive a short distance and then had to get out of the car and had her submit to a rape with a boy lying on the ground, her friend lying on the ground beside but afraid to move or afraid to offer any resistance because of the fact that the accused had a knife.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.079" offset="1143724">In any event, this occurred between the hours of 12 and 2 on the 30th of July.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.549" offset="1173608">Now, from the record it appears that the sole reason for the arrest of this defendant was because a police dog which was taken to the scene of the alleged crime picked up a scent and headed in the direction of the sawmill quarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.227" offset="1252289">Despite what the State of Mississippi says in its brief, that’s all of the evidence that points to the probable cause for the arrest of this defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.021" offset="1315506">I'm speaking of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.046" offset="1319581">You’re right Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.101" offset="1327731">Now, moreover, it appears that the accused or defendant in this case was one of maybe eight people or nine, I forget which, who were picked up in this dragnet drawn over the sawmill quarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.618" offset="1397844">At least as far as the record says, eight or nine other suspects were rounded up.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.290" offset="1432534">Now, with respect to identification with which this Court is not really concerned I supposed, but it’s interesting that on the trial of this case, neither the prosecutrix nor her friend ever identified or were asked to identify the defendant accused who was given a capital sentence.</text>

            <label>Mr. Morris B. Abram</label>
            <text syncTime="356.183" offset="1528142">That was -- I think the Court will find that was with respect to the testimony outside the presence of a jury on the question of admissibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.739" offset="1562311">I'm not sure about that but I'd liked to look at it.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.908" offset="1574954">But at least, she was never pointed out -- she never pointed out this defendant as the person who did commit the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.696" offset="1610167">Now, with respect to this defendant, he was arrested about 4 a.m.in his home, he was picked up in this dragnet.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.243" offset="1648306">He was taken to the Madison County Jail in Canton, Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.217" offset="1668263">And he was held there until 11 a.m. That is on a Sunday morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.270" offset="1692400">And then, he was taken to the Hinds County, Mississippi Patrol Headquarters and he was held there until a confession was obtained at 4 o’clock that afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.023" offset="1739421">As far as the record is concerned, we don’t know whether he had breakfast.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.935" offset="1759065">We don’t know whether he had lunch.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.435" offset="1769096">The only thing the record shows is that when outside the presence of the jury, the officer who had him in custody was asked whether or not he did have breakfast, he merely said that breakfast facilities were available in the Hinds County or at the Madison County Jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.979" offset="1839313">It is almost apparent that he had no sleep.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.676" offset="1850075">If he were -- the fact, the person who committed the crime, he would have gone to bed around 2 or 2:30.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.644" offset="1877974">He would have been arrested at 4 and he would have been held without sleep certainly from the time of his arrest until the time that he confessed at 4 o’clock the following afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.763" offset="1930428">His confession was obtained after he says he was accused -- he was told by Mr. Snodgrass, one of the officers under whose detention he was, that if he didn’t confess, they were going to take him back to Canton, Madison County where the crime had been committed and let a mob crowd get him, he used the words mob crowd.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.358" offset="2028753">Outside the presence of a jury, the Sheriff Noble says of this threat, “I wasn’t present if he made that statement” Mr. John, but he didn’t deny the statement was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.673" offset="2086013">He says that he did -- wasn’t present if it were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.818" offset="2098657">Now, I must candidly say that all of the persons present in the room denied that there was any coercion or any threat used against this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.948" offset="2135124">It is agreed that he was put on polygraph machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.593" offset="2149752">It is agreed that James Matlock who have been in -- riding around with the accused before the incident occurred, that is the rape occurred, did -- was arrested at the same time and it was told to the accused that his accomplice that evening at least in the robbery or the planned robbery had confessed.</text>

            <text syncTime="534.678" offset="2242121">Was that true?</text>

            <label>Mr. Morris B. Abram</label>
            <text syncTime="536.187" offset="2248077">Yes, I think as far as I know it was Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.874" offset="2262915">Now, with respect to that, the record shows a very interesting colloquy between the defense counsel and James Matlock who was the companion of the accused in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.021" offset="2319444">Finally, it ends up and he agrees that he doesn’t have sense enough to testify because he testified one way and testified another way and finally just began to give no answers at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.694" offset="2362180">The record is right interesting in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.466" offset="2373256">In any event, after the accused in this case, the defendant confessed, he was taken back to his home and there, a watch, a knife and a pair of pants were recovered which are physically exhibits in the court’s office.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.275" offset="2432502">He was – this were picked up around 6:30 or 7 o’clock at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.520" offset="2457475">Now, a preliminary examination is required by Mississippi law and almost within the terms and language of Federal Rule 5 without unnecessary delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.969" offset="2507212">And it is the duty of the examining magistrate to initiate a commitment proceeding if that should appear to be required and it is his duty also in the language of the Act to examine into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.516" offset="2565413">As far as the record shows, there was no counsel at this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.547" offset="2585579">He was indicted on the 20th of September, 1961 and it’s interesting to note that this could be a critical phase in the defense of the accused because the Mississippi Code says that before swearing any grand jury as such, he shall be examined by the Court on all matters touching his qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.835" offset="2670738">After swearing in the grand jury, no objection shall be raised and it shall be presumptively assumed that the grand jury is properly empanelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.219" offset="2716296">Now, this defendant was arraigned on the 21st which was a Thursday of September, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.659" offset="2750046">On Friday, the 22nd, he -- the venire was drawn and counsel stood up in Court and said the counsel was ready for trial in this capital case on the 25th of September which would’ve been three days later with a Saturday and Sunday intervening.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.974" offset="2827264">Now, the trial did occur on the 25th.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.402" offset="2836982">No change of venue was asked though the statute of the State of Mississippi is very broad in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.018" offset="2859447">It says that there can be a change of venue if there is prejudgment or ill will against the defendant in the county where the crime is committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.762" offset="2906467">The State at the trial of the case presented 12 witnesses and I think this is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.922" offset="2931022">One of them was from Washington, D.C. Four of them were from Jackson, Mississippi which is an adjoining county and because of the language of this Court in Avery versus Alabama, I would point out that Jackson County -- Hinds County, Mississippi is a county of 185,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.982" offset="3007300">Seven witnesses were from Madison County which has a population of 33,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.383" offset="3032900">I might point out that that makes 12 witnesses who were presented by the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.389" offset="3064978">In addition, there was of course the possibility of inquiring of many other witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.857" offset="3086817">For example, what about the man who possessed the dog?</text>
            <text syncTime="749.892" offset="3102908">Or what would he have said with respect to the set and where it led him.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.101" offset="3119731">But he was never put on the stand by the prosecution and the defense never put anybody on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.727" offset="3146271">The defense only put the accused on the stand during the period that the jury had retired in order to investigate the legality of the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.266" offset="3192456">Now, during the course of the trial, the Court will find that 11 times, attorney for the defense objected to leading questions after they had been answered.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.698" offset="3238118">Seven of those objections were sustained but he never once moved strike from the record and the jury’s consideration, the answers to leading questions on which his objections had been sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.058" offset="3287646">He failed to object to a reference to a confession prior to its introduction into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.295" offset="3312515">And he let pass the equation by the prosecuting attorney of the word of white with American when an FBI agent was being examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.521" offset="3345429">I say this is not something fatal, but at least gives a flavor of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.719" offset="3370297">Now the defense counsel did file a motion for new trial in which he raised the question of a coerced confession and admission of certain items of evidence and the case was then taken to the Supreme Court of Mississippi which found no error.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.892" offset="3434977">And then at that stage, ACLU counsel came into the case and filed a suggestion of error which I understand of the Mississippi practice, my Brother could tell me if I’m wrong, is equivalent of a motion for rehearing in the Supreme Court of Mississippi.</text>

            <text syncTime="873.278" offset="3596518">And I might add in respect to that, there was half a page of cross examination of the prosecutrix in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.420" offset="3625044">Now, I understand the problem in that kind of a case with a young girl, but in any event, it just indicates how fragmentary and how cursory the defense was.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.289" offset="3680528">Now, I say that this case, in as much as it complains of the effectiveness of counsel of course presents to the Court a record on which we have to rely and I think that a court can ask itself certain questions based upon the facts and the clear inferences from this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.224" offset="3768299">For example, it would not be normal I assume to have in a record where a counsel is willing to go to trial on the following Monday in a capital case in objection by him strongly making the point which he didn’t make that an adjournment was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.425" offset="3853040">I would’ve thought it would’ve been rather difficult in as much as you’re arguing for the effect -- against the effectiveness of counsel for him to have made the point with respect to the exclusion of Negroes from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.997" offset="3907375">But there are matters of which this Court can take judicial notice which show the type of exclusion that you’ve got in this case or the point that could’ve been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.783" offset="3942484">For example, Madison County is a county of 23,637 Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.308" offset="3980622">Of them, 10,366 are of the age eligible to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.387" offset="4008939">Of that group, only 5.9% are registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.604" offset="4037778">The county has 9267 whites and of those, 5622 are of voting age.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.288" offset="4084485">The point is that out of that tremendous Negro population which consists of 648 -- tens percent of the county, only 5.9% are registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.957" offset="4127222">Now, what's the importance of this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.721" offset="4138297">The importance is precisely that importance which Judge Reeves in the Fifth Circuit pointed in the Seal’s case in which this Court denied certiorari that where as in Mississippi at that time, the whole construction of the jury system depends and is based upon the electorate, you can’t conceivably have anything but a systematic exclusion of Negroes from the grand jury and the petit jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.088" offset="4247698">Moreover, the thing isn't built into the system as its presently operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.801" offset="4266611">In 1954, the Mississippi Constitution was amended to provide new methods of registration, with two subjective cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.131" offset="4303914">Does the person who wished to register understand the duties of citizenship, very subjective? And second, can he give a reasonable interpretation of the Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.833" offset="4354696">Now, when they passed this Constitutional Amendment, they put a Grandfather’s Clause in it and provided that all those already registered could continue to vote without re-registration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.208" offset="4396178">Now at that time according to Mr. J.P. Coleman, then the Attorney General of the State of Mississippi, there were 500,000 Negroes of voting age in 1954 when this Grandfather’s Clause was built in to the system of whom only 22,000 were eligible to vote or 4.4% of the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.383" offset="4488861">Now these are matters which effective counsel could’ve dealt with at the appropriate time in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.186" offset="4520103">And counsel of course did not make the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.888" offset="4538911">It is hardly likely in as much as if he wanted to plead for a change of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.024" offset="4567437">It is hardly likely that counsel in this case would’ve made the points which have recently been made at another doctrine of which I think the Court can take judicial notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.894" offset="4610905">The Civil Rights Commission's Report on the State of Mississippi, signed by [Inaudible], former president American Bar Association, and Erwin Griswold and others. Certainly, some mentioned of this kind of an in build prejudice in the very system and particularly in this county, it would appear to me, it could've made by effective counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.586" offset="4705677">Now, going back specifically to the failure to have counsel at the various stages of this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.542" offset="4737546">He was denied counsel as I say for 53 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.628" offset="4757922">The right to counsel under the Due Process Clause does not mean the right to counsel by form only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.576" offset="4785716">I think the Court will have to go back to the bedrock case, Powell versus Alabama in which this Court said that duty is not discharged by an assignment at such time and under such circumstances as to preclude the giving of effective aid in the preparation and trial of the case. The Court speaks of -- from arraignment of trial beginning when consultation, thorough going investigation and preparation were vitally important and they called this a critical phase of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.470" offset="4905253">Now, I recognize the Court has not yet decided the case so far as I know which says that counsel is needed or were constitutionally required at the time of the questioning of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.053" offset="4963558">But if the Court will look at its language in Crooker, and look at its language in Siena versus Jay case, I think the Court will agree that if the failure to provide counsel at these stages under the circumstances, the total circumstances of a case amounts to the man not having a fair trial, then there would be a constitutional right of which the accused would've been deprived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.699" offset="5078183">There are several other cases I think which go fairly far pointing in this direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.843" offset="5098768">For example, Haley versus Ohio, in which a 15-year old Negro was questioned in relays for five hours and then, there was a confession shown by his accomplices to him and then he was held incommunicado for three days and the Court said that the absence of an adult at this stage voided the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.109" offset="5187793">Now, here we have an illiterate Negro, afraid of his life, accused of what would be in the State of Mississippi and in the context there, the worst possible crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.090" offset="5235754">Held 53 days, he was held 12 hours before he confessed, there is no real evidence that he was fed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.353" offset="5264802">There is his statement that he was told that if he didn't confess, he would be taken back to the jail in Madison County where a mob crowd would get him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.266" offset="5300433">He was forced to submit to a polygraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.262" offset="5312449">The accomplice was used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.164" offset="5324048">He was in my judgment an easily manipulable man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.910" offset="5342960">And with respect to the mob crowd in the county, the record in this case shows that the District Attorney who prosecuted him filed to the Court a paper in which he asked that the defendant here be detained not in Madison County where the crime was committed, but that he be detained in Hinds County because he said, and this is his language, “The facilities for the safekeeping of the defendant are not available.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.446" offset="5449122">Now Mississippi puts a different construction on that than -- that I had when I immediately read it, but in any event, there, the language appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.593" offset="5493739">Now with respect to the failure to grant this defendant counsel at his preliminary hearing, I think we must bear in mind first of all that the preliminary hearing is guaranteed by state law and it is an important stage of a hearing particularly for this man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.154" offset="5568031">There it would have been possible for counsel to have made the judgment whether or not he wanted to cross examine the State's witnesses to find out what kind of a case they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.305" offset="5608573">It would've been possible at that time if the man had his head beaten as some of the evidence outside the record demonstrates in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.093" offset="5643786">He could've been looked at by the examining magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.000" offset="5659355">Moreover, the officers who did get his confession could've been examined separately and each of them put on a record and if there was any confusion or any contradiction, all of these contradictions could've been used on the cross examination of these officers at the trial in chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.674" offset="5730095">There were four persons present in that room where he confessed and I'm reasonably sure as I am sure any trial lawyer would agree that you would never get all four to say the same thing and if you had it in the record, there could have been a more successful cross examination of the persons who procured the confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.145" offset="5851930">Generally he -- in my practice, he would've been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.265" offset="5868440">In the case of Hamilton versus Alabama, this Court in 1961 said that in the case of Alabama, in the State of Alabama where there was a defendant accused of rape and the accused had no lawyer appointed for him at the arraignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.783" offset="5950464">The fact in that case, he was prejudiced so that his constitutional rights were deprived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.711" offset="5978258">Now, it's interesting that the insanity plea in Alabama could've been raised at the arraignment and also the question of the systematic exclusion of jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.024" offset="6019427">Certainly in the State of Mississippi, at least as far as its law is concerned and the case that there has been cited to us, it appeared that you must challenge this grand jury's composition before it is sworn and that would've occurred of course before his indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.700" offset="6094137">In Reece versus Georgia, this Court held in 1955, that where there was no challenge to the grand jury before an indictment and the accused had no counsel until arraignment, the court reversed when there was evidence of the exclusion of Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.616" offset="6165817">I think that the question with respect to the time of appointment of counsel is adamantly and inexplicably intertwined with the question of the effectiveness of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.365" offset="6212838">This is not Avery versus Alabama and I should like to discuss that in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.251" offset="6232377">In Avery versus Alabama which was decided by this Court in 1939, you had a case in which an accused was arrested shortly before the 31st of March 1938, counsel was appointed on the 21st of March, 1938 and counsel put him on trial or went to trial on the 24th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.799" offset="6318582">Now there are several things that are important about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.378" offset="6332897">Those dates occurred between a Monday and a Thursday, not between a Friday and a Monday, not over the weekend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.566" offset="6365602">Second, there were two attorneys appointed in that case, and third as Mr. Justice Black pointed out in his decision, there was no suggestion that a better result could've been obtained or a better trial had, had there been more time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.889" offset="6422967">Furthermore, as Mr. Justice Black pointed out in that case, I believe it was Bibb County, Alabama, the county seat had less than a thousand persons in it and the trial was a trial of a very simple shooting in which there were almost no witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.291" offset="6500498">Now, here is the case on the other hand involving witnesses in a county of 185,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.273" offset="6528502">The county in which the crime occurred had 33,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.156" offset="6543966">The State presented 12 witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.977" offset="6555251">There were numerous other witnesses that could've been presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.507" offset="6569357">The appendices to the brief which are not in the record shows quite clearly I think what might have been presented by a competent counsel, if competent counsel -- I don't mean competent, effective counsel had been available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.222" offset="6628289">Now Your Honors, under the Betts versus Brady doctrine, a system of guidelines with respect to the right of counsel have been established which make the following elements crucial in the court's consideration of the totality of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.417" offset="6705089">The first is ignorance of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.238" offset="6712299">Here, you've got a functional illiterate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.063" offset="6723584">There's a lack of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.853" offset="6734764">His familiarity with legal procedures whether the issues are complex or simple and the atmosphere of prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.518" offset="6773426">Without any question in this case, the atmosphere of the prejudice was pervasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.592" offset="6801742">Now, I turn to the question with respect to the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.027" offset="6819506">For in as much as the accused was never pointed out by either the girl or her companion as the one who committed the crime, what you have in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.821" offset="6866631">You've got a knife, you've got a Timex watch and you've got a pair of pants over which there is much controversy, but all of these were obtained as a result of the confession which occurred some 12 hours after his arrest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1765.314" offset="7164635">And my feeling is that under the facts of this case, this defendant needed a lawyer perhaps more than most defendants because he was a Negro, he was in a county in which there are 64.8% Negroes, and moreover, he had been accused of a crime then which there was nothing worst of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.692" offset="7262124">Now with respect to his confession, there was much here that was not investigated by a counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.198" offset="7288142">Was his head touched?</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.953" offset="7295143">Was he dazed when he was sent back to his home for picking up the pants and the getting of the knife and the watch?</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.303" offset="7324609">If it could've been shown that he had in fact been beaten, we would have fallen under the doctrine of Mapp versus Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.288" offset="7360554">In any event, an inquiry might have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.362" offset="7376854">There isn't in my judgment anything in this record which indicates probable cause for the arrest and under the doctrine of the Court recently announced Wong Sun case where the admission is obtained as the result of an illegal arrest, it is not admissible and if you tie the doctrine of Wong Sun versus -- Mapp versus Ohio, then I think you would exclude the fruits of the illegal detention and does the illegal confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.411" offset="7500988">And if you did to exclude this confession and excluded the fruits that were obtained from it, the State would have had nothing that tied this defendant with the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.370" offset="7552815">Now, the final point I would like to make is it that jury in this case was clearly directed by wrong constitutional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.969" offset="7595238">The judge when he charged the jury, and I must admit that the charge was a charge that was requested by the defense counsel, he charged him as he charged the jury as follows: The Court instructs the jury for the defendant that if you believe, I'm reading the record at page 7, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.370" offset="7728880">The Court instructs the jury for the defendant that if you believe from the evidence that the alleged confession wasn't true, you should disregard it, or if you believe from the evidence that was made under the influence of hope or fear, you may take this into account in determining what weight or credit if any, you may attach to it as evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2219.794" offset="8982549">There is absolutely nothing in this record to indicate that there was any coercion whatsoever used to get the confession from this petitioner except his lone statement out of the premise of the jury to the effect that they've told them they were going to take him back to Canton and let a mob crowd him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.222" offset="9076276">Well, I submit those things are usually found and practically all confession cases that where a person confesses and finds himself in court confronted with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2263.554" offset="9157569">I want say that this counsel, court appointed counsel told him to say that or whether he dreamed of that himself but suffice then to say, the Court inquired very carefully into the voluntary nature of the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.392" offset="9208978">And incidentally on that score, the reason for bringing all these witnesses from Hinds County, who were witnesses to the confession, is this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2990.731" offset="12066252">He filed an affidavit attached to this brief made of -- before my Brother Wulf here of notary public, that on the morning that this petitioner was arraigned from his office in Jackson, Mississippi he called the circuit judge at the courthouse in Canton and that the judge he -- to tell him that he had been employed by the family of this petitioner to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.341" offset="12204701">And that this judge and I had assumed to believe of either one of you Honorable gentlemen, then of this particular judge, that this judge personally threatened him and told him his life would be in danger if he came to Canton, Mississippi to defend this man and that he followed the judge's suggestion and didn't come.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.378" offset="12304906">Well, what's left behind that affidavit; I had to get an affidavit from Judge Henry to counteract that thing and in his affidavit he says, the only thing true in Mr. Higgs' affidavit is that he did call me.</text>

            <text syncTime="3068.173" offset="12376064">He called Judge Henry just as he was about to respond to the motion of the court appointed counsel to draw a special venire of I think 60 men, get him out of the courtroom, did tell him that he had been approached to represent this man, says Henry told him that he had already appointed this lawyer but that he was going to represent him, I suggest you get right on up here to the courthouse and he hasn't come yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.552" offset="12509602">But that the interesting aspect to that affidavit of Mr. Higgs, if there's any truth at all in it while he would condemn, derelict -- so-called derelictions on the part experienced court appointed attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.572" offset="12569684">I call the Court's attention to this second sentence in the affidavit.</text>

            <text syncTime="4207.877" offset="16934849">Capital of the state, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="4210.020" offset="16943417">Now, I want to make two other observations then I'm through.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.392" offset="16960972">The first is that with respect to the material which appears outside the record and which was brought up by counsel opposite that there were some Negroes on the grand jury panel and two Negroes put on the venire to hear this case, ought to be struck -- stricken in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4233.719" offset="17038294">The recent case of the Fifth Circuit, the Seals case, I think is rather interesting on what we mean or what the courts mean by exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4245.411" offset="17085001">And mister or rather Judge Reeves said this, “Actually, whether the presence of a few Negroes on a venire containing many names is evidence tending to prove or to disprove racial discrimination, depends upon the proportions of Negroes and whites who are qualified for jury service.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4261.886" offset="17150934">Citing Reece versus Georgia, fairness and selection does not require proportionate representation of races upon a jury venire.</text>
            <text syncTime="4270.288" offset="17184475">It is nonetheless true that the very decided variations and proportions of Negroes and whites on jury list from racial proportions in the population, which variations are not explained in a long continued furnished -- efficient evidence of systematic exclusion of Negroes from jury service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.582" offset="17257723">And then they -- it quotes Brown versus Allen, “Of course, token summoning of Negroes for jury service does not comply with equal protection.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4296.679" offset="17290115">And I submit the competent counsel in this case or rather effective counsel in this case or counsel that had time to prepare this case could certainly have raised the question with respect to systematic exclusion, a case in which the exclusion is in-built, in through and because of the voting system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.100" offset="17367751">Now finally, my brother mentioned that I applied to make this a Mallory case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4323.150" offset="17395963">I want the Court to understand that while I do feel that the circumstances of this confession, having been obtained when I presume that they -- could've been possible for the State of Mississippi to provide a preliminary examination, raises the issues of Mallory but I particularly call to the Court's attention to another issue and that is that this man was arrested by virtue of the fact that the dog sniffed from the scene of the incident into the sawmill quarters and the words in the record are, “He took the truck and headed west and crossed the cotton field in the direction of the sawmill quarters.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4367.020" offset="17571401">We don't know what happened after that but we do know from the record that eight or nine other suspects were rounded up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4375.901" offset="17606928">Now, if there were no probable cause, what the State of Mississippi has done here is to arrest a group of people who happen to live in a certain section of town and have obtained from one a confession under the circumstances that we've already described and I suggest this is not probable cause, the detention was without probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4400.761" offset="17706402">The confession resulted from that illegal detention and illegal arrest, just as much as it if it were a material seized without a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4409.845" offset="17742764">The whole fruit of the investigation is suspect and poisonous and consequently the confession is of no use in a constitutional sense.</text>
