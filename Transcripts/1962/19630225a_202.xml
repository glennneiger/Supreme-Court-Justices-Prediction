            <text syncTime="34.029" offset="239470">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.469" offset="253262">The question here presented for decision today involves the extent of the right of a prisoner to be heard on a second or successive motion under Section 2255 of Title 28 of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.805" offset="338631">The facts in the case are simple and undisputed and quite important to determination herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.956" offset="379173">On January 19, 1959, the petitioner appeared before the United States District Court for the Northern District of California where he was charged with having taken three days prior thereto, approximately $220 from a federally insured bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.943" offset="467153">After explanation by the Court at this hearing, the petitioner waived his right to counsel, waived his right to indictment, consented to proceed by way of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.995" offset="535385">The information was then filed and read and the petitioner entered a guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.692" offset="566105">Several weeks later, in February of 1959, the petitioner again appeared before the sentencing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.002" offset="607378">He was asked before a sentence was pronounced if he had anything to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.856" offset="630784">An exchange then ensued between the petitioner and the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.759" offset="650428">The petitioner reported to the judge that he had been a narcotics addict on and off for quite awhile, and he requested that he'd be sent to Springfield or to Lexington for treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.651" offset="706017">The judge accepted his statement and recommended that the petitioner be sent to a medical facility for treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.647" offset="750007">Thereupon, the petitioner was sentenced to a 15-year term and he is now incarcerated in a federal penitentiary in the State of Washington.</text>

            <text syncTime="205.708" offset="926177">The record does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.665" offset="942059">Petitioner, appearing in proper person, filed a 2255 motion in January of 1960, asking that the Court vacate his sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.399" offset="1000991">As grounds therefore, he alleged only very broad conclusions and they were largely conclusions of law or they were mixed conclusions of law and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.841" offset="1066715">The District Court in California, quite properly I might add a very little attention to this petition, the Court said that defendant's motion, although replete with conclusions, sets forth no facts upon which these conclusions can be founded, and for this reason alone, the Court may deny the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.095" offset="1159711">The Court then went on to state that they had inspected the files and records, and these conclusively showed that the petitioner was entitled to no relief and so the motion was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.754" offset="1214360">Some seven months later, the petitioner again appearing in proper person filed the 2255 motion which is before this Honorable Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.219" offset="1260231">In this intervening seven-month period, the petitioner took to heart what the Court said in its first decision about his failure to allege any basic facts and he very carefully drafted another pro se petition supported by a memorandum and buttressed by an affidavit in which he clearly alleges that he was deprived of substantial constitutional rights and that during the proceedings when he waived his right to counsel and so forth, and when he was sentenced, that he was under the influence of narcotic drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.953" offset="1435146">His affidavit very specifically details this ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.330" offset="1460642">He states that he was confined in the Sacramento County Jail from January 16 until February 18, 1959, that during this period, he received narcotic drugs, administered by medical authorities, attendant at the jail, and this was due to the fact that he was a known addict, that he was under the influence of a drug during the time of what he refers to as his trial, obviously the proceeding I referred to before.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.183" offset="1592090">In concluding his memorandum, in support of his motion, he requested that a hearing be held to enable him to present evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="404.574" offset="1721657">The District Court refused to entertain his second motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.763" offset="1746422">The Court stated that no reason was given or was apparent to the Court while the petitioner could not and should not have raised the issue of mental incompetency at the time of his first motion, the first motion that alleged only conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.227" offset="1816325">So the Court refused to entertain the petition, but in a footnote to that decision, the Court again made the boiler plate assertion that it had reviewed the entire files and records and it found there was no merit in petitioner's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.582" offset="1885706">Of course, this is a real bootstrap operation because the claims made by petitioner were completely involving matters outside the record and on which the record could cast no light.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.116" offset="2059786">However, the probation officer's report went before the judge at the time of sentencing.Now this -- in this jurisdiction, at least, that is a confidential report.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="505.214" offset="2124257">We'll recess now, Mr. Vinson.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.899" offset="2179009">Mr. Vinson, you may continue your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="fred_m_vinson_jr" startTime="521.515" stopTime="1166.174">
            <label>Mr. Fred M. Vinson, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="521.515" offset="2189458">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.828" offset="2198653">Just prior to the luncheon recess, I had almost completed the statement of facts of the case at which time Mr. Justice Stewart, I believe, inquired as to whether the judge who entertained the -- the judge who sentenced the prisoner and the judge who entertained the successive motions was aware of the fact that the -- that the petitioner had received narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.321" offset="2320697">On the record before this Court, there is no indication for such awareness but in a footnote 11 of the Government's brief, the Government goes outside the record and points out that the probation report, which was before the judge at the time of sentence, confirms the fact that the petitioner was a known addict and did, in fact, receive medical treatment at the time of his incarceration in the Sacramento Jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.325" offset="2452668">After the denial -- rather the refusal to entertain the second 2255 motion, the petitioner duly appealed to the Ninth Circuit which, in essence, denied the appeal on the same ground stated in the District Court's opinion and this procedure before this Honorable Court then followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.996" offset="2567398">The relief sought here by the petitioner involves a reversal and a remand to the sentencing court with a hearing to be ordered before that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.911" offset="2622986">This is a procedural matter only but I would like to point out that it concerns the procedural right to be heard on a very substantial constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.732" offset="2698324">We should first turn to the statute involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.360" offset="2720789">And without laboring the statute, I do wish to call two sentences to the Court's attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.383" offset="2752867">First, the statute states that unless the motion and the files and records of the case “conclusively show” that the petitioner is entitled to no relief, the Court shall grant a prompt hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.339" offset="2816711">The statute also states, and this is crucial language in this matter, that the sentencing court shall not be required to entertain a second or successive motion for similar relief on behalf of the same prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.964" offset="2911274">It is petitioner's view that this statutory language with reference to successive motions, does not give the sentencing court the power to refuse to entertain a successive 2255 motion when new uncontroverted grounds for relief are raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.444" offset="3033109">This Court has never passed directly upon this question of successive motions and the sentencing court's exercise of jurisdiction to entertain them.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.631" offset="3081906">We should first turn to the landmark case of United States v. Hayman, decided by this Court in 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.064" offset="3123597">In that case, the Court goes very exhaustively into the genesis of Section 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.361" offset="3164766">The Court quotes with approval, a report of the judicial conference, which was submitted to the appropriate congressional committees where the judicial conference stated in reference to 2255, that as a remedy, this Section was intended to be as broad as habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.358" offset="3280854">Further in Hayman, this Court held that nowhere in the history of Section 2255 was there any evidence that there was any purpose to impinge or limit petitioner's right of collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.153" offset="3364028">And I quote from Hayman, “On the contrary, the sole purpose was to minimize the difficulties encountered in habeas corpus hearings by affording the same rights in another and more convenient forum”, that forum being the sentencing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.938" offset="3451173">With this guidepost and in the absence of this Court's treatment of the precise subject, we must look to some of the landmark cases involving the great writ, habeas corpus, that this Court has decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.404" offset="3517001">First, there is the case of Salinger v. Loisel, where this Court held that previous applications were proper for the courts to consider in exercising their judicial discretion involving successive habeas corpus applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.033" offset="3615535">But immediately following that enunciation in Salinger, the Court quotes from Ex parte Cuddy, with approval, and in Ex parte Cuddy, Mr. Justice Field said, and I quote, “The action of the court or justice on the second application will naturally be affected to some degree by the character of the Court or officer to whom the first application was made, and the fullness of the consideration given to it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="912.878" offset="3754924">I call to the Court's attention the fact that in this case, no consideration, no area in Court has ever been given to petitioner's allegations with respect to his deprivation of constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.297" offset="3828590">Next -- the next landmark of habeas corpus case is the case of Waley v. Johnston, decided by this Court in 1942, when the Court said that on petitioner's earlier application for a writ of coram nobis, the same issue was not raised as that which was here presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.243" offset="3928377">The earlier application was denied for insufficiency upon its face and without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.213" offset="3956276">There is thus no basis for the holding of the District Court, and the Supreme Court, thereupon, vacated the appellate court's judgment and remanded for a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.424" offset="4005073">This case -- these facts are also present in this case for new allegations were made in the second motion by petitioner upon which no hearing has been afforded.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.313" offset="4060662">The case of Price v. Johnston was decided by this Court in 1948 at a time when what ultimately became 2255 was pending in the Congress of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.436" offset="4125132">I feel that language in the Price v. Johnston case, when viewed in the framework of Hayman, may be determinative in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.734" offset="4186258">In Price v. Johnston, the Court was dealing with the fourth successive application of a prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.270" offset="4216456">And the Court stated that there's been no proper occasion prior to this fourth application for the matters raised to be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.243" offset="4252296">I quote, “But here, the three prior applications did not raise the issue now under consideration, and the three prior refusals to discharge petitioner can have no bearing or weight on the disposition to be made of the new matter raised in the fourth petition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.286" offset="4336515">If Hayman means what it says that relief under 2255 is as broad as that afforded by habeas corpus, this language in Price v. Johnston is determinative of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.462" offset="4425226">I have not gone into any exhaustive analysis of the various decisions involving this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.143" offset="4459917">In the circuit courts of our land, I have not done this frankly because I believe they cast more confusion than light on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.832" offset="4518745">I would like to, however, to call your attention to one case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia sitting en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.427" offset="4569109">This is a case of Smith versus United States, cited in my brief, where the Court meet head on the problem of interpreting the statutory language involving the Court's jurisdiction, the Court's discretion rather in entertaining successive motions for the same relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.064" offset="4675584">In dealing with the 2255 motion, the Court of Appeals in this Circuit, sitting en banc, held that such a motion, and I quote, “is required to be entertained by the sentencing court when it presents ground not theretofore presented and determined,” such as the case here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1801.589" offset="7309772">In support, the Government cites much legislative history but unfortunately almost all of it concerns Section 2244 rather than the Section we are here faced with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.506" offset="7357419">However, I call your attention to the fact that what became 2255 in its second draft in the Congress contained a one year limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.047" offset="7399528">A prisoner had only one year from the time of sentencing to bring a motion hereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.046" offset="7419591">The Judicial Conference Committee on Habeas Corpus headed by Chief Judge Parker in 1947 submitted a report to the conference which was made known to the Congress in which they disapproved this one year limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.951" offset="7487195">Thereafter, the statutory language we're here interpreting involving successive motions appeared in the statute as a substitute for the one year limitation with no explanatory or clarifying material with respect to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.217" offset="7552188">But I think it's very obvious that legislatively the Congress drops the one year limitation because it did not want to limit by a very mechanical means of prisoner in asserting constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.625" offset="7649886">In portions of its brief, the Government treats this case as a problem primarily involving judicial administration and court congestion, both of which are matters of great concern to the mentioned bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.753" offset="7710386">However, they are not primary considerations here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.013" offset="7723447">Our primary consideration is to see that the prisoner who raises clear issues involving deprivation of constitutional rights is afforded a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2035.879" offset="8246836">And so the question as to second petition as we see it must remain flexible much as the lower courts sometimes strive for fixed rules and much as I'm sure, we in the Government side, would like to have them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.344" offset="8324786">Congress found itself unable to formulate them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.087" offset="8343698">And I doubt at least we're not prepared to offer in a very specific way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.929" offset="8371075">All we say about the second petition is that the fact that it is a second one is irrelevant fact to be considered like everything else in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.806" offset="8418617">It's part of the files and records of the case that this is a second petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.357" offset="8440769">And the way to be given to it must necessarily depend on the particular facts of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.018" offset="8471489">I think this explains some of the confusion that my opponent has talked to in the Court of Appeals and the decisions are confusing, they're not even consistent within a circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.759" offset="8526451">But in the case of Smith against the United States which he mentioned in the District of Columbia Circuit, it was then in a second petition some substantial basis for the allegation of the prisoner, so reasonably that it was possible, that the prisoner at the time he had not -- at the time he made his plea had not really been mentally competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.059" offset="8635643">And on that basis, although the court en banc split for its reasons, there was almost agreement that the petition should be heard because there was something that really pulled into question the fundamental fairness of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.886" offset="8698964">And so we think that largely, this has to be decided on a case to case basis on the -- in relation to files and records of particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.557" offset="8737625">Let's see what the record shows here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.620" offset="8745880">As of this second petition in which about a year and nine months after he pleaded guilty, this prisoner said he didn't know what he was doing because he was under the influence of narcotics at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.999" offset="8807320">Well, first thing the record shows was that the prisoner was arraigned on Friday, January the 16th on a very same -- given a preliminary hearing I should say, on Friday the -- January 16th, the same day as the robbery, bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.361" offset="8880776">That afternoon -- and that afternoon, he indicated to the United States Attorneys that he was ready to proceed by a waiver of indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.244" offset="8924348">The only reasonable inference from that record is that he was caught in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.002" offset="8959352">Any case on Monday, January the 19th, he came before the district judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.841" offset="8994774">And if you read the record at pages 1 to 5, I think the judge was this here for as you can expect the judge today in trying to make sure that the defendant knew what he was doing and knew what his rights were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.614" offset="9061857">He started out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.583" offset="9069693">Now, this is a typical defendant had no lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.356" offset="9084844">The judge made absolutely certain to understand to have a right to have a lawyer that if you don't have enough money, I'll appoint a lawyer for you and then he said, he made the defendant say, “You understand, you have that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.706" offset="9162167">You're waiving that right here in open court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.661" offset="9185991">And he went on and said “In addition, Mr. Sander, that's at the bottom of page 2.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.248" offset="9208351">You have a right to have your case heard by the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.338" offset="9228727">And you -- if you have any idea that you are innocent, you should have the case heard before the grand jury, because I can accept only a guilty plea from you if you think you are not guilty of this charge, you should have the matter heard by the grand jury to determine whether or not you should even be brought to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.737" offset="9314304">And he said to the defendant, “You want to have the case heard by the grand jury”, and then the defendant said, “No, I waived.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.581" offset="9341680">The judge didn't hear him and he said, “What was that?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.519" offset="9353488">And the defendant repeated, “No, I waived.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.079" offset="9367698">And the judge went on again and said, “Has anybody made any promises to you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.709" offset="9386193">And the defendant said, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.132" offset="9391940">He said, “Does anybody made any threats?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.876" offset="9398836">And he said, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.674" offset="9406046">And then only after all this had been gone through, did the judge accept a guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.317" offset="9440632">Now, I don't know how long this took when you read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.932" offset="9455052">But when a judge is that careful, when the defendant is continually giving the right answers, he went over to have to sign the waiver of information, it's hard to believe that a judge who was as very careful as this judge was whether he accepted a guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.225" offset="9532270">We have at the slightest reason to doubt, the defendant knew what he was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.299" offset="9560586">After the plea was accepted, judge did not sentence the defendant immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.656" offset="9582007">He asked for probation of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.315" offset="9592665">And let me say now that I think this is a fact that has been somewhat neglected in relation to this question of whether to hold a hearing or not, probably because the probation reports are not sent up as part of the records in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.418" offset="9661001">But in a probation situation particularly with the plea of guilty, where it's taken as in this case three weeks to get up a probation report before the defendant is brought back for sentencing, where the defendant has interviewed other people who know and are interviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.654" offset="9750026">If there are issues which tend to pass out on the voluntariness of the plea or on the ability of a defendant to enter a plea, they are likely to show up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.886" offset="9802898">And there have been occasions where judges have said, “I don't think I will accept this plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.994" offset="9831320">I think there is a question of innocence and done it.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.309" offset="9928600">What I am saying is that where a judge has before him a probation report which would raise a question of mental competence for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.521" offset="10001429">A probation report would tend to reflect that not necessarily.</text>

            <text syncTime="2479.905" offset="10022954">I'm saying it's another factor in the record, because if a probation report for example which show a long history of mental incompetence, it would be the duty of a judge, I think to say, no matter what this man says about vacate -- about waiving counsel, I don't -- I am not certain that he has a mental capacity probation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2516.170" offset="10168090">The -- and I think the record indicates at least something about what was in the probation report on page -- on the sentencing procedure which is on page 7 of the record, you see the probation officer was present and the judge asked the probation officer, if he had anything to add to his report and I say his attorney was present, they had nothing to report and then the petitioner was asked if he has anything to say and then he said, I have been using narcotics off and on for quite a while.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.360" offset="10340812">I would like to go to Springfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.384" offset="10352933">Now, this is what the probation officer present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.627" offset="10361919">The judge accepts this and says, “I think that he ought to be given this consideration and before I sentence him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.431" offset="10401102">I think it is evident from that and that the Solicitor General has stated the Court have said that the fact that petitioner was a narcotic user off and on was reflected in the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.526" offset="10453452">Now, in the same from that, when you have a judge who is, as I think clearly, interested in seeing that the defendant knows his rights, is aware of them, is making any waiver he wants to make voluntarily, a judge would not go ahead and sentence the report, it seems to us, unless he had no reason to believe that this was not done voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.694" offset="10586154">In other words, unless he was convinced that it was a voluntary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.504" offset="10605380">And so on the face of this record, if you consider both petitioner's responses, the fact that he was before the judge then, the fact that the fact of narcotics addiction was in the record and then let me also say that the decision and testimony of experts is that the mere fact that one have taken narcotics normally does not affect one's mental facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.348" offset="10720737">This is recorded in the decision in the Juelich case, the testimony of the experts on the Lipscomb case in 209 F2d. at 831, and the same thing is testified to by a -- expert from public health service in the Cox case which it doesn't show up in the opinion but it's in the record that was before this Court and this is generally reflected in the jury, that it takes either an extraordinary dose of narcotics or the pains of withdrawal symptoms are the two things that tend to affect ability so that we have that record at the sentence procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.461" offset="10913207">Then the next thing that we have in the record is the petition filed a year later in which it has been characterized as the shotgun approach, in which he stated that his plea of guilty was involuntary because it was entered without handful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.970" offset="11007248">Well, it's true this is an indigent petitioner and one can call denied the tooth of pleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.186" offset="11044133">But our statement about the relevancy of the first petition, our position with respect to that is that once a prisoner know that he has a remedy for a plea of guilty that was obtained wrongly, feeling that he'd been overreached that he'd been had in applying the phrase, once he knows that if there's any real basis in that or such an attitude, the real facts are going to be alleged inarticulately, not very artistically but if a man says they promised me something I didn't get it, he can say that if it's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.742" offset="11282369">It's when he's trying to fit his case to the facts of other cases which you get allegations that may well be is absolutely contradicted by the record as this one was, this first petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.068" offset="11375679">So that our position roughly is this about the second petition that we are not saying that the mere fact that one was filed was conclusive, if it were true as petitioner alleges that the first one was dismissed merely because it was generalized and that this was a mere -- this was a particularization of the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.203" offset="11496155">We wouldn't be arguing if the first was entitled to any waiver at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.660" offset="11514023">But that isn't the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.748" offset="11522382">In the first place, the second one wasn't filed to about nine months later from a different prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.529" offset="11557491">In the second place, the second petition is in the sense, inconsistent with the first because the first says, “I knew what I was doing but I was coerced.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.778" offset="11602526">The second one says, “I didn't know what I was doing at all.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.910" offset="11623006">Now, when you have, we say, the combination of factors that you have here, a district judge is justified looking at the whole record before him including the fact that it was the second petition in denying the second motion on the grounds that there is nothing in the record before him which passed enough doubt on the voluntariness of the petition to justify a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3242.670" offset="13074056">He says, the Court shall not be required to entertain a motion unless it offers new grounds not determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.978" offset="13107284">Now, that's almost -- that's not much clear as in 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.945" offset="13127137">What the legislative history shows is that the judicial conference, when they were considering this motion, decided that they would wanted to have the petitioner assert every grounds that they have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.751" offset="13186382">But -- and so originally, it was raised that the Court should not be allowed to consider something unless it raised new grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.380" offset="13224939">There were various judges who objected to that saying it's never too late to do justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.272" offset="13244479">And so it ended up legislative history showing that the judge could consider it but did not have to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.231" offset="13280319">And I think this is what -- I think that -- I think as I said in the beginning that if one tries to make rules too rigidly, that you will end up not protecting the one group that this is really designed to reach, which is that rare person who has really been overreached.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.329" offset="13380733">This is rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.334" offset="13392750">We have also at the state courts that have been built in to avoid this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.364" offset="13412812">But if it could well be that the one person who should have a hearing may not make his allegations the first time he's heard about it, I think that we have to judge this in the light of experience and common sense and reality.</text>

            <text syncTime="3538.978" offset="14259284">And I think it's happening, I suppose I have read more of these petitions than almost any person in the Government, and it gets to a point where it gets very difficult to assort the real -- the ones that really troubled you from the ones that sounds troublesome and then turn out not to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.592" offset="14357713">And if we have many experiences that the courts have been having lately with this allegation of the use of narcotics, I think the danger is that when we get the special, the odd, a very extraordinary case and it is the extraordinary case in our federal system where we ought to have a remedy there is always the danger if we have too many hearings, the one person that ought to be believe won't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.476" offset="14477249">And I ask the Court to consider one happened in the case of Catalano in the Second Circuit, where the Court said this in its decision in 292 F.2d has said this may be incredible allegation as to a man who claims to be under narcotics for two and a half weeks at his trial, no -- not noticed by the Court and not noticed by his lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.236" offset="14572335">He made very specific allegations, the Court said, “Let us be careful, we must have a hearing just to settle this down.”</text>
