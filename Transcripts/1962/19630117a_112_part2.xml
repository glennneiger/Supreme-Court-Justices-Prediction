            <text syncTime="18.505" offset="177403">I would like to make one or two full remarks with regard to one or two questions or rather one of two matters that Mr. Murphy touched on.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.875" offset="218885">That has referenced to the evolution of the county unit method of nominations insofar as in 1917, it was enacted into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.132" offset="263920">I think Mr. Murphy made it clear that the -- the basis for that enactment into law was the fact that at that time, under the party rule, there was no provision for a run over primary in the event that one candidate for Governor or Senate failed to receive a majority of the unit vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.366" offset="340825">And it was this convention juggling and convention nomination that led to the incorporation of the county unit method into law.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.005" offset="379382">It was not as an unfounded statement, we say in the appellee's brief would have that it was tied in with any scheme to disfranchise Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.618" offset="425880">It was instilled and stirred or inspired solely as we see it from the desire of the people to prevent convention nomination.</text>

            <text syncTime="120.443" offset="585122">That is correct sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.946" offset="595153">At the outset, I would like to state this that we think, do not contend otherwise that Baker versus Carr has settled all questions of justiciability, standing to sue in jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.270" offset="644472">We make no issue of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.286" offset="652518">At the same time, we do say this, that there is still remains an area, under the Fourteenth Amendment in which the State is accorded a wide latitude of discretion and with respect to which no court should undertake to substitute its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.044" offset="735587">To that extent, there are still areas that are non-justiciable once you get past the initial question.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.612" offset="785847">Before getting into the merits of what we think are the applicable Fourteenth Amendment standards in this case, I would like to discuss briefly one question which the appellee raises, which if he is correct of course would dispose of this case and that is that there is -- that it's unconstitutional to have any weighting at all in an electoral system.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.063" offset="879574">The appellee says that representation is a shared right and consequently some weighting, some inequality is necessary due to interim shifts in population and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.391" offset="940910">On other hand, he says that voting is not a shared right, and therefore, there can be no weighting.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.624" offset="969853">We think that this cannot withstand analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.412" offset="988975">The Governor and other executive department officers represent the citizen in the execution of the laws, just as represented -- represent the people in the making of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.752" offset="1034428">And, neither the legislative apportionment case or in the case of the judiciary and we elect our judges in Georgia or in the case of the executive, the voter votes individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.817" offset="1094614">No one else participates or shares in the casting of that vote and that's true in the legislative case.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.708" offset="1122200">Now, what happens after his vote is cast and after it has been tabulated, the influence of the effect that is given to that vote is necessarily weighted because he obviously cannot exist in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.783" offset="1178520">There are other people to be considered whose votes also have some influence in a way.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Freeman Leverett</label>
            <text syncTime="310.363" offset="1344867">Now, as to a legislative representative, the total legislative power is shared by the allocation of one or more members of a multi-unit body or collegiate body by the allocating of one of more of those numbers to particular areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.658" offset="1421981">And under the electoral arrangement involving the executive of the judiciary, you don't have a number of people to be shared by allocating one out to each.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.855" offset="1462836">You only have one individual, the Governor or the particular judge or the other State House office and the sharing necessarily has to take effect in a different manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.254" offset="1508394">So, in that case, as in the case of the election of the President, under the electoral college which the sharing is done by the allocation of units rather than by the allocation of individual representatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="544.521" offset="2281409">They said this, it relied upon MacDougall versus Green, they said, “We do not strike the county unit system as such.</text>

            <text syncTime="567.155" offset="2372002">They referred to it and say that there probably are some differences, but they end up saying that we don't have to decide that here and then they go all up on (Inaudible) involving burden of proof and end up postulating two standards that they say should apply in these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.619" offset="2517870">We say that that is exactly what this is because the county unit system, as devised, with regard to units, its simply a substitution for this collegiate body that, theretofore had done the electing and that is the convention, to nominate not to elect.</text>

            <text syncTime="717.923" offset="2975013">The -- this question might be restated thusly, would a unit system be valid even assuming equality of population within each of the participating units?</text>
            <text syncTime="730.379" offset="3024854">The court below as well as the court in the Turman case and the South case have said or resolved this question in the affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.062" offset="3059649">The appellees though says no.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.583" offset="3069680">He (Inaudible) -- or relies upon the Mosley case, United States versus Mosley in which the Court held that there was a federal right to have one's vote counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.604" offset="3109804">The appellee says that since in a unit system, the candidate or rather the votes of the unit are cast as a unit that the votes of the people within the unit who voted for the minority candidate are not counted, and therefore, it brings it within the pale of Mosley versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.998" offset="3187336">As far as the Mosley case is concerned, we think it's sufficient to distinguish by the fact that it was a criminal case where there has been fraudulent and covert acts that were contrary not only to federal law but to state law, that some votes have just not -- it's been simply -- people tabulating them had refused to count them.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.151" offset="3259956">And that being a criminal case, we think has no relevancy to this situation where this is legal under State law and there was nothing covert about what is done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.257" offset="3300394">And we say that the idea of casting votes by unit is Constitution that it gives recognition to the organization of the State on a county basis and that has been true as illustrated by the history in this case of the county unit system from the very earliest.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.973" offset="3375313">Georgia has accorded a high degree of autonomy to its counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.470" offset="3397256">They voted as a unit in electing the Governor in the -- at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.655" offset="3417945">As the Court in the case here said below, counties were governmental units in Georgia before the union and had their voice in the councils of government on the State level through representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.313" offset="3460577">In the South case, a judge simply said this, the history of the State and of the political parties within it shows that political power has from the beginning been exerted to a large extent through counties as voting units on similar unit lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.740" offset="3518360">Similar recognition has been given to the identity of interest in a county that brings about the rationality of treating them as a unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.233" offset="3568306">In several, the recent reapportionment cases, the Tawes case from Maryland, the Simon case from New York, Baker versus Carr itself upon remand, and the Scholle case in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.613" offset="3617834">Under Georgia law, our counties have always enjoyed a high degree of autonomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.951" offset="3639150">They have it within their power to levy taxes or not levy taxes, to afford certain vital services or not to afford.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.755" offset="3670392">They elect their own officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.282" offset="3676453">They have their own system of courts and public records.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.977" offset="3691290">County government is managed by a wide variety of boards of county commissioners, ordinances and county managers.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.347" offset="3720756">The Georgia Constitution expressed the exempts of county government from -- to uniform its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.625" offset="3745834">Lastly, each county has its own school system, determines amount of taxes that it will levy within the certain limits and the extent of enrichment programs that it will impose upon its educational system.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.303" offset="3792541">And is -- in this context, the unit aspects of this case of course apply equally to all counties, regardless of the population.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.239" offset="3832351">That brings me to the Fourteenth Amendment standards that we think are applicable to cases of this nature and similar to cases involving apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.924" offset="3875088">We think that these standards are inferable from a composite of the majority concurring and dissenting opinion in Baker versus Carr, regardless of the divergences in that opinion with respect to the procedural questions of jurisdictions, justiciability, standards and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.267" offset="3952410">In the majority of opinion, it was stated, “Judicial standards under the Equal Protection Clause are well developed and familiar and it has been open to courts since the enactment of the Fourteenth Amendment to determine, if on the particular facts they must that a discrimination reflects no policy, but simply arbitrary and capricious action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="984.550" offset="4041540">In one of the special concurring opinions, this statement was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.515" offset="4057422">Universal equality is not the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.949" offset="4067140">There's room for weighting.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.753" offset="4074350">The prohibition of the Equal Protection Clause goes no further than the invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.332" offset="4096711">And another concurrence where emphasis was placed upon the fact of horizontal as well as vertical discrimination, the blending of those two which brought about a situation, where it was impossible to determine if there was a basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.610" offset="4157837">Another concurrence was careful to give assurances that State legislatures need not be “so structured” as to reflect with approximate equality, the voice of every voter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.270" offset="4200469">Nor does the Constitution prevent the states acting not irrationally from choosing any electoral, legislative structure it thinks best suited to the interest, temper and customs of its people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.364" offset="4244877">Mr. Justice Frankfurter's dissenting opinion, he very strongly says in a language that I could hardly improve that the idea of equality of voting power is not implicit in the history of American institutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.041" offset="4531493">We think that several propositions necessarily follow is corollary to this or from what has been said in these cases, in the various opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.745" offset="4582379">First, that the Fourteenth Amendment does not limit a state's choice and allocate its electoral power to a single basis, equal population representation, either in the case of legislative representation or in the case of the allocation of electoral strength as the statewide offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.632" offset="4673912">And particularly is that so, in this situation where this is simply the primary and you do have a general election where people are capable of expressing themselves with numerical equality and that has been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.132" offset="4723858">We had a run-off election in Georgia for Lieutenant Governor and a dissent arose as to the candidates who would participate in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.934" offset="4759071">And another candidate who is following them was limited mostly to one of the big cities came within 2000 or 3000 votes of getting enough signatures to get on the nominating petition in a little less than two weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.997" offset="4823333">We have traced in our brief the history of legislative assemblies and demonstrated that when the founding fathers came to draft the Constitution, they were divided into two factions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.412" offset="4873070">One, the French school of thought which inspired by the writings of Rousseau were referred to as the egalitarian democrats, the egalitarians, one man, one vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.391" offset="4924897">On the other hand, in a raid against them was the British school of thought which saw the necessity for imposing limitations upon majority will at its very source, a proposition that had been suggested as early as Aristotle's political, the history of the convention records that the resulting product was more English than French.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.615" offset="5025834">In fact, the -- one of the affidavits of the appellee that is in the record concedes this fact that the English school of thought predominated in the nominating or rather in the constitutional conventions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.082" offset="5079751">It's been shown too I think that while Thomas Jefferson has generally recorded as being on the side of equalitarian democracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.428" offset="5109112">He was basically an agrarian democrat and it just happened that equalitarianism fit in quite fine with his conception of a grand -- agrarian democracy as the people started moving out of the tidewater areas out into the western portions of the country and tilling the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.563" offset="5189674">But we don't have to go to the records of the constitutional convention to determine what the nature of this government is that was founded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.353" offset="5224782">We think the plain words of the Constitution itself are highly ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.835" offset="5242755">To begin with, a national legislature was provided for, in one House of which each State has equality of representation regardless of the number of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.541" offset="5285491">And even in the other branch which as George Mason said was to be the grand depository of the democratic principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.747" offset="5314330">Equality is not achieved there either because of the fact that -- of the requirement that each State had at least one representative regardless of the number of people.</text>

            <text syncTime="1536.462" offset="6249200">The last point I think that we might say that disputes the fact of complete equality and expression of majority will is the example of this Court itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.110" offset="6295803">The founding fathers created this Court composed of nine men, no one of which has ever been voted on by anybody, but yet gave you the power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1570.828" offset="6386709">This opinion in Baker versus Carr, Mr. Justice Frankfurter reviewed the apportionments existing in legislatures and common law and the English procedure and the colonies and the States at the time of adoption, the States at the time of the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment and today, and concluded that, as he stated, “These figures show more than individual variations from a generally accepted standard of electoral equality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.731" offset="6502275">They show that there is not as there has never been a standard by which the place of equality as effect an apportionment can be measured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.021" offset="6539473">We think that that brings up another of subordinate propositions up to the general proposition that equal protect -- equal population is not the only basis of electoral apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.396" offset="6592972">And that is that courts should not become involved in drawing mathematical formulas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.205" offset="6616168">That is not the type of thing that is generally thought to be a judicial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.017" offset="6639470">To begin with, first, judicially insoluble question that you have is what method of mathematical evaluation are you going to use, aside from the actual fixing of the limits and the formula itself?</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.478" offset="6697253">Would it be the theoretical minimum of persons unable to -- capable of electing a majority of both Houses or one House and what about a unicameral legislature and I think you have a case in Nebraska, I do not know whether it is coming up here or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="1671.878" offset="6790875">The more difficult problem then remains of fixing the limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.848" offset="6806758">Should it be 16.5%, the theoretical minimum of persons who are capable of electing a majority in the United States Senate, or should it be 43.3%, the number of persons residing in 39 States who could cast a majority of the electoral votes for President.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.384" offset="6872900">Now, the three-judge court in the Georgia legislative apportionment case held that a theoretical minimum of 22% for both Houses was invidiously discriminatory and that one house at least had to be proportionate to population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.141" offset="6927966">Upon remand in the Baker case, the District Court invalidated minimums of 26.9 for the Senate and 28.7 for the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.948" offset="6963179">In New York on the other hand, theoretical minimums of 36.9% for the Senate and 38.2% for the House were up held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.327" offset="7000691">The Idaho Court in Caesar versus Williams upheld a minimum of 32.7 which by the way is substantially the theoretical minimum under the 1962 revised county unit law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.983" offset="7071326">Colorado minimums of 29.8 for the House and 32.1 for the Senate were held invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.272" offset="7096508">But in none of these cases, as any court undertake it to say just where this line can be drawn and the reading of the opinions leaves you completely helpless in trying to discern from there any ascertainable standard or formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.559" offset="7157635">Or, there's another method that you could use and evaluate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.648" offset="7173935">That's the mathematical ratio, the comparison of one political entity to another that can be compared to either the most disproportionate or the least populous unit or it can be compared to an average unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.151" offset="7236002">And applied to the Georgia County unit system, it results that the ratio of Fulton County, the State's largest county, the Echols County, the smallest county is 14.8 to 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.598" offset="7273723">On the other hand, it is the court below held that the comparison should be from the particular county to the average county of their ratio would be approximately 1.93 to 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.509" offset="7333386">Baker versus Carr, the courts validated an apportionment which gave ratios to largest to the smallest of 7 to 1 for the Senate, 23 to 1 for the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.011" offset="7375391">There were some variations in Alabama that got involved there on the problem of the fact that one House could not be completely proportionate to population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.507" offset="7413426">Under the Electoral College, the ratio of New York to Alaska runs 8 to 1 as to eligible voters and 5 to 1 with regard to population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.318" offset="7448639">The ratio of the average Congressional District to Alaska which is one Congressional District is approximately 2 to 1 not 5 to 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.147" offset="7483956">When compared with Senate representation, the ratio of Alaska to New York is 74 to 1 as to population and a 131 as to eligible voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.942" offset="7523140">Now, there's a third statistical approach and that is suggested by the American Society of Political -- the American Political Science Society and that is comparing the percentage departure from the median or from the average district or unit as involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.019" offset="7591476">The Science Association recommends a maximum departure of 15% for Congressional districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.883" offset="7618853">Representative Celler has recommended 20% in some legislation he has proposed and Senator Clark who apparently was inspired by Mr. Anthony Lewis' article in the Harvard Law Review has proposed a 50% maximum deviation from the average district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.076" offset="7679666">Now this is simply a preview, a prelude of things to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.945" offset="7695130">If this Court or any other court gets itself in the position or trying to evaluate, to set formulas, to draw lines that is not the solid stuff that is traditional to the judicial system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.528" offset="7745494">They are no judiciable manageable standards by which you can evaluate such a situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2704.932" offset="10923133">Now, the problem arises through the necessity of giving a minority some voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.497" offset="10949360">To give a minority some voice in the field of representation, you have got to have some classifications, districting is classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.827" offset="10994709">If the drawing of a line in saying this man is in this district, this man is another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.220" offset="11016234">That at least is classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.717" offset="11026265">The only other way you can give a minority of voice and representation is either to have a proportional system of representation or to ignore the minority's voice by elections at large.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.890" offset="11082898">Therefore, using our system which is not a proportional system, the American system hasn't developed that way, if you are going to give a minority a voice, a voice, not control, you must have some classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.375" offset="11144861">Now, in the field of voting, no classification is necessary because one man's vote is his fair voice and no classification is necessary and nor is any classification usual at least in American history and in any of the State practices with the possible exception of the three that have been described here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.625" offset="11245902">The truth is that in franchise exercise, the majority or the plurality control generally under our law, but through a unit system and the only purpose of it could be is to see that a minority prevails because one or the other must.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.665" offset="11326046">If you try the classification of voters, qualified voters, that to the State is to aside who is a qualified voter, in order to give one man a greater vote there is an opposite side of this coin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.592" offset="11381739">You have had to give somebody else a lesser vote, so obvious the classification in the field of voting must in necessity involve discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3078.679" offset="12418069">Second, I'm going to mention very briefly the point alluded to by Mr. Justice White, that is the constitutional protection of this primary, but I'm going to deal at little length on the question of whether or not this primary effectively controls the election of the United State Senator because I think the Seventeenth Amendment question could be in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.583" offset="12497690">And then I'm going to try to measure the county unit statute against the Fourteenth Amendment in practice and principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.258" offset="12520364">And then I'm going to briefly discuss the Seventeenth Amendment question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.646" offset="12537919">Now to begin with, I think Mr. Justice White was correct when he asked the question or if there was an implication in the question, what would be the effect of Georgia saying that a man in Echols County shall have seven-and-a-half ballots, a man in Clayton, one ballot, DeKalb, three-fifths of a ballot, a man in Fulton half a ballot, a man just one county removed, three-and-a-half ballots, a man over a county line, one-and-a-fifth ballots.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.400" offset="12645021">For no matter how you look at the unit system this is precisely its effect and that's what it's designed to achieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.857" offset="12674800">The system is further more compounded in its effect by the fact that a man does not have to get the majority of the votes of the county in order to carry the full county units straight to the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.086" offset="12719731">In a five-man race, a man may get 30% of the votes of a county and carry the full unit vote of the county thus reversing the vote for those who voted against him who were in the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.360" offset="12764766">It is for this reason that the system contrived to produce some rather absurd results.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.709" offset="12786186">For example in 1954, the Governor of Georgia was overwhelmingly elected by unit votes though he only received 36% of the popular votes and 72% of the people had in fact voted for somebody else.</text>

            <text syncTime="3337.171" offset="13452100">Now the system as it was devised is a bracket system. From zero to 15,000 population, you get two units, then you get another unit for additional 4999 people, then a unit for 9999, then a unit for 14,999, then a unit for 14,999 and then two units for 29,999.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.515" offset="13577383">Now, it's rather curious, 30,000 people at the bottom of the scale get four units, 30,000 additional people at the top of the scale get two units.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.321" offset="13628688">29,999 people at the bottom of the scale get four units, but 29,998 people at the top of the scale get no units.</text>

            <text syncTime="3396.365" offset="13688874">I might point out -- I'm going to argue that no unit system is permissible because the -- of course the decision below was standard, the Court adapted that principle which I think is the correct principle in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.495" offset="13733386">But in 1970, 50.5% of the people had forty-four and eight-tenths percent of units.</text>

            <text syncTime="3456.512" offset="13929409">There was, as Mayor Hartsfield has pointed out, a tremendous lack of interest in elections growing out of this state of affairs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3531.290" offset="14228564">But I think it's only fair to say that I don't want to say anything more about it except the record shows that where the county unit power gave to the inbuilt political apparatus, the greatest advantage there, you had real Negro disfranchisement and in certain counties with large Negro populations, with high unit values, no votes at all from Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.004" offset="14315395">On the other hand, in the urban counties where the Negroes were voting and of reasonable proportion of their population, their votes didn't count.</text>

            <text syncTime="3597.223" offset="14492296">I don't think it would have been possible that there would have been any change in this had it not been for Baker versus Carr and the intervention of the federal court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.845" offset="14530748">And I might quote Mr. Madison on this principle who says in the debate on Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution, the right of the Congress to control the time, place and manner of elections, he said this.</text>

            <text syncTime="4544.826" offset="18282663">Irrational may also mean that it may have a pattern, but seeks to achieve some kind of an impermissible state policy which is another way of saying that the discrimination is directed in hostility towards certain groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="4560.590" offset="18345775">Now, the Georgia system has a discriminatory object and a capricious impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4570.227" offset="18384332">There is no pattern that you can discern in this system except that the larger the population, the less the vote of each voter shall be counted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4580.141" offset="18423933">But, the system also can be viewed as discriminating as amongst counties in roughly the same population groupings, and in roughly the same geographical areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4592.989" offset="18475342">On page 22 of our brief, we point out some mountain counties.</text>

            <text syncTime="4621.122" offset="18587878">Then, you can go down in the Southwest section of the State, the old plantation belt and you will find discrimination ratios as great amongst those counties sirs as 1 to 1200 to 1 to 6500.</text>
            <text syncTime="4634.358" offset="18640854">Then you can take the counties, this one is just on a random, that Board of the State on Florida and the discriminations ratios run from 1 unit assigned to 938 votes to 1 unit assigned for 8211 votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4649.194" offset="18700100">You can take it within Congressional districts and you will find counties adjoining each other in a Congressional district which has some maybe historical grouping.</text>

            <text syncTime="4892.746" offset="19674363">This is a case -- leaving aside the racial elements, this case in which as state had deliberately given people on a basis not on their education, not on any basis if they are willing to stand up and tell us a half a vote or seven-and-a-half votes and that feels discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.221" offset="19744266">I must admit that there is a presumptive validity to state legislative acts, but once you have demonstrated the kind of discrimination implicit in this case in which a majority -- I'm sorry, in which a man maybe or in which a -- 50% of the people have only 31% of the units and in which it is mathematically possible to find a Governor elected by 50.5% of the votes in a two-man race and 6.1% of the votes in a five-man race.</text>

            <text syncTime="5330.336" offset="21424671">The language of the Seventeenth Amendment on this point is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5335.878" offset="21446928">The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State elected by the people thereof and it doesn't stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5345.696" offset="21486111">It was very careful to decide and to determine who those people shall be, it said this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.198" offset="21508159">The electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5361.036" offset="21547551">It said, the State can determine who these electors shall be and Georgia has.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.239" offset="21568345">Georgia has said it in these words of its Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="5370.380" offset="21584854">Every citizen of this state who is a citizen of United States, 18 years or upwards not laboring under any disabilities named in this article and possessing the qualifications provided by it shall be a qualified voter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5384.440" offset="21641174">So Georgia has now decided who the elector shall be under the Seventeenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5390.524" offset="21665520">Now, having decided who the elector shall be, the state legislature has determined that these electors shall not elect the United States Senator from Georgia.</text>

            <text syncTime="5412.888" offset="21754964">There is no way to change a unit into a person and if the legislative history of the Seventeenth Amendment demonstrates a desire to get rid of the indirect election of Senators, this system of course grabs an indirect election upon us.</text>

            <text syncTime="5979.097" offset="24019780">I would first like to state the interest of the United States in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5983.578" offset="24037648">Declaration of independent states a principle which is basic to our American way of life, namely that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="5993.456" offset="24077145">In periodic elections here in the United States, we select our leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5997.048" offset="24091564">If we become dissatisfied, we select new leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5999.914" offset="24103058">So therefore, the free and unencumbered exercise with a franchise is basic to American system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6006.701" offset="24130226">We believe that this free and unencumbered exercise with the franchise is under serious challenge in an arbitrary, capricious and discriminatory fashion in the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="6017.949" offset="24175156">But we believe that this evil is not confined to the State of Georgia as the Court heard in the Tennessee cases last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="6025.490" offset="24205354">Districts have been so arranged in certain areas of the United States that an individual in one area has 10, 15, 50 or 100 times the vote strength of an individual in another area.</text>
            <text syncTime="6038.585" offset="24257703">The United States Government has a responsibility to do all in its power to ensure that those who have been disfranchised in whole or in part that that right is restored to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6050.983" offset="24307336">That in this effort to also restore some confidence in representative government where this kind of practices exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="6058.821" offset="24338683">In Baker versus Carr, this Court has determined that the weighing or dilution of votes through malapportionment was justiciable in the federal courts under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6071.718" offset="24390196">This is the first case in which the Court has been asked to pass upon the major substantive constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6079.135" offset="24419871">Therefore, the principles enunciated in this case will have an effect on millions of Americans who have been deprived in whole or in part of their franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="6089.457" offset="24461249">The issues involved in this case really are relatively simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="6093.360" offset="24476818">First, as far as the facts are concerned, there has been a gross and arbitrary discrimination against the voters who live in the urban areas in favor of those who live in rural areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="6106.349" offset="24528750">And number two that that gross discrimination is in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="6116.136" offset="24567933">Beyond that, we don't feel that it is necessary for the Court to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="6119.122" offset="24579845">We don't think it's necessary for the Court to accept some hypothetical variant to this system which the Georgia legislature may pass in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="6127.362" offset="24612864">We don't think that the Court should limit its future actions in this field by accepting a standards -- standard which may or may not be applicable to other states under other circumstances in other parts of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="6143.898" offset="24679006">In this case, Mr. Chief Justice, the discrimination is gross, but before I get into a discussion of that, I would like to discuss just briefly about what we feel the scope of this case is in view with some of the questions that has been raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="7436.163" offset="29848012">I don't think the analogy is correct because there is a far difference, a great difference between the states who gave up their sovereignty and there were concessions made.</text>
            <text syncTime="7448.891" offset="29898898">When they gave up their sovereignty to create the United States, one of the concessions that was made to them was the fact that they would have the equivalent vote in the electoral college, equivalent to the number of Senators had -- they had plus the numbers of Representatives they had.</text>

            <text syncTime="7482.538" offset="30033481">There wasn't any question about believing in democracy but the struggle at that time was between the large states and the small states.</text>

            <text syncTime="7497.161" offset="30091995">The idea that there was this English-French system, that really wasn't taken up, I don't think it's borne out by a study of the debate of the constitutional convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="7507.418" offset="30133060">The English-French system and the merits of them were taken up after the constitutional convention rather the -- it might be that there's some confusion about Mr. Harrington, Mr. Harrington, who was a quoted, lived in the 18th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="7524.012" offset="30199411">And I believe that quotes come from Mr. Parrington's book who was a -- wrote about the American Scene in the 20th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="7532.396" offset="30232952">So, some of the confusion might arise out of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7534.877" offset="30242879">There is also contended that we don't really have enough cases for the Court to pass on.</text>
            <text syncTime="7543.093" offset="30275793">That there is -- there hasn't been enough litigation in connection with this matter for the Court to make any decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="7550.560" offset="30305573">I don't think that that bears up in -- when the Constitution was written, we didn't have decisions on due process or commerce between the states or freedom of speech, but we made important progress in all of these fields under the general umbrella of the Constitution and under the guidance of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7570.587" offset="30385716">When George Washington was President, you didn't have railroads, you didn't have automobiles let alone jet aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="7577.001" offset="30411421">But the great miracle of the Constitution is that we've been able to deal with the problems of the 20th Century as well as the problems of the 18th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="7584.680" offset="30442141">These are the great problems that are facing the United States at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="7588.281" offset="30456456">And this kind of invidious practice that exists now and has existed before and the Georgia County Unit System is a -- strikes at the very heart of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="7599.044" offset="30499506">If we can give equal protection to those who feel that they've been deprived of their economic rights, certainly we can give equal protection to those who have been deprived of the most basic right of all which is the right to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="7611.214" offset="30548198">If we cannot protect them, then the whole fabric of American the system, then our way of life is irreparably damaged.</text>
