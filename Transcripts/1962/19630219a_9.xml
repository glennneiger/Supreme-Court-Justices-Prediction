            <label>Ms. Jewel Lafontant</label>
            <text syncTime="14.210" offset="160162">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.225" offset="172283">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.757" offset="194435">The petitioner herein was tried and convicted for the unlawful sale and possession of narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.404" offset="224946">And her convictions affirmed by the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.142" offset="243963">She sought certiorari on the ground that the confession obtained from her by threats and promises was used against her in her trial in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.073" offset="315643">This Court granted certiorari upon receipt from the Illinois Supreme Court of a certificate that decision of the federal claim refer to in the order of the United States Supreme Court was necessary, was necessary to the judgment rendered by the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.409" offset="413027">The people's testimony reveals that on January 17th, 1959, an informer, one Zeno, who had been previously convicted of the unlawful sale of narcotics, was again in the custody of Illinois officials for again violating the narcotic laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.376" offset="512920">He agreed with his arresting officers upon promises of leniency by the said officers to set up an undisclosed third party for the crime of the sale of narcotics, wanting to keep from going to the penitentiary if he possibly could, as will appear on page 21 of the record, this informer took the arresting police officers Bryson's, Sims and Kobar to the apartment building where petitioner resided.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.291" offset="636531">Alone, he gained admittance to the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.107" offset="655757">Inside that apartment, there were three people present, namely the petitioner, the informer Zeno, and a visitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.513" offset="689403">Zeno was out of the presence or sight of the police officers from 10 to 15 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.701" offset="718137">He later emerged from the doorway leading to the apartment, rejoined the arresting officers and handed them a package which contained marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.773" offset="762441">He told them that the petitioner had given it to him, had sold it to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.661" offset="786056">It is uncontroverted that the arresting officers were not present at the time of the alleged sale, and that they relied upon the word of Zeno that the petitioner sold the narcotics to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.472" offset="837256">Followed by the police officers, Zeno returned to the petitioner's apartment and then she opened the door, she was arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.203" offset="880201">She was grabbed by both her hands and she was told by Officer Sims that she had unlawfully sold narcotics to Zeno.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.649" offset="929938">She was then taken back into her apartment, to the bedroom, if you please, flanked by two police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.220" offset="960240">In her own behalf, she protested for innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.928" offset="979048">Now, while in that bedroom, Officer Sims had adroitly inquired whether petitioner had any children, noticing ad bringing up the fact that there was children's clothing in the bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.767" offset="1042474">He also inquired quite adroitly about her subsistence.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.909" offset="1063058">And he found out that she had two little children ages 3 and 4 that she was receiving state funds in order to help support those children, state funds from what is called Aid to Dependent Children in Illinois or ADC.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.499" offset="1125334">And then he said at page 35 of the record, “If we take you into the station and charge you with the offense, the ADC would be probably be cut off and you will probably lose custody of your children.”</text>
            <text syncTime="271.134" offset="1187924">He also said that during that same conversation, he promised to recommend leniency to the state if the petitioner would cooperate.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.294" offset="1236511">Then and only then, the petitioners said “Yes, I did sell it to him”.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.366" offset="1272874">This confession of a guilt of the petitioner brought out by Illinois on direct examination of his own witness, we submit was timely objected to on the basis of having -- the confession having been induced by promises of immunity at the trial level.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.596" offset="1345808">And the objection was preserved by a later motion to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.162" offset="1363989">And the statement was also made at that time that the objection was made because the confession was made under promises of leniency.</text>

            <text syncTime="357.017" offset="1531486">Well, in my interpretation, I would say that it was in that -- the general statement was made that the petitioner had been denied her rights since I understand it because she -- this confession was coerced, in view of the fact that she was threatened with having children taken away from her, that was brought out, but it was not specifically spelled out, that the particular provision of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was being violated.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.485" offset="1681324">I believe that the Supreme Court certificate -- I would say first that even without the Supreme Court's certificate, by looking at the evidence as a whole that -- it would not beyond -- be beyond the realm of reasonableness to say that the question was actually brought up.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.608" offset="1741824">But in view of the fact that it was raised very specifically in the Supreme Court's brief, and in view of the fact, the certificate from the Illinois Supreme Court states that it did consider the constitutional question, that he did consider it, and then it was necessary for its decision, I think would render the question moot in the view of all of these.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.272" offset="1996466">How is that federal claim verbalized in this Court's order, do you remember them?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jewel_lafontant" startTime="476.491" stopTime="839.619">
            <label>Ms. Jewel Lafontant</label>
            <text syncTime="476.491" offset="2009318">The order the Supreme Court of the United States was directed to the Illinois Supreme Court to answer the question whether or not the Illinois Supreme Court had considered pages 66 of petitioner's brief in the Supreme Court and it was quoted that it was unfair to make a promise -- mimic on a promise, coerce a confession and then use that confession as evidence, that's what was substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.063" offset="2151633">And the Illinois Supreme Court answered and said that it did consider that question, the federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.960" offset="2195205">I believe I do have a copy of that order in my notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.132" offset="2227911">Now, I -- we submit that the in -- inadmissibility of this confession was presented in the appeal brief just referred to before the Supreme Court of Illinois and again raised with particularity in the petitioner's -- petition for a rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.374" offset="2292903">The Attorney General of Illinois argues that the constitutional question was not aptly asserted in accordance with Illinois principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.304" offset="2328639">He ignores the nature of the right claimed by petitioner to have been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.592" offset="2353716">You well know that a similar question was raised and passed upon by this Court in Brown versus Mississippi, 297 U.S. 276.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.512" offset="2393422">And it said on the following words, “That contention rest upon the failure of counsel for the accused, who had objected to the admissibility of the confessions to move for their exclusion after they had been introduced and the fact of coercion had been proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.004" offset="2467401">It is a contention which proceeds upon a misconception of the nature of petitioner's complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.375" offset="2492897">That complaint is not of the commission of mere error but of a wrong so fundamental, that it made the whole proceeding a mere pretense of the trial, and rendered the conviction and sentence wholly void.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.840" offset="2546709">We're not concerned with a mere question of state practice, or where the counsel assigned the petitioners were competent or mistakenly assumed that their first objections were sufficient.”</text>
            <text syncTime="623.514" offset="2597386">If the Attorney General of Illinois contends the principles of trials and appellate judicature of a state would be sufficient to withdraw from the consideration of this Court, violation of such substitute rights as here presented, it would be tantamount to giving a state the right to nullify the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.738" offset="2690278">Such preemptive rights, we submit, are inconceivable.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.265" offset="2712430">This Court has long held that the confession obtained by promises of leniency, duress, or coercion when admitted over the objection of the defendant vitiates the whole proceeding and is a denial of the Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.134" offset="2783901">It is true that in this case we didn't have the gross brutality that we have in the Brown versus Mississippi one.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.617" offset="2809814">But this Court has also recognized the coercion of the mind is of the same nature and sometimes greater than physical violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.439" offset="2849102">In Spano versus New York, 360 U.S. 315, the investigators extracts the confession from the defendant by having his close friend Bruno urged the defendant to confess.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.601" offset="2905736">Because Bruno, who was a fledging police officer, stated to Spano, that if he didn't confess, that he would be in a bad spot, and because of a prior phone call in an admission that it had been made to Bruno.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.023" offset="2963414">And in that case, it was held that the confession was really involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.775" offset="2986506">And I know, Chief Justice Warren remembers it and knows in much more thoroughly than I could ever hope to.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.219" offset="3012211">In Brown versus United States at 168 U.S. 532, there's another instance of a similar case.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.820" offset="3046693">In this case and when I say a similar case, a case where actual brutality wasn't used.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.482" offset="3077308">The defendant Brown was induced into incriminating himself after the police officer told him, “Brown said he saw you do the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.739" offset="3114297">I'm satisfied you do murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.892" offset="3122970">You must have had an accomplice.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.778" offset="3130493">If so, you should say so and not have the blame of this horrible crime on your shoulders.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1564.870" offset="6362885">But the line of cases, with the Spano versus New York case, Malinski versus New York 324 U.S. 401, and Blackburn versus Alabama 361 U.S. 199, this Court has held that a conviction obtained by use of coerced confessions will be set aside even though the evidence apart from the confession might have been sufficient to sustain the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.126" offset="6471868">The respondent further advances the theory that involuntary confessions admitted over the objection of the defendant, do not violate the constitutional provision of the Fourteenth Amendment when the personality of the trier of facts have changed from that of the jury to the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.155" offset="6539995">We submit that the waiver of a jury by the defendant cannot be claimed to be a waiver of the basic constitutional guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.028" offset="6579493">In its opinion, the Supreme Court as you've heard stated that strong suggestions of leniency were made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.200" offset="6616168">But that after looking at a review of the entire record, the Supreme Court said, “We are convinced that the evidence fully supports the judgment of the trial court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.852" offset="6658800">In the light of Spano line of cases heretofore referred to, we submit that this was error, that the admission of the involuntary confession of petitioner over her objections vitiated the whole proceeding that the finding of the Supreme Court of Illinois that there was evidence in the record to support the conviction does not add sanctity to conduct long adjudication by this Court as reprehensible and a violation of the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.543" offset="6777501">We, therefore, respectfully pray that this Court set aside the judgment of the Supreme Court of Illinois and remand the case to the state court.</text>
