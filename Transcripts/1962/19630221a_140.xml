            <label>Mr. Henry Waldman</label>
            <text syncTime="45.655" offset="285968">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.067" offset="299656">This is an appeal from a unanimous decision of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, which denied the petitioner, Willner admission to the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.663" offset="378023">Willner commenced or rather applied for admission some 25 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.595" offset="421804">It was denied and he has been fighting for it ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.512" offset="453465">Willner was the son of immigrant parents who were impoverished, and unlike we often read about young men who work their way through college, he not only had work to his way through college, and four years of law school, but he actually had to work his way through elementary school. the reason of the fact that those people were so poor.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.873" offset="594840">Now ordinarily the average young man who applies for admission to the Bar is about the age of 25, 26, 27, when he applied he was a mature man, 36 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.623" offset="681880">He had graduated from the School of Commerce, New York University with a degree of Bachelor of Commercial Science.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.543" offset="725556">He then studied law for four years and graduated first as a Bachelor of Laws and then as a Master of Laws, and that exempted him from having to serve a clerkship in a lawyer's office, and that's very important in this connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.574" offset="837674">He was married, had two children, a boy was suffering from asthma, was living in New York and then decided it would be better if he would move the family to the country, or at least -- and he moved it to Peekskill up in Westchester County.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.650" offset="913951">It's about 30 miles north of the City Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.081" offset="931715">And he had to make a living and what he knew was accounting, he practically finished his accounting course.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.274" offset="968495">So he engaged in business of accounting, and that of course brought him into contact with people who had to do business with, and anyone who participates in the activities of the marketplace is bound to get an occasional cuff, bound to get into disputes like anybody else who engages in business, and he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.637" offset="1117915">He got into a dispute with a lawyer by the name of James Dempsey and I am not going into details regarding it, but he made a bitter enemy of Dempsey.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.942" offset="1183117">In the meanwhile, he had taken the Bar examination, had passed successfully and was ready to be admitted to the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.883" offset="1230869">Now admission into the Bar in New York is delegated to the Appellate Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.893" offset="1266918">The Court of Appeals makes the rules and regulations and delegates the Appellate Division, the business of admitting attorneys to the Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.728" offset="1334314">Naturally the number of lawyers who apply for admission is very large in New York, and so the job of examining the character and fitness of the applicant for admission to the Bar is delegated to a committee of -- termed the Committee on Character and Fitness.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.214" offset="1456253">It consists of ten members and they are all supposed to be eminent lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.296" offset="1492511">Willner having received his certificate from the Board of the Law Examiners then applied to the -- or Bar rather appeared before the Character Committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="422.014" offset="1791457">That office was apparently managed by Weider, and after he got in there he found a motley crowd of subtenants, one was a bookmaker and by that I don't mean one who publishes or writes books, one who takes bets on races, another was a handicapper and as soon as Willner saw what he was in for, he walked out, and meanwhile he gotten into row with Weidner and Weidner's partner also realizing the sort of office was in, dissolved his partnership and walked out.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.678" offset="2614105">Now he -- that was in 1937 and he made additional applications, about five or six more.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.452" offset="2673142">Everyone was denied without opinion, not so much as a three word sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.487" offset="2725282">All unanimously denied, no opinion, and to this day he doesn't know just why he was not admitted to Bar except of course he assumes that the Dempsey and Wieder letters probably are the cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.527" offset="2809501">Now, the right to a trial, in a case of this kind is unquestioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.416" offset="2845027">When I mean a trial, I mean he has the right to face, to confront his accusers, cross examine them and in fact have a trial in the ordinary and the usual course, where common law procedure and rules of evidence are maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.774" offset="2970520">As a matter of fact that right is established as case law in the State of New York and the case of a recoupment.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.740" offset="3030288">That case was argued in 1959, but decided -- published in 1960, that's a long time ago, but that case has never been overruled, modified or qualified to my knowledge and its stare decisis is still in force.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.534" offset="3125478">That case is the law in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.940" offset="3143137">Now that case stated that admission to the Bar was a substandard right.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.710" offset="3178245">In other words, a substantial right to which a man was entitled to confrontation and all.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.139" offset="3227878">Now as a matter of fact, the Character Committee every time is served with papers, never appeared either by serving a reply to the petition or by the personal appearance of one of it's members, all of whom are lawyers or of it's secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.736" offset="3334353">He simply ignored it with a sort of silent content and that man Willner where every few years, he made a new application, denied, the Character Committee didn't appear and the Appellate Division simply denied it without opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.536" offset="3445530">We finally got the petition, which initiated this proceeding was run up by Willner himself, though I think with the aid of a young lawyer friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.834" offset="3522748">In any event he appeared pro se and I only got into it later.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.622" offset="3553886">The petition was denied by the Appellate Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.911" offset="3574993">I made application to the Appellate Division for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals that was necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.549" offset="3605608">Motion denied, then I made an application to the Court of Appeals and to my amazement and joy the application was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.017" offset="3663391">When I of course filed a brief and the other side did not file a brief, when I appeared in Albany before the Court, the other side wasn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.645" offset="3721906">I argued the appeal for about 20 minutes and two days later, they rendered their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.813" offset="3766627">Order of the Appellate Division unanimously affirmed, no opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.114" offset="3799855">The first time that I received a brief was when I filed my petition for certiorari here.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.712" offset="3834232">And then the Attorney General of New York up here filed a brief and from the -- but only really said, was in view of the fact that his application had been denied way back 25 years ago, there's no reason why, the petition should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.702" offset="3950216">And there is that -- although he didn't raise the claims, res judicata and in my reply brief, I would like to state because I think its worth stating in answer to his claim, a distinguished general in the army attended a social function in full dress uniform and his chest covered with medals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.812" offset="4114578">Asked how he got all of these medals, he said the first I got by mistake and the others because of the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.183" offset="4160136">Now the same thing here, the -- having denied his admission in 1936 and they contend that he should be denied admission in the year 1963.</text>

            <text syncTime="1957.006" offset="7931382">Now, the fact of employment was significant because it indicated a non-disclosure of a fact that apparently the committee deemed material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.393" offset="8004942">In view of the fact, this man actually did not require a clerkship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.553" offset="8029602">The committee apparently did not dispose completely of the application in a negative form, but as you will see, as you go through the history of this case, it gave Mr. Willner an opportunity to come in supply whatever information he had to disprove the charges in the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.183" offset="9172093">It is then up to the court to determine what it should do, but the court is in a position where on its own motion, it can direct such a hearing, it can direct that the hearing be held, whenever it wants to in -- if a situation develops that requires a trial-type hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.117" offset="9279822">Most of these cases apparently are disposed by the Character Committee in a manner where they will not receive ex parte any information which the applicant is not given an opportunity to explain or to deny and the position of the committee is that it proceeds only on information which is not ex parte.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.850" offset="9414823">Now, if in connection with any particular application before, the committee has unfavorable information, information that makes it set up its own, and so here, this man must wait, the committee, it seems to me is not acting arbitrarily if it has in its possession unfavorable information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.340" offset="9544704">In this particular case, the assumption is that everything was set against Willner in these first two complaints was credited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.262" offset="9584410">If the complaints were completely credited and as to the first one of the charges was that the man asked for a false affidavit that he had served the clerkship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.440" offset="9625161">I'm sure that if, if the committee had accepted that that it would never have allowed Willner later on and the Court itself would not have allowed Willner at a later day to have filed a new application for admission as it did in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.646" offset="9701961">If it had accepted the second charge, which would in effect was that Willner had engaged in a fraudulent transaction where he promised that he could put through an RFC loan that he had to pay moneys to an RFC employee to bring about the loan, if these charges had been taken in hold -- at face value by the distinguished members of the Bar who constitute this Committee then it seems to me that again the 1948 application would not have been allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.543" offset="9889520">These would have been allegations of a sort that would have so, despite the man's character if accepted that he should not have been allowed to file a second application.</text>
