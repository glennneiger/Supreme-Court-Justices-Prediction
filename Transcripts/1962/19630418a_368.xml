            <text syncTime="35.859" offset="246784">In our situation, the local union and Food Fair negotiated a collective bargaining contract which contained a panoply of many benefits to the employees and Florida being one of the Like to Work states which prohibits the entry into a contract requiring membership in a union pursuant to 14(b).</text>

            <label>Mr. S. G. Lippman</label>
            <text syncTime="78.487" offset="417311">We negotiated what I think could be correctly characterized as a service fee arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.022" offset="471437">In that service fee, and it is set forth on page 9 of the record, although it's called agency shop, I think the Court will recognize that it has substantial differences from the agency shop in the GM case just argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.041" offset="543535">In that service fee arrangement, we provide that under the law of the State of Florida the employees have a right to join and not to join the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.888" offset="590973">However, the union is the exclusive bargaining agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.072" offset="607692">It's been certified, chosen by the employees, and the union has the obligation under the law to represent all the employees equally and impartially.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.469" offset="649279">The union incurs many expenses in connection with this representation and therefore we say in so many words to defray the cost of the union as a collective the bargaining agency, the employees who determine that they do not wish to join the union would be required to pay a service fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.447" offset="749171">In a subsequent notice which we posted, after reiterating the language, we said that the service fee would be the equivalent of the monthly dues and the initiation fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.188" offset="808103">I might point out that the issue before this Court and the issue before the Florida Supreme Court was not the amount of the service fee or the reasonableness of the service fee, but was whether or not one penny could be charged as a service fee arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.697" offset="918131">The rationale if it may please the Court is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.642" offset="945925">A union has the obligation under the law, and the Court has spelled out that obligation, to represent all employees, union and nonunion alike, and to represent them impartially.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.545" offset="1001514">All employees receive these benefits and the record of contract is in the record indicates the substantial benefits involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.895" offset="1042996">Being a collective bargaining agency requires a great deal of expenditures.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.577" offset="1061700">I think that is clear and it's spelled out in the brief, one has to hire attorneys and negotiators and fulltime representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.077" offset="1095659">Committees have to be paid, records have to be kept, contracts have to be administered, cases have to be taken to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.173" offset="1140067">And so we say that if you want the benefits and you have chosen us to obtain benefits for you, we believe that you should pay a prorated cost of carrying on as the collective bargaining agent not as a member of the union, but as a member or an employee within the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.027" offset="1263470">Now, how do we differ from the agency shop?</text>
            <text syncTime="301.936" offset="1311117">The sums which are paid can only be used to defray the cost of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.763" offset="1342464">None of the money could in any way be used for institutional or labor union objectives unrelated to the collective bargaining function of the particular union involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="362.216" offset="1552280">This is actually one of the other small unions, it's rather unusual, but this case does not present the question of the reasonableness of the sum.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.635" offset="1589896">Now, it could very well be that in a subsequent action, in a subsequent proceeding, the reasonableness of the sum could be questioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.161" offset="1891976">Now, I was about to point out and I think I did point out that in no sense can any of the moneys be used for any institutional purposes, that it can only be used for collective bargaining functions, and that the relationship is the relationship between a union and the employees in the bargaining unit and not between a union and its membership.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.930" offset="2115062">Yes, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.168" offset="2124048">I sought to develop forenoon the argument that the contract that we have before us, the particular clauses, we call a service fee arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.256" offset="2184443">It's drafted in the since, requires specifically that employees in a bargaining unit who choose not to be members of the union must pay a service fee to defray the union's ordinary costs in connection with collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.308" offset="2260616">We also tried to make it clear that in issue, is not the amount of the fee, but the principle as to whether or not such a clause in a contract can be nullified by the State of Florida operating under Section 14(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="562.511" offset="2353403">I would like now to discuss the requirements and the limitations of 14(b) as it impinges on the – and raises the Federal preemption problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.901" offset="2426964">14(b) is quite clear, in that it is an exception to the general pattern of the Labor Act and provides in substance that the states are permitted to pass laws specifically prohibiting membership in a labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.744" offset="2542320">Now Congress knew quite well what is meant by membership in a labor organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.675" offset="2566040">It is not a difficult ambiguous word and if there is any uncertainty about the matter, I believe a reference to the legislative history would demonstrate what Congress was concerned with in 8 (a) (3) when they abolished the closed shop and in 14(b), Congress was concerned with the evils of compulsory membership in a union.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.629" offset="2685889">They were concerned with the Cecil De Mille where an employee or a person had to pay assessments for political purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.653" offset="2717968">They were concerned with a situation where an employee was expelled from the union for doing unionism or an employee was -- and lost his job, or an employee who testified against another employee in a Court proceeding was expelled from the union, they were concerned with the abuses of internal unionism.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.679" offset="2802082">In no sense do I find anything in the legislative history, which indicates that Congress was concerned with the payments to the extent that Congress did have such a concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.575" offset="2849625">It did have an amendment, it does have an amendment in the law prohibiting excessive initiation fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.848" offset="2878777">Beyond that, there was no concern with that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.112" offset="2891839">On the other hand, Congress did throughout manifest a concern about a fee right.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.843" offset="2918693">Now, since we have this exception, since the language of 14(b) is so clear, is a State justified in taking the position that 14(b) goes beyond what it says, that is a validation of its Right-to-work laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.286" offset="3012524">What the states do is they interrupt their own laws and then they say this stems from 14(b) we have the authority to do so under 14(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="739.079" offset="3059649">Now what abuses have we seen?</text>
            <text syncTime="742.085" offset="3071666">We have cases coming from the Supreme Court of South Carolina and Arkansas outlawing the hiring-hall based upon the presumed authority under 14(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="758.151" offset="3135927">We have a case in the Supreme Court of Georgia where they took the position, where the Court took the position that an exclusive bargaining contract could not stand in face of its Right-to-work law again stemming from the authority of 14(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="773.941" offset="3199143">And we have the opinion of the Attorney General in South Dakota to the same extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.515" offset="3225475">The states do not look to the language of 14(b) to its intent, but they look to their own Right-to-work laws and under the guidance of that, they believe 14(b) is a license for them to regulate all aspects or many aspects of labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.429" offset="3301125">In this respect, I raise the question of preemption, clearly where a State were to go outside the authority of 14(b) and say that you cannot negotiate on a particular subject, that you cannot negotiate a hiring-hall or that you cannot negotiate a contract benefiting employees and seeking a service fee in return, where it is not clearly covered by the language and where quite arguably it is covered by the provisions of the Federal Act and actually protect it and where it is not clear at all that the states have such authority, it seems to me, if we are going to obtain any kind of uniformity in the first instance, it should be the Labor Board, which would have primary jurisdiction to determine whether or not the particular subject matter folds within the scope of 14(b) and is subject to regulation by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.232" offset="3560260">Otherwise, we will have at the moment 20 different states each interpreting 14(b) and carrying rights under the Labor Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1756.471" offset="7129213">We have thousands of contracts throughout the country requiring a union shop arrangement, requiring employees to join union after 30 days of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.507" offset="7173413">Now, the only problem we have there is that the union shop cannot be enforced in such a way as to jeopardize the employee's job rights, so long as he continues to pay his union dues, but that does not mean that he does not have the obligation that the employer does not have the obligation to see to it that the employee joins the union otherwise Congress just did not say what it meant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1817.420" offset="7373093">Now the argument that 14(b) therefore is also an agency shop prohibition, stems from that kind of a fallacy, that 8 (a) (3) is nothing but an agency shop, but if 8 (a) (3) were in fact as I believe it to be a union shop, but with qualifications as to how you can administer it, then the entire argument would fall because then you could read 14(b) in it's exact language namely giving the state's authority only to prohibit membership in the union and not to prohibit any kind of a fee payment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.768" offset="9174392">The question presented to this Court in the petition for the writ of certiorari was whether the Florida Supreme Court misconstrued Section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act in holding that it authorizes the states both to prohibit and to regulate an agency shop clause in an interstate labor contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.602" offset="9261746">After this Court granted certiorari, and as I understand the rules of this Court, the certiorari is to be limited to the questions presented in the petition for writ of certiorari, then the union switched its attack and now refers to a service fee arrangement, which is supposed to be something separate and distinct from an agency shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.600" offset="9349726">And I will quote the eminent Solicitor General when he before referred to a question from Mr. Justice Brennan that there is no difference between an agency shop and an union shop and I believe he labeled it in Latin as “Tweedledum, Tweedledee.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.274" offset="9412420">I will say that a service fee arrangement is the same thing as an agency shop for arrangement on the basis of the record that was presented to the Florida Court and the record that is before this United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.868" offset="9470830">The record clearly shows, as Mr. Justice White observed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.846" offset="9494758">All we have before this Court and all we had before the Florida Supreme Court was a complaint, wherein the complaint referred to an agency shop provision, wherein the complaint had affixed to it as exhibits, a so-called important notice to employees which is on page 7 of the record, and also had affixed to it as an exhibit on page 8 of the record, the particular provision in the union contract referring to an agency shop clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.154" offset="9615966">Nowhere in the contract is there a reference to a service fee clause, but only a reference to an agency shop clause and the petition for writ of certiorari to this Court in 19 places in the petition for writ of certiorari and the brief they referred to an agency shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.720" offset="9694229">Now, what has the union asked for non-union employees of Food Fair to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.961" offset="9727248">They have told these employees that you do not have to belong to union if you want to work here for Food Fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.166" offset="9756087">We very graciously say you don't have to belong to union, but if you want to keep on working here as a condition of employment, you must pay to the union the same amount of money that the union member will pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.230" offset="9812302">And because some of the employees of Food Fair may not be too literate, the union very graciously posted an important notice to the employees to explain the agency shop to these employees and stated, because many of you, which notice is page 7 of the record, because many of you may not be too familiar with the meaning and purpose of an agency shop, a few words of explanation may be in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.194" offset="9916165">And they explained that under an agency shop that even though the Union and the Company have agreed that you may not have joined the union, you are obligated under the provisions of the agency shop to pay an initial service fee, which is the equal of the initiation fee for union members and a monthly service fee, which is equal of the monthly dues for those who voluntarily become union members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.805" offset="10018565">This is the same provision that is in the General Motors case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.591" offset="10037687">They are asked to pay the same amount of money as union members, which is more onerous than the situation that you have with a person who voluntarily becomes a union member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.627" offset="10081886">Now many people, the majority of the people in the State of Florida and in 19 other right-to-work states, have by election determined that they do not wish to be members of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.313" offset="10132668">That unionism is a matter of voluntary choice, is a voluntary freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.881" offset="10154924">I believe if a person wants to join the union, they have all the right in the world to join the union and they should be able to join the union if they so desire, but if at the same time, if a person wishes to refrain from being a member of the union, that person should also have that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2528.783" offset="10218454">However, what is being proposed actually by the union in this particular case is that after the Supreme Court in three cases has upheld the constitutionality of the right-to-work laws of states, has now said that your efforts, you work has all been in vain, because even though states may have right-to-work laws and even though it was the intent of Congress in Section 14 (b) to permit states to continue to have right-to-work laws, the union has now said you can forget those right-to-work laws, you can forget the congressional intent, because now we have come up with a new arrangement, a service fee arrangement whereby, we might say to the union member or to the employee, you don't have to pay the same amount of money as a union member, you just have to pay a service fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.132" offset="10411865">Maybe the service fee might be ten cents less than what a union member would have to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.237" offset="10436315">Maybe we can setup an elaborate bookkeeping or accounting system, whereby we will say the money that came from employee X, who is a non-union member, will be used to pay the cost of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.533" offset="10485530">The money that comes from employee Y, who is a union member that money we will use for political contributions, we will use it to pay nice big salaries, we'll use it to buy a building, we'll use it, we will use it for contribution to some worthwhile charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.181" offset="10548120">How is the average union employee or the average non-union employee able to determine what portion of this so-called service fee which is being exacted from him or her without her concern, how can they determine whether or not that is being used for collective bargaining purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2667.605" offset="10773817">The argument on that is the fact that the State has enacted a right-to-work law, which says if a person does not have to be a member of the union, and which would also mean that the person does not have to financially assist the union if that person does not wish to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.273" offset="10836511">I say that the unions have been entrusted by Congress with being the exclusive bargaining agent of all the persons in the bargaining unit that that is something that the unions themselves have sought and asked by Congress that the unions in becoming the exclusive bargaining agent for every employee who is in the bargaining end and has actually now deprived the non-union employee of the right to be able to contract and bargain for himself, for herself, and in this particular instance, even in the contract which is affixed to the complaint, we have a situation, one of my clients is a woman who has been working for Food Fair for over eight years who would have a certain amount of substantial seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.931" offset="11019055">This contract, which they allege gives people many benefits, this contract specifically provides in Section 3, page six of the contract which is on page 13 of the record, specifically provides that on layoffs and transfers, stewards, union stewards shall enjoy super seniority.</text>

            <text syncTime="2879.170" offset="11620080">The white local was paying regular dues and fees into the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.970" offset="11639202">The colored local was not paying any dues and fees, and the union said that it costs us so much money to take care of grievances and arbitration, we are now going to setup a $15 fee for grievance and we are going to setup an arbitration expense of $400 and those of you who are non-union members will have to pay that money into the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.188" offset="11732093">The National Labor Relations Board almost revoked the certification of the union and did not do it only because of the fact that they revoked the certification of the union for seeking to get this type of an assessment; that, that would have the effect of putting the colored local, deprive the colored local of the certification, so they gave them a warning and told him that they could not have that.</text>
