            <text syncTime="34.585" offset="241664">There are presently 63 colored school children attending desegregated schools in the City of Memphis.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.550" offset="273533">The program of desegregation was commenced in the Fall of 1961 with the first grade and in the Fall of 1962 the second and third grades were desegregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.421" offset="329017">These 63 school children do not include an undetermined number of colored children who were assigned to the desegregated schools, but who asked to be reassigned to all colored schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.410" offset="397040">I don't have that number, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.460" offset="409161">I might state this with respect to the schools because it does have considerable relevancy here that on May the 22nd next there is scheduled a hearing in the District Court at Memphis.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.823" offset="478647">Both the Board of Education and the NAACP have presented proposed plans for further integration of the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.293" offset="524518">Under the NAACP plan, the first six grades would be integrated this Fall and seven, eight, and nine in the Fall of 1964 and the remaining grades in the Fall of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.566" offset="597661">Under the Board of Education plan, the first four grades would be integrated this year and then one grade a year here after until the program is terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.341" offset="648756">So that is the situation with respect to schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="139.836" offset="662758">Now with respect to the parochial school and that has some relevance because the Park Commission operates playgrounds on parochial school property.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.068" offset="703613">Bishop Adrian of Nashville has recently announced that the parochial schools in Tennessee would commence their program of desegregation this Fall on a gradual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.022" offset="755440">Now, up to address myself to the problem at hand, the recreational facilities of the City of Memphis.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.241" offset="788355">The undisputed proof shows these facts, may it please the Court that 56 of the 117 supervised playgrounds, which accommodate 100,000 children in supervised play, are on school and Church property.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.722" offset="878216">The Park Commission in its thinking and in evolving its plan with respect to complying with the Brown case felt that it would not be wise to desegregate the playgrounds on the Church properties and the school properties until those institutions themselves were desegregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.914" offset="971003">It was thought that that would not be in the best interest of the people as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.261" offset="1000364">Yes sir?</text>

            <text syncTime="249.932" offset="1103078">Not all of it, if Your Honor please, some of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.838" offset="1114676">For instance basketball takes place in the school gymnasiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.398" offset="1132962">Of course baseball would take place on the school playgrounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.814" offset="1146650">Most of it would take place after school hours, but much of the supervised play would take place during the school terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.635" offset="1189909">A great portion of it of course takes place in the summer time.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.803" offset="1206627">And I would judge that the greater percentage of the supervised play does take place in the summer time when the schools are not in session.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.952" offset="1251140">But with respect to basketball and baseball and other activities the recreational activity does take place during the school time.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.717" offset="1302235">Now, the proof also shows this, may it please the Court, with respect to all of the 117 playgrounds that if the relief sought here is granted and all of the playgrounds are desegregated at the same time that the supervisory staff that now supervises the play of these 100,000 children will not be adequate and that more supervisors will have to be trained and employed to give proper supervision and proper protection to these children during this transition period, it's contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.378" offset="1492929">The necessary result of that, may it please the Court, would be that a large number of children would not receive the benefits of supervised play that they are now receiving and the Park Commission feels that that is tremendously important thing for all of the people of Memphis, especially to keep the children off the streets during the summer vacation period.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.596" offset="1605778">And I don't believe that I need any citation of authority otherwise to demonstrate how important that is to any city.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.339" offset="1644753">This playground system of Memphis, we feel, is one of the finest in the country and we feel that it has been developed over a period of years to the point where it is one of the most important facets of our community life.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.605" offset="1709746">We recognize, may it please the Court that we must comply with the established law that all of the playgrounds must be open to all children colored and white, but we feel that additional time yet is necessary, recognizing that it has been eight years since the Brown decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.413" offset="1812982">But we feel that experience has shown that where this program can be developed on a gradual basis without an injunction hanging over the heads of our people and authority that we can develop it in such a way that it will not create confusion or disarray and will give protection and supervision to all of these children.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.836" offset="1946728">The Park Commission certainly from the concurrent finding of both Lower Courts has acted in unquestioned good faith in trying to carry out what we felt was the law as announced in the second Brown decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.119" offset="2023842">But we feel that some additional time is necessary, bearing in the mind that the only question before this Court is whether or not the Lower Courts had any discretion save to issue an immediate injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.347" offset="2092805">The adequacy of the plan that I filed on yesterday, the adequacy of any plan has never been presented to the District Court or to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.097" offset="2139721">This appeal was taken before we had an opportunity to allow the District Judge to adjudicate with respect to the full plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.244" offset="2184338">And as I stated yesterday, we don't say that this plan that we've got enough is the magic answer or that it will be adequate or that it will be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.527" offset="2233448">It is the best plan that we've been able to devise and we feel that the District Judge should have an opportunity to adjudicate with respect to that plan and if it is inadequate to accelerate it or to take what other steps might be necessary, that's our position.</text>

            <text syncTime="558.233" offset="2336266">I understood Mrs. Motley to say that practically all or at least a great many of the parts that you have desegregated were merely little squares or little triangles that, where they had a statue and a few -- in a few chair, few seats that people could sit in.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.660" offset="2426023">Is that the fact then and if so how many general playgrounds have you in these last nine years desegregated for the use of all people?</text>

            <text syncTime="592.477" offset="2473253">If Your Honor please in answer to your question, I would take issue with counsel on her statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.239" offset="2508361">I can't tell you how many of the 130 I believe parks and 117 playgrounds have been desegregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.798" offset="2550575">I will try to give you now some of the facilities that have been desegregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.889" offset="2586937">Six of the seven public golf courses, Crump Stadium, which was alluded to, has been desegregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.459" offset="2621210">The public zoo, the fairground, the lake boat dock and several, I'm not prepared to say exactly how many, several playgrounds have already been desegregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.113" offset="2679829">Several were desegregated last year and the program calls for additional desegregation this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.703" offset="2714206">But many, many parks and many, many facilities have been desegregated under the plan that's already been evolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.983" offset="2759346">And the Park Commission is complying with -- yes sir, counsel reminds me that all the tennis courts have been desegregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.171" offset="2800097">And I am safe in making this statement that there is no activity sponsored by the Park Commission which is not now open to both races.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.226" offset="2852237">There is no as distinguished from a particular playground at a particular place.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.375" offset="2876897">There are many playgrounds which are still segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.657" offset="2898004">Most of them are neighborhood playgrounds, but there is no activity now except the Pink Palace Museum and it stands in a different light and I don't believe that it is going to be a significant problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.397" offset="2956936">In fact I think that it is very minor when considered in the light of the whole program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2207.148" offset="8931976">Again, I submit to the Court that the question herein involved is whether or not the District Court and the Court of Appeals had any discretion save to issue an immediate injunction that was the only issue there, it's the only issue before this Court and if we are inadequate in our plans then that can be corrected and the Trial Judge will correct it, I'm sure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2282.460" offset="9233220">And as it appears on page 45 of the typewritten transcript of the testimony, at that time, the Superintendent of the parks was going over the list of all the facilities and he had in his hand Plaintiff's Exhibit 6 and he has the summary of all these facilities and there is one category on the top marked “General” and the Counsel examining him said, “Doesn't general mean these -- he said alright, in this category called general up there, number one, aren't they what you mean to say these parks with just benches and places like Fort Square, are they?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.763" offset="9406464">Answer; “That is correct,” so that the facilities which were desegregated were mainly these squares with statues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.275" offset="9444498">In fact, one of them is I think a little strip of land near the river with four or five benches and they call that a park, but actually it's just a little square that's been desegregated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2502.373" offset="10112815">Now as to the more supervisors -- I think the answer to that was there -- desegregation is that, if 20,000 new white children should move into Memphis as the Sixth Circuit said in the Clemens case, the local authorities would take care of that and they would provide more supervisors or whatever is required to accommodate an additional increase in white children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.834" offset="10242696">And the other thing is that there is more confusion now as a result of this gradualism and not less because Negroes are not advised when these parks are desegregated, they don't know which park they can go in and as the record says, you don't know until you go there and the policeman doesn't chase you and you can go.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.243" offset="10328377">So, this has resulted in more confusion rather than less.</text>
