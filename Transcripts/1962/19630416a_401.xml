            <text syncTime="133.600" offset="637785">At the time the suit was brought in the middle -- in the District Court in Macon, Georgia, it was alleged that the defendant prime contractor had begun purported arbitration proceedings in the City of New York in connection with the balance due to Mr. Moseley.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.427" offset="717093">Our petition was brought in -- our complaint brought in six counts, two of them seeking to recover directly on the contract, the next -- and the two contracts, one at Robins, one at Turner Air Force Base.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.190" offset="768084">The next two counts seeking to rescind those contracts because of fraud of the prime contractor as detailed in the complaint, and seeking thereunder to recover on quantum meruit for the value of the work done, and the other two counts with respect to the two contracts saying, “Even if we're not entitled to recover on the letter of the contract, even if we can't show enough fraud to rescind it and recover in quantum meruit, we are nevertheless entitled to recover the value of the work that was done, less was been paid and any damage sustained by defendant.”</text>
            <text syncTime="199.741" offset="902353">It was alleged that the complainant could not possibly present his case before an Arbitration Board in the City of New York, some six or seven hundred miles from Macon, Georgia where the plaintiff lived, where his witnesses resided, where the Government records were available by which he could prove his case, and that he just simply could not properly present his case before an arbitration panel even if it could be properly presented if the evidence were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.882" offset="1026905">The trial judge found that enforcement of a contract provision purporting to provide that any claim or dispute be settled by arbitration was contrary to the public policy of Miller Act, and refused to grant the motion of the defendant for a stay of the District Court suit while arbitration was undertaken in New York, and continued to enforce an injunction against him, proceeding with the arbitration in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.679" offset="1158040">Upon appeal by the defendant to the Fifth Circuit, the District Court was reversed in a two to one decision, two judges holding that the stay for arbitration should have been granted and Judge Reeves dissenting, agreeing with the trial judge that enforcement of an arbitration provision was in violation of the public policy of the Miller Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1794.235" offset="7280306">And this Court has had occasion to point out very distinctly the difference in the substantive rights of the parties that may result from proceeding by arbitration rather in the court of law and that was done in the case of Barnhart versus Polygraphic Company in hundredth law edition when I use it refer to 350 U.S. that is the recent decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.182" offset="7404126">They rendered it by arbitration, whatever its merits or shortcomings, it substantially affects the cause of action, the nature of the tribunal where a suit is tried is a -- is an important part of the parcel of rights behind the cause of action. Change from a court of law to an arbitration panel may make a radical difference and ultimate results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.091" offset="7479777">And in no point in my reading further from that that's in the brief but I wanted to invite the Court's attention this time to the fact there is such a radical difference in the substantive rights in the final outcome between whether you travel by a court suit or by arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.768" offset="7550412">And then they ask the court to consider the language of the Miller Act itself when we are talking about the background of it and the Heard Act in its deficiencies permitting people to be delayed who were entitled to their money and the fact that Congress intended to correct that deficiency by enactment of the Miller Act, and then that they put into it language that won't be found in any other statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.932" offset="7643094">And I think it's significant that in this case, in the brief of respondent just as in the Circuit Court opinion, they dwell at length doing that part of the Miller Act which says that every suit shall be brought in the United States District Court of the district in which work were to be performed and not elsewhere, but the brief of respondent doesn't text these words which to me are unequivocal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.976" offset="7739225">It's set out that they keep me stay because they say if a man had -- the act itself says every person, and we're talking about laborers, subcontractor, materialmen who is furnished labor and material and who hadn't been paid in 90 days shall have the right to sue on such payment bond for the amount or the balance they have unpaid at the time of the institution [Inaudible] and to prosecute said action to final execution in judgment for the sum or sums just and due to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.901" offset="7858970">Now if Congress had every intended that you had a right to sue but after [Inaudible] suit, you had to set it aside and let it be stayed while you ran off up to New York and arbitrate, if it eventuated in search result then those words would have been put in there, they would have stop by saying, “Shall have the right sue”.</text>

            <text syncTime="1978.722" offset="8018213">And prosecute means to carry on, it means the exact opposite of stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.895" offset="8034931">To stay a suit means wait a while as I use to say in the country stay means wait and prosecute means carry on or get up as we said to amicus.</text>

            <text syncTime="2785.612" offset="11245798">I mentioned there's a time limit within which you must bring a suit to the District Court, that's one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.517" offset="11265442">And a man must bring a suit even if you say it can be stayed for arbitration because his time would run out while he's off somewhere arbitrating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.284" offset="11304521">Therefore, he's got to go to New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.761" offset="11310373">He's got to hire two sets of lawyer, one in Macon, Georgia and some more in New York to handle the arbitration provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.757" offset="11338376">I have mentioned that if this were valid the prime contractor could require every laborer to sign the similar agreement and could require his subcontractor to get a similar agreement from everyone, his laborers and materialmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.079" offset="11383724">And that the surety could impose as a requirement for his writing the bond that the prime contract to punish him such agreement from all the subs and all materialmen of off's and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2840.917" offset="11467003">It was decided under the Heard Act which preceded this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.889" offset="11482885">That the United States itself is so much interested in the preservation and protection of the rights granted by the statute that it is not just a nominal, but a real point to such a suit brought in the name of the United States for the use of the materialmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.633" offset="11545893">That was held in the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company versus United States of America and I'm sorry this case is not on my brief in 204 U.S. 349 where this Court pointed out the United States is not here nearly no -- nominal or formal party.</text>

            <text syncTime="2882.825" offset="11634709">It was a principle party to the contract and in view of the words of the statute maybe said to have an interest in the performance of all of its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.766" offset="11666474">It maybe that the interest of the Government has involved in the construction of public works will be [Inaudible] if contracts to this for such works are able to obtain materials and supplies with certainty and prompt, to that end Congress may have been that important to assure those who furnish such material or supplies that the Government would exert its power directly for their protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.278" offset="11752469">It may well have thought that the Government was under some obligation to guard the interest of those whose labor and materials would go into a public building.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.441" offset="11789145">That same thing applicable to the Heard Act is even more applicable to the Miller Act because this Court has said the reason for the Miller Act was to remove some of these procedural difficulties and to make it easier for unpaid laborers and materialmen to realize the benefit of this bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.999" offset="11855391">One of the Circuit Courts has characterized a bond on which you can't sue as being an empty gesture and a [Inaudible] carried out by the contractor in the surety of public expense and that certainly would be true as to the bond here.</text>
