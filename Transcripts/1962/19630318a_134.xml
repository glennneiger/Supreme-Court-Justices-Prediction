            <label>Mr. John H. Fitzgerald</label>
            <text syncTime="16.315" offset="168626">Mr. Chief Justice and honorable Justices of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.375" offset="192867">May it please the Court, for a moment I would just like to review the factual situation concerned with this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="31.304" offset="228603">This case involves an infraction of Title 26 of the U.S. Code, which requires any person in the business of accepting wagers to have a federal tax stamp, further to register as a so-called acceptor of such wagers with the local Internal Revenue Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.724" offset="322226">David Namet was accused of failing to have done this.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.795" offset="350542">The treasury agents for sometime conducted a surveillance of Mr. Namet, during which period they followed him about.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.827" offset="382725">They saw him visiting on a couple of times a week various variety stores, which had a reputation for accepting wagers.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.474" offset="421282">At no time in their entire surveillance, which consumed over a month, did they ever see the defendant, the petitioner here, accept one bet, one wager for himself or anybody else or did they find any -- during that period of surveillance, any kind of evidence upon his person.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.691" offset="526085">The evidence offered by the government's eyewitnesses was to the effect that the surveillance was conducted in the month of March during one of the fabled New England winters of course where an automobile could be used and when it couldn't, the petitioner would go on foot.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.459" offset="601213">This time he wore a three-quarter length coat, which paired with patch pockets.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.647" offset="629948">Witnesses testified to the effect that as he went into the different stores, his pockets were perceptibly filled when he came out while there were perceptibly empty when he went in.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.530" offset="685537">A raid was eventually conducted in the city of Chelsea, Massachusetts to the North of Boston, at which time the Treasury Agents went into the house of Namet.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.357" offset="728795">There they found an envelope containing -- three envelopes containing a total of $700, $75 and $50 and $186 in cash on defendant Namet's peron.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.623" offset="789817">They found miscellaneous items of pieces of paper with numbers on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.488" offset="809357">Political cards, pencils, paper, unused pads, three slips in his wallet the size of 3x5 pad containing some numbers there on, none of which was dated in anyway except for three items, two of which were mere information items called half slips; they were dated 1948 and 1949 I believe.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="207.196" offset="932133">What's a half slip?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_h_fitzgerald" startTime="208.743" stopTime="264.598">
            <label>Mr. John H. Fitzgerald</label>
            <text syncTime="208.743" offset="938297">A half slip Your Honor is a card where the better puts in a number to a person engaged in a business of taking wagers.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.976" offset="987303">Should numbers they play come up so frequently, they are only paid half of the odds, which another number would pay the full extent of the odds.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.811" offset="1030666">These are merely for information purposes and I suppose they found as has been testified by experts in these various cases and through the course of the year or so as the numbers come out repeatedly in the newspapers, they are taken from newspapers by the way, should numbers repeat themselves with such a frequency, that it's unfair to the so-called man who accepts a wager to have him pay the full amount of the bet, so therefore he only pays half, they are just information.</text>

            <text syncTime="270.609" offset="1185834">But these are not for sale, they are given away and there was some other -- and there was one other envelope in the defendant Namet's house, which had a date February with no specific day Your Honor but 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.601" offset="1257827">About this evidence which was taken in his house, his son appeared and testified on behalf of his father and parenthetically and coincidentally his son happens to be a practicing lawyer in Massachusetts, Office of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.756" offset="1318431">He testified to the effect of this material, this pile of pencils and papers have been around the house for years to his knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.462" offset="1353226">The money and the envelopes was the proceeds of an insurance policy left over after they had buried his mother with -- recently before this so-called raid.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.894" offset="1406934">At the trial, it was during the same raid in another part of the city, same agents picked up a husband and a wife Irving and Annette Kahn.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.346" offset="1460746">Present Counsel appeared for all three.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.494" offset="1477360">For reasons best known to Counsel, he suggested that the Kahns change their plea of guilty to not guilty, which they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.149" offset="1519992">While changing their plea to guilty and at the same time, the Namet trial was to proceed on a not guilty basis for a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.831" offset="1570670">The United States Attorney had the United States Marshall present serve the two Kahns with a summons.</text>

            <text syncTime="450.792" offset="1906500">So, at that particular moment upon their plea of guilty, they were served with a summons to be Government witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.919" offset="1935026">While it isn't a matter of any record this took place down the back of the courtroom during a recess.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.177" offset="1960103">Counsel advised the United States Attorney that he would instruct the Kahns about their rights to further incrimination and that he believed that they would avail themselves of the privilege under the Fifth Amendment of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.298" offset="2028544">The trial then started the case of Namet and jury was impaneled and Namet -- the government made their opening.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.446" offset="2069191">Of course, the Counsel believed that he had to wait until the opening was made to be sure of what was going to be said.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.287" offset="2096567">In the opening, the Government Attorney stated to the jury that he would produce two witnesses, a husband and wife who he believed would testify against the defendant Namet.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.797" offset="2146513">Once he finished his opening, Counsel, the Government and Defense Counsel approached the bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.745" offset="2170337">There ensued one of many bench conferences, which is replayed in the transcript and which isn't in the transcript many, many lobby conferences ensued beside that, over a period of two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.316" offset="2224671">The principle issue was whether the government could use the Kahns as witnesses, which raises the salient issue that the Counsel brings before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.387" offset="2268871">So, whether the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts erred in permitting two witnesses, the husband and wife, namely the Kahns, who had pleaded guilty in a separate, similar but separate case involving the same crime to take the stand over not only to Petitioner's objection, but over their own Counsel's objection when both the Court and the prosecution knew in advance that such witnesses would invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege against further self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.193" offset="2400110">From the beginning, in reliance upon this, the Counsel has cited throughout his brief, the United States versus Maloney in 1959 where Mr. Justice Hand, Learned Hand of New York in the Second Circuit held that in a similar instance, it wasn't quite as similar as this, because the witness on the stand was not -- had never been a defendant in the case, the particular witness involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.050" offset="2527587">But the attorney for one of the defendants there also represented the witness testifying and he requested the Court to advice the witness of his constitutional privileges, which the Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.885" offset="2582862">Despite that, the witness was compelled to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.977" offset="2599267">Justice Hand in reviewing the doings of that Court stated that it was reversible error to force a witness to take the stand under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.804" offset="2646601">And as in this case here, the government knew in advance as did the Court below that the Kahns who undoubtedly were essential to the government's case, but whether they are a necessity in the government's case should overshadow the danger and would say were headed to further incriminate themselves and subject themselves to further indictment is one of the issues before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.553" offset="2777631">Counsel advised the Court immediately following the government's opening to the jury and the bench conferences to which I had alluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.680" offset="2818069">While the Kahns had admittedly confessed their guilt to failure to fulfill the requirements of the 26th United States Code, I believe it was Sections 44/11 and 44/12, they had only pleaded guilty to a conceivable conspiracy, which could arise out of any testimonial in their part.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.653" offset="2917961">They had only pleaded guilty to conceivable bribery of a Federal Official to income tax evasion, Federal income tax evasion and they were compelled to take the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.778" offset="2982536">It was felt by Counsel, who not withstanding the government's brief, was not trying to engineer a case, but was looking out for the best interest of the Kahns and they coincidentally represented during this trial to not further subject themselves to future incrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1846.992" offset="7491375">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.660" offset="7509974">This case is here on direct review of the Petitioner's criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.683" offset="7530141">As opposing counsel has stated he was found guilty of violation of the Internal Revenue code by failing to register and pay the taxes as to one engaged in the business of accepting wagers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.144" offset="7587924">At this trial, the government called Mr. and Mrs. Kahn, proprietors of a variety store in Chelsea and people who had admitted to revenue agents that they had acted as agents in their store for petitioner in the wagering operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.639" offset="7657932">They had, as stated here, also pleaded guilty to separate information, making charges based upon their actions involving the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.893" offset="7706937">There are two issues; the first issue raised and the only issue raised by the Petitioner is, whether the government was properly permitted to call Mr. and Mrs. Kahn, where the Petitioner's lawyer had informed the court and the government that he had advised them to plead their privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.205" offset="7792201">Essentially, we believe this issue is whether the Defense Counsel may block material witnesses and material and relevant evidence by informing the Court before trial that he has advised those witnesses to claim their privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.019" offset="7863463">We believe that nothing in the history of the Fifth Amendment would warrant giving this control over an opposing party's case to the opposing Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.980" offset="7911320">The parties must be free to call and question witnesses known to be able to give relevant evidence so that each party may present his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.968" offset="7959280">There is a second issue --</text>

            <text syncTime="1966.492" offset="7969311">Before you get the second issue, did the Kahns tell the prosecutor themselves that they would not testify or did it just come from the counsel?</text>

            <text syncTime="1975.714" offset="8006196">It only came from Counsel, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.174" offset="8020093">The second issue, which I will just state, was called to the attention of the Court by the government in our memorandum response to the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.628" offset="8065860">And it concerns the cautionary instruction, which the Court gave on the inferences which could or could not be drawn from the claim of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.664" offset="8105984">The question here is, whether that instruction, which we concede to have been defective, was so prejudicial as to require a new trial where there was no objection prior to the retirement of the jury and where the issue was not raised at any appellate level or in the petition for certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="2043.086" offset="8275675">Well, I mean to spend as petitioner's counsel addressed himself most primarily to the first issue on the propriety of the calling Kahns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.391" offset="8308903">I mean to spend most of my time on that, but let me state that we raised this issue for the Court's consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.226" offset="8344325">The Court took this case we took that to mean that this Court wished us to make the review, which we initially suggested be made at an appellate court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.154" offset="8391973">So we endeavored to address ourselves to that issue and provide the Court with a briefing and an argument position and I'm prepared to argue that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.257" offset="8440351">It may be helpful to state briefly the facts on which we think the issue is raised, the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.672" offset="8470026">The information as stated were brought against the petitioner and the two Kahns charging that each of them all three had engaged in wagering operations with failure to register and pay the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.517" offset="8521435">My opposing counsel has detailed the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.890" offset="8534915">The Kahns were the proprietors of one of the stores that the petitioner was observed to visit each day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.961" offset="8575248">They retained at same counsel and plead guilty, on the morning of the trial as stated the Kahns withdrew their plea of -- did I say guilty -- they withdrew their plea of not guilty and plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.357" offset="8624776">In the opening, the government stated that it would believe that it would offer a husband and wife, who would testify that they had acted as agents in petitioner's wagering operation and would testify to the procedures of that operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.211" offset="8688201">At a bench conference immediately following this opening, petitioner's lawyer stated to the Court, that the Court should keep in mind that the Kahns and I'm quoting “were defendants, entitled not to testify in their own case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.875" offset="8750895">The Court stated that they had pled guilty and the defense counsel, petitioner's defense counsel, stated that he had not intended to wave any constitutional privileges in pleading them guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.237" offset="8804289">The Court then stated that he hadn't seen them on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.584" offset="8817664">If they took the stand, if they made a claim it would ruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.978" offset="8835323">Thereafter as the second witness, the government called Mrs. Khan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.734" offset="8854340">She answered a number questions voluntarily stating that she and her husband were proprietors of Harvey's variety shop in Chelsea, that they knew the petitioner, that they had known him by sight for a couple of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.471" offset="8909302">Thereafter she was asked if she had a business relationship with the petitioner and she stated “Our attorney has advised us not to answer on a plea of the Fifth Amendment,” her attorney of course was also the defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.933" offset="8975130">Thereafter at proceedings outside the hearing of jury, bench conference, the Court ruled that because of her plea of guilty, Mrs. Khan could be questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.992" offset="9023300">She could be asked what she did and she had seen in relation to the defendant, but that she could not be asked questions which might tend to incriminate her of other crimes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2248.445" offset="9097174">The government described in stating why it was calling Mrs. Khan, had described the statements that she had given to the revenue agents, stating -- laying out the direct evidence against the petitioner which she was aware of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.493" offset="9157360">She had been the petitioner's agent in his wagering operation, she and her husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.165" offset="9176064">The Court noted the spot, the defense counsel was in representing the various parties and defense counsel stated and I'm quoting “In pleading her guilty he had not intended that she would cooperate with the government.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.515" offset="9241475">Then the Court as it was pointed out I believe in the questioning by Mr. Justice White, sustained the objection on the ground that the question called for a legal conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.321" offset="9284629">Immediately thereafter on page 8 I believe of the record, the Court ruled that the witness could be asked if she had a relationship with the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.459" offset="9325171">However, the Government did not put that question to Mrs. Kahn, the Government asked several other questions to which she gave answers and then when there was an objection on grounds of materiality of a line of questioning, Mrs. Kahn was excused without claiming the privilege again.</text>

            <text syncTime="2341.971" offset="9471248">I just have one more statement of facts on which this issue is raised that I think is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.727" offset="9494235">Later in the trial, the Government called Mr. Kahn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.865" offset="9506879">He was asked 18 questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.667" offset="9518059">He answered ten questions voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.366" offset="9532792">He claimed the privilege as to eight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.762" offset="9542405">The Court sustained the claim of the privilege as to four questions and ordered him to answer the other four.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.797" offset="9574588">When the privilege was sustained as to two questions in a row, the Government excused the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.674" offset="9602069">Now, Mr. Kahn testified voluntarily and under orders of the Court, Court ruling that he had no valid claim of the privilege, that he ran a store in Chelsea, that he knew the petitioner, that he had dealings with him during the period of the information; that he had accepted wagers in his store, that the petitioner came to his store not everyday and not twice a day, but came to his store several times a week.</text>

            <text syncTime="2624.702" offset="10602141">Mr. Justice Goldberg, we do not think that those questions were -- require a reversal here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2634.363" offset="10640802">We think that there are several points that are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.707" offset="10654177">Prior to the asking of those questions, the witness had answered five questions voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.809" offset="10682598">The six previous questions he had been ordered to answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.631" offset="10697853">So he had proceeded to answer six questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.336" offset="10712691">We believe that in light of the Court's ruling in the case that the witnesses could be asked, what they had done and what they had seen in relation to the petitioner that these questions were within the parameters laid down by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.912" offset="10779042">And that counsel, again I might stress that defense counsel had never asked here for proceedings out of the hearing of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.855" offset="10814777">We think on the top of 23 that the Court perhaps even invited such proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.015" offset="10835466">No question was -- no request was made for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.812" offset="10850617">The government lawyer here, we think the record really -- you can smell it if you read the record that the government lawyer was trying to be careful, not trying to overreach, he was trying to represent the public in placing the case before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.983" offset="10919267">And that these questions, these two questions as you pointed out the witness was then released after the two questions were asked, came within those parameters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.588" offset="10969736">Now the -- I don't think that the government attorney can be taxed with being certain under the circumstances here that the witness would make the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.162" offset="11016025">I might address myself to that for a minute, because this petitioner has not argued here for a broad rule in the oral argument, we think the facts of the case are also important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.312" offset="11072658">Here the Court stated that the government -- that the defense lawyer was in the spot, in representing witnesses and the defendant at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.463" offset="11121246">I think it's particularly appropriate here for the government to have determined whether these witnesses intended to plead the privilege themselves and it really didn't become clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.981" offset="11175267">They continued to give voluntary testimony, so that where there is an advice, the only advice that the government had from the Defense Counsel was that he had advised these witnesses to claim their privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.604" offset="11241827">He did not inform the government that they would claim their privilege or so far as the record shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.394" offset="11268995">He perhaps candidly said, he had advised them to claim their privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.860" offset="11286862">In the background was the plea of guilty to the charges involving the very transactions and the government went into the case relying on the decisions as it read them believing that there was no basis for a claim of a privilege at all.</text>
