            <text syncTime="39.334" offset="260681">The issue in this case is whether an employee with veterans’ preference status can be denied an opportunity to confront and cross-examine his accusers in a proceeding before the Civil Service Commission challenging his removal from federal employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.389" offset="372903">The employing agency, in this case, the Air Force, admitted that the witnesses to petitioner's alleged misconduct were all airmen, on active duty and subject to which military control, yet it refused to produce them before the Civil Service Commission because if the Air Force unilaterally concluded that their testimony would not have aided the petitioner's test.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.619" offset="525876">Now, court below held that the failure of the Air Force to produce these witnesses did not violate petitioner's statutory or procedural rights, one of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.694" offset="586167">The petitioner was a veteran with 16 years government service, was employed as a recreational supervisor at the Air Force Academy.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.178" offset="640084">On March 19, 1959, he was suspended from employment on grounds that he had attempted to make homosexual assaults upon three airmen and it willfully damaged a government type.</text>

            <label>Mr. David I. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="156.219" offset="728273">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.307" offset="732557">Now, two of the attempted assaults were alleged to have occurred while the petitioner was on active duty with the Air Force, approximately a year and two years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.687" offset="782085">The third attempt was alleged to have occurred while he was employed in a civilian capacity at the Air Force Academy.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.090" offset="815731">Now, prior to his removal, the petitioner was notified that he could answer the charges against him personally and in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.764" offset="866408">However, since he had been prohibited the day before from entering the academy grounds on pane of arrest, he did not avail himself of his so-called “opportunity” to answer the charges in person, but did so in writing instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.687" offset="938088">Now he was, after he replied in writing, discharged from his position with the Air Force on April 12, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.750" offset="986363">He then appealed to the Civil Service Commission under Section 14 of Veterans Preference Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.856" offset="1010813">On May 5, 1959, the Tenth Civil Service Region held a hearing to take evidence of petitioner's misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.090" offset="1047698">Now at the outset of the hearing, the petitioner requested the Department of the Air Force for an opportunity to interrogate three airmen, two of them were alleged victims of this homosexual attempts and who were stationed at the Air Force academy but this requests were rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.088" offset="1143724">The Air Force submitted its evidence against the petitioner in affidavit form and while admitting its ability to produce all three airmen, it declined to do so on the grounds at the hearing that the Air Force Academy saw no need for their attendance, it did not consider that they would be able to add anything to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.599" offset="1237765">They later explained this by saying that if they had appeared, the testimony that they would've offer on cross-examination would even been more damaging to the petitioner.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="294.214" stopTime="299.265">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="294.214" offset="1280188">To who is which -- who is the third?</text>
            <text syncTime="296.316" offset="1288652">You told us that two of the witnesses --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_i_shapiro" startTime="299.265" stopTime="619.036">
            <label>Mr. David I. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="299.265" offset="1300459">The third one apparently was an individual who was present there.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.539" offset="1313520">There is some confusion in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.049" offset="1319581">They were actually two of these airmen who were the accusing witnesses that he requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.006" offset="1339434">The third was apparently an individual, another airman who was present during one of the occurrences and I think the government states that fact correctly in its brief with regard to that airman.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.166" offset="1391992">Now, as I said, the Tenth Civil Service Region upheld the refusal of the Air Force to produce the airmen and despite the petitioner's denial of the assaults which included an attack on the credibility of these accusers, the conflicts and evidence according to the Tenth Civil Service Region were resolved in favor of the Air Force and petitioner's removal from the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.766" offset="1526471">The petitioner appealed to the Board of Appeals and Review of the Civil Service Commission which affirmed the regional director's decision on his rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.973" offset="1571297">On June 6, 1960, the petitioner filed the complaint in United States District Court on cross motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.159" offset="1607973">The District Court dismissed the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.943" offset="1619153">On November 9, 1961, the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.145" offset="1639946">Now, we contend that where the issue on a veteran's appeal to the Commission turns in part on the credibility of the witnesses against him and the agency admits command and control of those witnesses, Section 14 of the Veterans Preference Act and the applicable Civil Service regulations do not authorize the agency to refuse to produce such witnesses at the hearing, but to rely in their affidavits instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.354" offset="1768782">Section 14 of the Veterans Preference Act of 1944, although it's modeled on Section 6 in the Lloyd-La Follette Act of 1912, was designed to provide special and additional preferences for war veterans.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.068" offset="1839626">That statute eliminated the Lloyd-La Follette provision making cross-examination of witnesses, trial or a hearing a matter for the discretion of the removing officer and substituted in its place an appeal to the Civil Service Commission with the right to make an appearance either personally or by representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.877" offset="1930846">And here's the provision which was excluded from the Veterans Preference Act and is contained in the Lloyd-La Follette Act, “No examination of witnesses nor any trial or hearing shall be required except in the discretion of the officer directing the removal or suspension.”</text>
            <text syncTime="476.194" offset="2008168">As I say, that was specifically eliminated from the Veterans Preference Act and in its place was substituted the appeal provisions of the Civil Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.792" offset="2050591">Now, the legislative history in the 78th Congress is virtually silent as to the meaning of Section 14 appeal provision, but the legislative history of that provision in both the 75th and 76th Congresses demonstrates, we think, that it was designed to provide a trial type hearing on the appeal to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.361" offset="2164799">Legislative representative of the veterans of foreign wars testified in 1937 and pretty much the same way again in 1939 that, “The purpose of that Section referring to what became Section 14 as apparent is to prevent any man from being let out without good cause shown and he would be let out only after a proper hearing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="542.202" offset="2272214">It would protect veteran from being discharged for shall I say personal reasons and on the other hand it will not absolutely prohibit a supervisory officer from discharging a man for cause, but it does give the veteran an opportunity to defend himself by trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.080" offset="2343685">Now Your Honors, almost immediately after 14 of the Veterans Preference Act was enacted, the Civil Service Commission adopted regulations governing employee appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.229" offset="2404289">These regulations, which are substantially the same now as when the first issued, provide pretty much as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.004" offset="2435427">First, the employee has a right to appear at the hearing on his appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.260" offset="2464371">The agency has a right to participate in such hearing and both parties shall have the right to produce witnesses, that's 22601.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.828" offset="2502719">Two, opportunity will be afforded for the introduction of evidence, including testimony and statements by the employee and witnesses and by representatives of the agency and its witnesses and for the cross-examination of witness, that's 22603.</text>

            <label>Mr. David I. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="621.510" offset="2589445">Yes sir, they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.001" offset="2599372">Third, the testimony at hearing shall be uninterrupted.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.234" offset="2616299">Now the court below following its earlier decision in the Luévano against Campbell concluded despite these regulations that in as much as 22607 of the Commission's regulations provided that the Commission is not authorized to subpoena witnesses and that the employee and the agency must make their own arrangements for the appearance of witnesses, the failure of the Air Force to produce its witnesses at the hearing in no way violated the petitioner's rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.543" offset="2757569">Now, we say that this interpretation of 22607 is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.805" offset="2778572">We say that that section has to be read together with 22601 which provides that both the employee and the agency shall have the right to participate in a hearing and that both parties shall have the right to produce witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.995" offset="2843355">When so read, we say that 22607 means that since the Commission is not authorized to subpoena witnesses, the employee and the agency must make their own arrangements for the appearance of their own witnesses because otherwise, the regulations providing for cross-examination of witnesses and requiring that the testimony at the hearing should be under oath would be rendered meaningless and as a matter of fact, since the Luévano against Campbell they have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.187" offset="2972087">Now, the government argues, first, that the Commission has always interpreted its regulations to mean that the employee has the burden of persuading the agency's witnesses to appear and testify against him first before being able and able under the regulations or entitled to cross-examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.985" offset="3067277">And second, that Congress by reenacting the Veterans Preference Act in 1947 implicitly accepted and ratified this so-called interpretation and if the Court please, the only thing that Congress had before it in 1947 was the Commission's regulations and it was these regulations, the ones I've just quoted here, not the Commission's unreported administrative practice under them which Congress in 1947 implicitly accepted and ratified.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.696" offset="3242193">Because in fact, the Commission's interpretation which the government can -- for which the government contends was an unknown prior to the 1952 decision in the Luévano against Campbell, which this Court declined to review on certiorari and which we say was wrongly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.791" offset="3330487">The Luévano rule makes Veterans appeal hearings before the Commission where both parties are granted the right under these regulations to produce witnesses, to introduce evidence, to cross-examine witnesses in a hearings where the employee submits his evidence by testifying under oath and subjecting himself to cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.594" offset="3437798">And the Government submits its witnesses by submitting affidavits and you cannot cross-examine an affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.779" offset="3466533">Now, in practical effect, what has happened is that the employee's right of cross-examination specifically provided for in 22603 has been read out of the regulations entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.564" offset="3513657">I say employee has his right of cross-examination, but the government still retains its right of cross-examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="899.419" offset="3701008">Now, the government suggests that this problem that we have here need never have come about and that in fact the witnesses might have appeared at the hearing if petitioner had only taken the trouble to ask them to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.162" offset="3780002">But this suggestion ignores Air Force regulation 110-5 which precludes the voluntary appearance of Air Force personnel at such hearings absent prior consent from the Air Force.</text>

            <text syncTime="1068.601" offset="4377788">Petitioner was a civilian employee of the Air Force employed as a recreation supervisor at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.345" offset="4416763">He was removed after proceedings before the Air Force and on appeal before the Civil Service Commission, proceedings which upheld the charges that he had committed homosexual assaults on three named airmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.808" offset="4478621">These charges which are set forth at pages 16 and 17 of the record provided petitioner with the names, dates, and places of the alleged assaults.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.683" offset="4530134">The subjects of the assaults, the accusers were known to the petitioner, but he did not call them to the hearings nor did the Air Force call them, the record consisted of affidavits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.823" offset="4590634">The issues in the Government's view here is not whether an employee can be denied an opportunity to confront and cross-examine his accusers for we believe there was no such denial here rather we believe the issue is whether a government employee under the Veterans Preference Act and the regulations must make his own arrangements for the appearance of witnesses whom he may wish to examine or cross-examine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.052" offset="4715604">We believe the regulations are clear, that this obligation was placed on the employee and more so had he done so that he would've been afforded his full rights of examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.230" offset="4772342">We do not believe there is any basis in this record for a contention that the witnesses would not have agreed to appear or that the Air Force would've precluded their appearance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1220.149" offset="4983933">Mrs. Dillon responded that the -- that two of the men were stationed at the Academy, Colorado Springs which was some 68 miles from the location of the hearing and that the Air Force saw no need for their presence and did not believe that they would be able to add anything and had not called them as its witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.710" offset="5074213">We believe that this request here was a request that the Air Force produce these men as its affirmative case witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1257.705" offset="5134190">Further, a review of the contentions before the Board of Appeals and Review, I believe indicates that that is petitioner's contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.640" offset="5173896">Moreover, in a later response in the Board of Appeals and Review proceedings, the Air Force representative, the personnel officer stated that there was, and I'm quoting from page 85 of the record, “that there was no design or intent upon -- on the part of any official of the Air Force to preclude Mr. Williams from such opportunity” that is the cross-examination or having the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.213" offset="5300224">As I will indicate in the moment, the regulations are clear that each side is to make arrangements for its witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.451" offset="5341184">These regulations are set forth in the appendix of the government's brief and the Air Force was proceeding on that basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.317" offset="5484648">I refer to the regulations which are in the appendix to the petition for certiorari, regulation 804.403, that is in the 32 C.F.R., Air Force Regulations which states that it is the policy of the Department of the Air Force to make official information available for use in litigation and to permit military and civilian personnel to testify concerning such information in its files if material and relevant to litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.421" offset="5621008">And that had the petitioner and his lawyer only addressed their request to these witnesses or a request to the Staff Judge Advocate who was located on the Air Force Academy grounds that in accordance for these regulations, the witnesses we have no way of knowing whether they would have agreed or disagreed, the individuals, but the Air Force would've permitted them to testify and I think in accordance with its policy would've encouraged them to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1415.967" offset="5767189">Well, might I respond to that in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.355" offset="5780773">First, counsel for Mr. Williams here has cited the regulation 05.3 and advised me yesterday that he would do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.093" offset="5839705">In reviewing that regulation, I find that it does not apply to members of the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.068" offset="5867604">Members of the military are excluded from that power of the Commission by a just immediately prior regulation 01.1 which states that the rules in this sub-chapter apply to all positions in the competitive service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.353" offset="5940746">So that I cannot respond to your question by saying that the Commission could have ordered their appearance under 05.3 because it does not have that power over members of the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.367" offset="5996857">Whether the -- a request then to the examiner, Civil Service Examiner should have brought forth an order then whatever power it had that they appear, I'm not sure how it would develop since it's -- since none of these steps were taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.605" offset="6093824">But certainly, had the witnesses refused to appear, had the attorney for Mr. Williams contacted the Air Force and asked the Air Force to urge them to appear, had he asked the examiner, none of these he did, had he asked the examiner to order the witnesses to appear, had he asked the examiner to strike the affidavit, if they did not appear, any one of those steps were open to this petitioner and he and his counsel did not take it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1607.467" offset="6533204">I don't believe that he was contending that the Air Force was there refusing a request for him to call them as his witnesses by him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.399" offset="9384939">This is the middle paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.862" offset="9398836">At this time, Mr. Andrews who's the counsel for petitioner before the Commission again made a point of the fact that Airmen, Ryan and Tyler are assigned to duty at the Air Force Academy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.911" offset="9447006">They even know their presence had been requested at the hearing for cross-examination, the Air Force had failed to produce them as witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.844" offset="9478771">Counsel for the appellant contended that the refusal to produce these airmen as witnesses was arbitrary in the best methods of full supply and error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.051" offset="9511581">Again on page 48, second paragraph, at the conclusion of Mrs. Dillon's remarks on behalf of the Department of the Air Force counsel for the appellants initiated the summation of the case by again pointing out “that there's been no opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses on whose statements the removal action have been taken and under the circumstances, the motives of these witnesses were unknown.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.213" offset="9624221">I believe that should put to rest the question for the contention that there has been no request to the Air Force that these witnesses be produced for cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.254" offset="9668420">It was the two affidavits by two of the accusing witnesses who were in fact Air Force military policemen upon which the removal was sustained and it was these witnesses whom counsel for the petitioner asked the Air Force to produce at the hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2439.978" offset="9863293">He -- Mr. Andrew stated that in other words, the request which the appellant made for the appearance Ryan, Stevens and Tyler was rejected to which Mrs. Dillon required lineup affirmative and then he goes on to say that he wants them for cross-examination and he's referring back to that same request on 47 and again on 48.</text>
