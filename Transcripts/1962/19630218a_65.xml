            <text syncTime="14.777" offset="162461">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.540" offset="169566">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.408" offset="180955">My name is Henry Rolph.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.689" offset="194121">I'm here representing the petitioner, Weyerhaeuser Steamship Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.283" offset="220453">This case is a proceeding in admiralty and as an outgrowth of an action which was commenced in the United States District Court of the Northern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.436" offset="273115">It developed from a mutual fault collision between two vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.570" offset="297671">One vessel, the F.E. Weyerhaeuser owned by Weyerhaeuser Steamship Company and the other vessel, United States Army Dredge Pacific operated by the Corps of Engineers of the United States Army.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.738" offset="350333">The collision occurred on September 8, 1955 in the area near Coos Bay, Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.011" offset="387427">The Weyerhaeuser was proceeding outbound from Coos Bay and the Dredge Pacific was on a opposing course and they both -- collision -- vessels came into collision.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.766" offset="438418">Negotiations were conducted to attempt to explore the possibility of a settlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.485" offset="461302">A settlement was impossible and the case was tried before Honorable Michael J. Roach in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.689" offset="506128">At the conclusion of the trial, the Court held that both vessels were at fault and entered a decree dividing the damages pursuant to the historic admiralty rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.908" offset="559000">However, prior to the commencement of the action on the principal collision litigation, a suit had been filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington by one Reynold E. Ostrom who was a seaman employee of the United States employed on the U.S. Army Dredge Pacific.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.677" offset="670072">He had received compensation from the Government in a minor amount, to be exact of $329.01.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.566" offset="709674">He was precluded under the terms of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act from proceeding directly against the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.492" offset="741334">He commenced his action against Weyerhaeuser Steamship Company in the State of Washington and that action was held up pending the decision on the principal collision action.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.190" offset="796087">At the conclusion of the collision action, a special hearing was held before the U.S. District Judge, Judge Roach on whether or not damages paid to Mr. Ostrom by Weyerhaeuser were includable in the overall damages resulting from the collision.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.623" offset="881873">Now, in this connection, the suit filed by Ostrom, the government employee against Weyerhaeuser had been compromised for an agreed payment of $16,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.635" offset="937880">The Government agreed that the amount of the settlement was reasonable but did not stipulate or agreed to the fact that it should be included in the overall damages resulting from the collision.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.825" offset="986676">So that at the conclusion of the District Court case, the case was concluded for all practical purposes with the exception of this one item of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.613" offset="1033801">Now, this is an extremely important point because -- as it -- it comes up in a case where the figures are relatively small but I think that it's incumbent upon me to present to the Court the overall importance of what is involved here because if this doctrine which was ultimately determined to be the doctrine of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals in this case should be permitted to be the law of the country, then and in that event, you'll have a situation where a private vessel comes into collision with a government vessel and should -- if there is a substantial loss of life or great personal injury as there was in the collision between the United States Navy Hospital Ship, Benevolence and the private vessel, Mary Luckenbach where 15 Government employees were killed and 85 were seriously injured, you have a tremendous potential liability against the private vessel under the doctrine as concluded by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.690" offset="1326164">Now, to back up a minute on the history of the case, Judge Roach held that the $16,000 item of damages was merely another item of damages and was to be included in the overall damages resulting from the collision and applying the admiralty rule, it would be divided by two.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.867" offset="1418846">Now, the Government protested that.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.497" offset="1425324">They requested a rehearing on the subject before Judge Roach.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.936" offset="1443088">The rehearing in the District Court was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.766" offset="1458448">The matter was then appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals by the Government and the case was heard before the Ninth Circuit and an order was entered ruling that the Federal Employees' Compensation Act was paramount and that the payments which the Government made pursuant to the Compensation Act were exclu -- the exclusive limit of their liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.670" offset="1566072">So that we have here before us now for the first time a case where there's an attempt to make an exception to the divided damages rule which has existed since the beginning of time on these admiralty maritime collision cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.301" offset="1644544">Now, it's our argument of course that the --</text>

            <text syncTime="413.427" offset="1757080">Let's assume on the basis of the entry of the decree which was made by Judge Roach at the District Court level that both vessels were held mutually at fault and the divided damages rule apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.421" offset="1813086">The Government has made no contention that there should be an apportionment of damages and that point isn't in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.515" offset="1841403">Now, so much for the factual background of the case, now, it's interesting the way the question is presented to the Court and in comparing the statement of the question, there are some substantial differences between the way we state it, between the way the Government state it in its brief in opposition to our petition for certiorari, and the way the Government now states it.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.292" offset="1956551">Now, we state that what is involved in the case is -- is the historic and established rule of divided damages in mutual fault collisions to be altered for the first time by a federal compensation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.760" offset="2006392">The question as presented in the Government's briefs in opposition to our petitioner for certiorari states it whether the exclusivity provision of the Federal Employee's Compensation Act precludes the petitioner, Weyerhaeuser from covering -- from recovering from the United States when half of its tort liability to a government employee in the mutual fault collision between petitioner's vessel and the government vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="531.118" offset="2227806">And the damages of both vessels are added together and then under the prehistoric moiety rule, they're divided two.</text>

            <text syncTime="791.776" offset="3270510">That's the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.265" offset="3276466">Now, this is basically a question of statutory construction according to the Government's interpretation of the matter and the applicable statute of course is the Federal Employees' Compensation Act which provides that the United States shall pay compensation as herein specified for the disability or death of an employee resulting to personal injury sustained while in the performance of his duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.927" offset="3399032">But no compensation shall be paid if the injury or death is caused by willful misconduct of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.644" offset="3425991">Now, the important part of this, we -- as we consider it is in the interpretation of the statute and that the statute itself restricts the liability here to an employ -- to the liability arising to the employee, his legal representative, spouse, dependent, next to kin and anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.480" offset="3557334">Now, that language is limiting language.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.109" offset="3575829">Now, we think that the wording of the statute is most important and we consider that the wording of the statute shows a clear legislative intent on the part of Congress to restrict the liability as between the employer and his employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.193" offset="3656182">And Section 757 (b) of the Act specifically provides that the liability shall be one to the employee or someone in a relationship to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.184" offset="3704142">Now, the Government on the other hand is taking that language and in doing so, we think is violating the rules of construction which have been established by this Court in cases which we've -- and cited in our brief and takes the language that anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages from the United States would include some third person unrelated to the employee-employer relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.475" offset="3805288">Now, the specific categories in the statute are the employee, his relatives and his dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.632" offset="3829948">And the Government is attempting here to apply the general words, anyone otherwise entitled to recover damages to a person seeking to recover after mutual fault collision which is obviously a matter unconnected with the employer's relationship with his workers and their families.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.658" offset="3902046">Now, when we stop and think of the purpose of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, we can see that there was obviously no intention by Congress that this should apply to a third person because the purpose of the Employees' Compensation Act as set forth in the legislative discussion in our brief and in appendix to it was to give to the employee an assured recovery and in return as part of the quid pro quo, the Government was to have a limitation of liability and it was -- and the scheme was of -- the Compensation Act were adopted for this very purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.998" offset="4079365">And it would be quite inappropriate to hold that a third party vessel owner which had no relationship to the employee-employer relationship and was not involved in the quid pro quo exchange should be called upon to bear the entire front of the damages resulting from the collision to which the government vessel had been equally responsible through its negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.056" offset="4195558">Now, further we wished to point out that in the Act, the word a direct is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.980" offset="4219277">Direct modifying judicial proceedings in Section 757 (b) of the Act and this obviously is not a direct legal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.653" offset="4265984">What we have here is an action which arose out of the collision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.434" offset="4281135">The collision was -- action was commenced between the employee and Weyerhaeuser Steamship Company and totally unrelated to him in the State of Washington and the principal action was an action for collision damages between the Weyerhaeuser Steamship Company and the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.894" offset="4362951">So, obviously what we have before us on a basis of the construction of the statute is not a direct proceeding as the term that's meant in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.729" offset="4414255">Now, furthermore we think from a standpoint of determining the intention of Congress in this statute, the proceedings with reference to the 1949 Amendments to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act are quite enlightening and we think indicative of the fact that Congress intend --</text>

            <text syncTime="1238.164" offset="5056031">Now, coming up to the point of the 1949 Amendments to the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, we wish to point out that there was -- that the Court has previously reviewed these amendments in the case of Johansson versus the United States and the legislative history is quite well-defined there but we do wish to make this comment that there was -- in the original draft, when the bill was before the House, there was very general language that the remedy would be afforded to any person under the Act with respect to his own injury or the death of another individual unless otherwise specifically provided by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.421" offset="5241083">Now, the situation was that it went over to the Senate that in this very general language was revised and then it went a joint conference and the present language which is much more specific was adopted which restricts it to the liability to the United States or its instrumentalities under this Act, thereof with respect to the injury or death of an employee shall be exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.978" offset="5351320">So that they've gone from the general to the specific and therefore we think that the only proper construction of that change is that Congress con -- intended that it was to be an Act which applied exclusively between the employee and the employer and had no bearing on outside third persons, in this case an independent shipowner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.210" offset="5480260">That's quite right Your Honor and we've tried to define what information we could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.528" offset="5501471">In the appendix to our brief, there's a language in the Court between Senator Morris and Senator Lucas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.429" offset="5521115">Senator Lucas was evidently the manager of the Bill in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.993" offset="5543372">And Senator Morris requested that the Bill be amended to provide that it should not apply to the master or seaman of any vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.847" offset="5586735">And thereafter, that amendment was added in but in the case of Johansson versus the United States, it was held that the acts of the master and the seaman where the rights were the same after the legislation as they had been before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.528" offset="5649533">So therefore they were both precluded, both the master and the seaman from maintaining an independent action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.213" offset="5676178">And that's in the case of Johansson versus United States where this Court has previously gone into the legislative history of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.114" offset="5707839">Now, we think further that to permit the Government to be immune from participating in the divided damages resulting from mutual fault collision is in clear violation of the spirit intent of the Public Vessels Act of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.493" offset="5765308">Now, this Court in the case of the Canadian Aviator in 1945 and United States versus Shaw in 1940 have reviewed the provisions of the Public Vessels Act and held that they are fully applicable to the United States and the history of course of the Public Vessels Act is that -- in 1924, in the case of United States versus Shaw, and the case of the Western Maid, Justice Holmes held that unless there was affirmative action by the United States to participate in the litigation, it was immune under the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.777" offset="5914520">Thereafter, quite interestingly and this is most important, Judge Holmes in the case of Thekla decided in 1924 also that the -- if the United States joins in litigation under the -- regardless of whether there's a statute of sovereign immunity or not and this decision of this Court preceded the Public Vessels Act, joins in the litigation arising from a maritime collision as it had in that case by filing either a libel or a cross libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.335" offset="6040743">And the significant point is that here although we file the libel, the United States filed a cross libel seeking affirmative damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.474" offset="6073240">So that even in the absence of the Public Vessels Act, the -- there was a right of the Courts to grant a recovery against the United States where United States had joined in the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.211" offset="6140217">Therefore, basically even before the passage of the Public Vessels Act where the Government did as it did here filed a cross libel and affirmatively joined in the litigation, then it waived it sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.208" offset="6192253">Now, we make an -- we emphasize this because we think that quite inappropriately in the Ninth Circuit Court of Opinions -- Appeal written by Just -- Judge Barnes, he brings in the question of sovereign immunity which we feel has no place in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.603" offset="6253798">But -- and indicates that by the passage of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, there was a withdrawal of the sovereign -- waiver of sovereign immunity originally granted in the Public Vessels Act, and therefore we mention this because we think that to grant any sort of an end road through the Federal Employees' Compensation Act in an indirect way in favor of the Government would in affect -- in effect be reducing the effect of the Public Vessels Act and the effect granted by this Court that where the United States joins in litigation that that is a complete waiver in -- of its sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.507" offset="6409383">And the Court hearing the case can proceed to judge all damages arising in the case and in this case, injuries to those on either vessel, parties on either vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.085" offset="6459747">Now, we think that it's also significant in the consideration of this Court that the Court consider its decisions starting with the Halcyon case and the Ryan case and the Nacirema-Weyerhaeuser case, Crumady versus Fisser and the Waterman versus Dugan &amp; McNamara cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.088" offset="6559744">Now, those cases starting with the Ryan Stevedoring case versus Pan-Atlantic have recognized that even though and in that -- those cases decided under the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act, that even though there's an -- there is an attempt under the Compensation Acts to give an exclusive liability to the employee as against this employer that the third party can recover.</text>

            <text syncTime="1795.201" offset="7284172">Well, in that case Your Honor, the case went off on the ground of contract and it's quite obvious on the cases that have come up since.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.255" offset="7316355">There was a Crumady versus Hendrik Fisser where there was no relationship at all between the shipowner and the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.800" offset="7362539">And then in fact the case there was -- the suit was brought against it or the charterer of the vessel had in fact employed the stevedoring company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1829.692" offset="7422098">And then in the later case of the Waterman versus Dugan &amp; McNamara Company which incidentally we've neglected to cite in our brief, but I'm certain that the Court is well familiar with it, it was held by this Court in the Waterman case that there was -- would still be a right of recovery even though there wasn't an expressed contract where the arrangements for the unloading of the vessel between the stevedoring contactor and the employee were made by a consignee of the cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.897" offset="7550934">And so that the point is, the case still recognizes that there was a contractual relationship and based on this violation of the breach of warranty to perform on a workmanlike manner, there was a right of recovery recognized over in spite of the Longshoreman and Harbor Workers' Act by the shipowner which was called upon to pay the judgment to the individuals steved --</text>

            <text syncTime="1889.668" offset="7662007">Well, that's the effect Mr. Justice Black of the Ryan case and the cases which have followed it, quite obviously that the Federal Longshoreman and Harbor Workers' Act is an exclusive liability provision exactly as this is, but that's between the stevedoring contractor who was the employer and the individual longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.362" offset="7756779">So that under that Act, there is no direct right between the longshoreman and his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.188" offset="7784155">But as result of his going to the shipowner and filing a suit against the shipowner just as was done by Ostrom, the Government employee here, then he would have a right independent of the statute and the Ryan case and the following cases of this Court under the Ryan doctrine have recognized that the shipowner would then have a full right of recovery over for whatever damages he incurred if he was able to establish that there has been a breach of the warranty of indemnity to perform the service of unloading or loading the vessel in the workmanlike manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.815" offset="7926680">So that there is a striking similarity and get -- the Government's position, we think, is utterly inconsistent in the Ryan case and the following cases and this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.117" offset="7979865">And the -- in the Ryan opinion, the Government made -- pointed this out to the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2707.869" offset="10934836">But if the cargo on his own ship filed a cross libel against the other vessel as it did in the Chattahoochee then -- and gained a recovery, then the non-carrying vessel would have the right to apportion those damages to the cargo on the carrying vessel to the damages resulting from the overall collision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3360.258" offset="13544364">In 1955, the S.S. Weyerhaeuser and the Army Dredge Pacific collided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.571" offset="13565680">This action was thereafter brought by petitioner against United States under the Public Vessels Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.029" offset="13587519">On cross libel, the District Court found that the collision occurred through the mutual fault of the two vessels and the damages suffered by each party was stipulated and the only disputed item involved the liability of United States, the contribution to the amount of the settlement with -- which petitioner had made with Reynold Ostrom, the federal employee aboard the Pacific who had suffered the personal injury in the collision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.018" offset="13691486">The District Court ruled that the amount of the settlement was an item of provable damage to which the United States had to contribute in the division of damages and the final degree incorporating that ruling was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.340" offset="13740701">On the appeal of the United States, Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed that decision holding instead that the exclusive liability provisions of Section 7 (b) of the Compensation Act precluded contribution by the United States on account of an injury to one of its employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.797" offset="13810604">It's not very much that we can say about the plain language and the meaning of Section 7 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.653" offset="13837981">To us, its meaning is clear and it prohibits contribution to any tort liability with respect to the injury to a federal employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.809" offset="13870582">Petitioner sees it otherwise but we suggest that the meaning which you must give that language can best be determined from an understanding of the basic policy that Congress wrote into the Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.707" offset="13922200">And I'd like to address myself to that immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.683" offset="13954069">Our argument on that score is in two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.027" offset="13971519">The first part of which seems to us strong and clear; the second of which presents a good deal more difficultly for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.493" offset="14005373">The first part of the argument is devoted to the question whether the liability of United States to pay compensation under the Act can be increased because of the inclusion in the Act of the employee's right to sue third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.029" offset="14063470">We'll show first as to that that the liability of United States when it alone is negligent was very carefully regulated by the Congress, and involves the balance of competing interest which lies at the heart of every Workmen's Compensation Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3534.597" offset="14241729">We will then show from the history of the reimbursement provisions of Compensation Act that first they were not intended to affect these more basic rights of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.227" offset="14288332">And second, that the employee's right to recover any amount in excess of the statutory compensation was viewed as being less important to the compensation scheme than the right of the United States to be reimbursed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.520" offset="14353429">Our conclusion from this will be that the right to sue third parties cannot result in increasing beyond the statutory terms, the liability of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.859" offset="14398777">In short, United States owes no more when it and another are at fault then it owes when it is solely at fault with respect to an injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.647" offset="14441932">The second major part of our argument will attempt to answer the questions whether the United States gets off scot-free so to speak when it shares its mutual fault or whether it must first -- it must instead contribute to the extent of its statutory liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.340" offset="14504730">In effect, the Bacille case situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.033" offset="14523538">We start with this where Congress started when it said about in 1915 and 1916 on the hearings to consider what could be done to improve the plight of the disabled federal employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.867" offset="14570872">It was well known then that Workmen's Compensation Acts are designed to serve two basic purposes.One is to provide for employees a sure remedy which is both expeditious, and independent of proof of fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.690" offset="14642134">The other is to provide for employers a liability which, though absolute in terms of fault, is limited and determinant free in a word from the hazards -- the former hazards of large tort verdicts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.504" offset="14697409">These two purposes were Congress' purposes in 1916 when in passing the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, it chose to follow the pattern established by the best there could then be found in the various state acts and particularly had it on that in New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.256" offset="14768358">The legislative history testifies overwhelmingly to the existence of both these major purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.760" offset="14794376">Proponents of the measure were intent on providing federal employees a swift, economical, and assured compensation for injury arising out of employment regardless of the negligence of the employee or that of his fellow servants, and regardless of the lack of fault of the United -- on the part of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.744" offset="14870340">And in exchange for this assumption of liability without fault that was reserved to the United States, a limitation as to the types and amounts of damages recoverable for employment connected injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.052" offset="14923630">It's of interest to note that at the time that the yielding of sovereign immunity then to this limited extent occurred at the time when the United States unlike most employers who were then covered under Compensation Acts was immune from any tort liability to its employees at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.308" offset="15000639">We have recited at pages 13 and 14 of our brief some statements from the debate which point out the terms of this hard fought bargain for compromise for employees, a measured long-range system of assured compensation for the United States, an absolute but limited liability, both of them available regardless of fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.457" offset="15093217">This is the same compromise that exists at the heart of every Workmen's Compensation Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3989.358" offset="16060792">It's clear from the legislative history of the Act that Congress' primary concern was the definition of the change, rights and liabilities of the United States and its employees which were brought about by the elimination of fault as a consideration between them and compensation for injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.713" offset="16134248">The primary result, we know, was swift in certain compensation for the employee, limited though absolute liability for the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.503" offset="16169357">It's also clear that the retention of the employee's right to sue a third party was a relatively incidental matter to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.362" offset="16204779">When Congress provided the carefully regulated compensation scheme, it effectively decided that this was far more important and beneficial to the employee than the illusory right to seek a large tort verdict from the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.442" offset="16265174">At the same time, there was no reason to allow a third party to benefit from these arrangements to which he was a stranger, hence there was opposition expressed to the retention of the employee's right to sue a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="4055.367" offset="16324838">But as we've seen in the reimbursement provisions, the real limit of Congress' concern in dealing with a third party was to ensure that any recovery would be applied to the credit of the United States against its payment of either past or future compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.624" offset="16401847">We conclude from this that since Congress, through the reimbursement provisions has prevented the employee from enjoying any tort recovery until the United States has first recovered it's compensation payment, its statutory liability, that it follows quite naturally --</text>

            <text syncTime="4137.180" offset="16652100">So we'll just start you off as though there hadn't been any -- and there was an absolute prohibition against liability to an employee.”</text>

            <text syncTime="4240.737" offset="17066297">One final note on this, the basic policy of Congress has placed in the compensation scheme generally and in the reimbursement provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.298" offset="17116557">As we've noticed, the reimbursement provisions permit the United States after an assignment to the -- of the employees' claim to bring the suit against a third party on behalf of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4264.160" offset="17160025">Now, contributions were allowable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.416" offset="17169011">This places the United States in the awkward position of suing for a judgment half of which would be executable against itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.945" offset="17203179">This is an odd procedure to say the least and you think that had this kind of procedure has been in the contemplation of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.219" offset="17240273">You'd expect to find something about it in the reimbursement provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.058" offset="17255633">It's not there and we think it's significant that it means that Congress didn't contemplate this kind of arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.779" offset="17282487">That the United States was to be free of tort liability in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.826" offset="17306728">Now, to this point, we have no difficulty with the argument that no liability in excess of the amount of statutory liability should be visited upon the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.111" offset="17351868">We must admit, however, that a more difficult question is presented, that the petitioner's thrust is directed at only the amount that is the statutory liability of the United States under the Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.814" offset="17422608">We're faced as petitioner reminds us with the availability to him in other circumstances of a case law rule of contribution, the moiety rule, divided damages rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.969" offset="17467225">And we've tried to asses whether there can be any accommodation among the relationships of the third party, the employee and United States, which wouldn't disturb the more fundamental purposes of the Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4355.615" offset="17525844">We've -- we have found only three reconciliations and while we have stated them at some detail in our brief, I'd like merely to mention them summarily and give the reason why they seemed to us to be inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.769" offset="17578402">First, you -- the Congress could have cut off the employee's right of action against a negligent third party or could have limited that right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.729" offset="17614242">It didn't and for two reasons, we believe this alternative as a judicial compromise is unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4384.755" offset="17642350">For one thing, Congress didn't make explicit provisions for such a lawsuit and the employee is entitled to have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4391.990" offset="17671293">It even made provisions for -- how the recovery should be distributed in very explicit term and would be most difficult to fashion the rule which would limit the employee's right around these restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.794" offset="17722598">Second, such an alternative would interfere with the well-established right of an innocent third party to recover his full damages from either of two wrongdoers through whose fault this injury occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.281" offset="17780485">The risks and burdens of obtaining contribution have always been placed by Courts on the wrongdoer who is sued so the employee shouldn't be put to that verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="4431.585" offset="17829700">The second possible reconciliation of these competing interest is to hold the United States liable for contribution but only to the extent of a statutory liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="4442.820" offset="17874631">This is the alternative -- it once adopted by the Third Circuit in construing the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act provisions, which are in this respect virtually identical to those of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act, in the Bacille case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4457.208" offset="17932204">Now, there are many difficulties we think presented by this approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.126" offset="17947878">First of all, neither the Longshoremen's Act nor the Federal Employees' Compensation Act contains any authority and written into the statute for such a tort based compromise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4472.542" offset="17993540">Each one provides that the liability under that Act is the exclusive liability and if those words mean anything, there is no rational way to convert a tort liability for contribution or divided damages of admiralty into a liability arising under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.380" offset="18068877">These are two different arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4494.795" offset="18082565">And second, the reimbursement provisions of both these Compensation Acts also stand in the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.386" offset="18108897">And in Pope &amp; Talbot v. Hawn, we cite this case in our brief at page 22.</text>
            <text syncTime="4511.311" offset="18148603">This Court faced the contention of a third party that it and not the negligent employer should have the benefit of a reduction in liability equivalent to the statutory liability of the Employer under the Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4526.988" offset="18211297">In rejecting this contention, the Court pointed to the specific provisions for reimbursement in the Longshoremen's Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.977" offset="18243271">It noted that the contention and I'm quoting, “If accepted would frustrate this purpose to protect employers who are subjected to absolute liability by the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4547.408" offset="18293008">And the Court stated that the contention was a substantial equivalent of contribution which it had declined to require in the Halcyon cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4558.100" offset="18335744">And finally as to the second alternative of permitting contribution but only to the limit of United States' liability under the Act, we've noted in our brief a number of practical difficulties that suggest that the adoption of this alternative would probably raise a good many more problems than it would solve.</text>
            <text syncTime="4576.365" offset="18408782">The difficulty arises essentially from the fact that Congress made the welfare of federal employees a continuing Government responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4585.239" offset="18444309">And you can't discharge that responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.225" offset="18452250">The United States cannot effectively by the commutation of future benefits, which is a practice which by implications from Section 14 of the Act is probably not available anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.785" offset="18510555">Section 14 is a brief section, captioned lump sum settlements and which states the terms under which the Bureau of Employees' Compensation is authorized to make lump sum settlements typically where the amounts don't exceed in this $25 a month or beneficiaries about to leave the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4625.784" offset="18606477">But a very limited range of circumstances and it was certainly not within congressional contemplation that the commutation -- the current value of these long range payments to support families of the disabled employee were to be few in this fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4645.900" offset="18686934">These practical problems are intensified by the normal reluctance of courts of admiralty to enter decrees which might be suitable for this kind of long-range administration of the payment of compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.632" offset="18741896">We certainly have found no practicable way to permit contribution to this limited extent and to insure at the same time that ultimately the United States won't be made to pay something more than its share of the liability that all arises we think as the result of fact that we do have the responsibility to pay compensation whenever it is required and that means whenever dis -- until disability ceases to persist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4690.482" offset="18865298">And in the event that death occurs by natural consequence from the injury after a long term, we then have to continue compensation payments to widows or dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.057" offset="18919633">It's very difficult to bring all these short range into a precise amount of money payable now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4711.409" offset="18948995">The third and last alternative which is that of requiring the negligent third party like petitioner to bear the entire burden of the damages which resulted from the injury is the only one which is totally consistent with the fundamental purposes of the -- of purposes and the language of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act in this Court's decision, decision by Pope &amp; Talbot v. Hawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="4739.072" offset="19059649">Now, we have set out at pages 25 to 30 of our brief, the cases from five Courts of Appeals which have construed the exclusive liability provision of Section 7 (b) or the equivalent in the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act, Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="4755.430" offset="19125060">Each of these cases involves a suit by a third party against the compensation paying employer where the third party claims that he doesn't stand in the shoes of the employee, the representative next to kin and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4769.293" offset="19180544">The uniform holdings of these Courts are that the third party suit is barred, barred by the plain meaning of the language of these sections and the fundamental purposes of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4781.682" offset="19230072">Petitioner has referred us to no appellate decisions to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4785.829" offset="19246686">We have found none.</text>
            <text syncTime="4787.764" offset="19254418">There's nothing I wish to add to the treatment of those cases as they are handled in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4794.509" offset="19281377">Now, as to the indemnity cases, we think the reliance petitioner places on those is misplaced essentially for the reason that they defend for their result on the contractual right of indemnity.</text>

            <text syncTime="5474.225" offset="22000306">But in 1916, Congress which had the power to interfere with them did interfere with them.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>

            <text syncTime="5683.365" offset="22836851">Mr. Chief Justice, I'll be very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5687.296" offset="22852524">I just wanted to call to the Court's attention the two recent cases decided by this Court which further go on -- defined the Ryan case and makes the account warranty indemnity theory to be a very thin one and we did not cite them in our brief, that's Waterman Steamship Corporation versus Dugan &amp; McNamara decided in 1960 and Atlantic &amp; Gulf Stevedores versus Ellerman Lines decided April 2, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="5727.270" offset="23012498">The only comment which I would like to make in reply to Government's argument is that he tempts to -- attempted to minimize the importance of these third party actions and that it wasn't Congress' intent to consider them because they were relatively unimportant but they're tremendously important and that's illustrated by the whole series of cases of this Court starting with the Ryan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5757.675" offset="23134124">And they're tremendously important if the Court will think of the factual situations that can be involved with this doctrine as set forth in the Ninth Circuit's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5768.226" offset="23176234">And this case is permitted to stand where the private shipowner coming in to a mutual fault collision with a government vessel will be required to absorb all of the damages above the compensatory payments accruing on the government vessel and they could be a very tremendous amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.582" offset="23261706">So that the matter can't be just brushed with -- brushed off on the basis that these third party actions weren't -- aren't important and therefore they weren't considered by Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="5802.489" offset="23313324">Mr. Rolph, what was the argument in the -- in the -- the accruing of the damages in the rule?</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry R. Rolph</label>
            <text syncTime="5812.147" offset="23351986">Well, it's historic doctrine, it goes way back and the purpose of it was to prevent the injustices that would accrue if the straight rule of contributory negligence were applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5827.986" offset="23415306">For this reason Mr. Justice White, to take by way of illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5834.128" offset="23439862">One vessel is damaged very extensively and we will say for the purposes of illustration, she suffered damaged of $2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="5843.004" offset="23475388">We would say that the other vessel which came in to collision with her suffered no damages at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5849.298" offset="23500570">But she was equally at fault and in violation of the duty to refrain from negligence as far -- in her navigation as far as that vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="5859.518" offset="23541426">Well, if you apply to contributory negligence rule as we have it in common law, the vessel sought having sustained all the damages but equally at fault would be in a very weak position and it could cause a bankruptcy or insolvency of that shipowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5879.759" offset="23622405">So through the years and it goes back to -- really, I think to the days in England when they first -- they were trying to encourage people to invest in ocean shipping.</text>

            <text syncTime="5914.288" offset="23760541">Well, subsequently after the adoption by this Court of the mutual fault doctrine of divided damages and later on in history, the British courts evolved a system of apportionment of damages based on degrees of fault.</text>
            <text syncTime="5935.422" offset="23845073">And that was never accepted in this country although arguments were made along that line in the case of the Chattahoochee and the doctrine was rejected in the Chattahoochee.</text>
