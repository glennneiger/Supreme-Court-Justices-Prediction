            <text syncTime="24.823" offset="202689">The precise issue in this case is whether or not a longshoreman may sue a vessel in rem, where the vessel is not owned by his employer, but where it is bareboat charted by the employer and where the injury was caused by an unseaworthy condition created by the or during the tenure of the bareboat charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.061" offset="287640">Briefly Waterman Steamship Company owned this vessel the Yaka, and bareboat charted it to Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.832" offset="318673">Pan-Atlantic also does stevedoring operations, and while the vessel was in the Port of Philadelphia in the course of the unloading operation, Pan-Atlantic caused some staging to be brought onboard the vessel pallets, which were defective and this man while working broke through one of the pallets and was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.933" offset="391084">He sued the vessel, the contention here was that he was bound by the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, he sued the vessel in rem.</text>

            <text syncTime="83.922" offset="439045">Yes sir Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.133" offset="443956">He received compensation from the insurer for Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.049" offset="463600">He brought a suit against Waterman as the owner of the vessel, but did not pursue that.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.124" offset="487842">As a matter of fact that was dismissed on a ground that the unseaworthy condition, which is alleged to have caused the accident occurred during the period of the charter so that the owner himself had no control whatsoever over the condition nor had no part in creating the condition or maintaining it.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.229" offset="544266">So that -- and that was not pursued, so that the specific issue, which is here involved is whether or not the Longshoremen can pursue the vessel in rem or whether the Pan-Atlantic as the employer and also bareboat charter precludes this man from pursuing the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.550" offset="613543">There are a number of other side issues, which I would like to develop as we go along sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.992" offset="639352">The District Court held that the vessel was unseaworthy and he charged the vessel itself with liability apart from any liability of Waterman or of the Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.419" offset="697031">He held that the Compensation Act did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.267" offset="712391">He also did not apply the doctrine of the Smith versus Mormacdale case about which I will say considerably more in a moment or two, in which case the Court -- for the Circuit Court of Appeals held that where the owner himself was also the employer, then the Longshoremen could not pursue the vessel, because in effect he would suing the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.617" offset="809880">In the Smith versus Mormacdale case that was the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.329" offset="824717">Here, it was one big step further on where it was not the owner who was the employer, it was a bareboat charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.230" offset="852302">So that Judge Clary speaking for the District Court held that bareboat charter was not an owner and therefore he was not exempt or rather he meant, it was not barred by the Compensation Act, he could proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.863" offset="894830">He also held that there was indemnity over from Pan-Atlantic to the Waterman Steamship Corporation for the -- rather to the vessel for the injury and for the damage caused by the injury, since Pan-Atlantic was responsible for the accident, for the unseaworthiness itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.663" offset="962017">The Court of Appeals reversed --</text>

            <label>Mr. Abraham E. Freedman</label>
            <text syncTime="230.511" offset="1025442">Ultimately yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.566" offset="1033592">As between -- there was a contract of indemnity between Pan-Atlantic and Waterman so that Pan-Atlantic would be responsible ultimately, under its contract between these two.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.303" offset="1068596">Your Honors will find and I think this Court has said many times that this liability under this contract for indemnity does not affect the rights of third parties particularly in this kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.739" offset="1110288">That case came specifically before this Court in Pope &amp; Talbot versus Hawn, H-A-W-N, where this Court said that the contract of indemnity cannot take away any rights from the longshoreman, which he may have against the vessel or her owner.</text>

            <text syncTime="270.925" offset="1187088">There was a charter party, which contained a contract of indemnity in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.040" offset="1203493">Although, there are other cases which say that there are five contracts of indemnity to do the vessel -- to do the work properly, to do the work safely.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.736" offset="1234317">So that in any case I would think that there was either an express or implied in this case, the charter party itself contained a contract of indemnity, an expressed contract of indemnity.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="292.285" offset="1272560">In the absence of that contract of indemnity, is there any question about the liability of Waterman?</text>
            <text syncTime="298.561" offset="1297638">Would Waterman would have been liable?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abraham_e_freedman" startTime="300.698" stopTime="894.914">
            <label>Mr. Abraham E. Freedman</label>
            <text syncTime="300.698" offset="1306206">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.924" offset="1315088">Unless Waterman is liable for the torts of the vessel itself, that was a question that's been posed many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.937" offset="1335150">Many cases have said that unless the owner himself where he charters it has some hand in the creation of the unseaworthy condition, he bears no responsibility for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.896" offset="1374960">There are a number of cases that I will mention; Barnstable for one and a number of others would say that the owner time-charter or rather bareboat chartered his vessel has no control over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.415" offset="1409024">He is relieved and the suit itself must proceed in rem against the vessel itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.411" offset="1433057">The Court of Appeals reversed taking the Smith versus Mormac case one step further, whereas in Mormac case, Judge Staley speaking for the majority at that time held that the suit against the owner or suit against the vessel was in essence a suit against the owner and therefore, the Compensation Act barred the claim, that is the claimant in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.635" offset="1533889">The Court of Appeals here reversed on that ground but incorporated a new doctrine into the law, namely that in every rem action there is got to be a accompanying personal liability in personam from other, either from the owner or in a part of the charter or someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.471" offset="1605256">In other words, there's got to be an accompanying personal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.658" offset="1614033">This was something new in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.710" offset="1622183">This was first developed I think in the First Circuit by Judge Aldrich speaking for the First Circuit of Court of Appeals in the Pichirilo case.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.869" offset="1650813">I think that case was argued here sometime ago and a companion case was argued just last week.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.142" offset="1675891">In any event, two Judges dissented from the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.909" offset="1698983">Chief Judge Biggs held that the decision was in violation or in direct conflict with this Court's opinion in The Pinar Del Rio and also in the Sieracki case and Judge Staley concurring in the dissent with Judge Biggs also pointed out that he was the author of the Smith-Mormacdale case and this did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.129" offset="1775888">He dissented also in the ground that the Smith case did not extend beyond the actual owner, did not extend to a charter and no matter what he was, he was not an owner and therefore, he could not claim the protection as an owner against the libel in action in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.115" offset="1855822">Now from almost the beginning of the time in this country, a lien against the vessel has been recognized and has been the basis for an action in rem against the vessel itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.734" offset="1902320">Every action in rem has got to have a lien against it before it can be prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.360" offset="1936802">Perhaps it would serve a purpose; at this point, I would just take a half a moment to outline the difference between this kind of a lien, a maritime lien and an ordinary common law lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.175" offset="1976090">We all know that an ordinary common law lien arises and it's based on the possession of the thing itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.722" offset="1998242">A maritime lien has nothing whatsoever to do with the possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.310" offset="2012662">It is a right in the property itself regardless of whether this possession has nothing to do with it, as soon as in all cases of personal injury to people who are lawfully on board and this Court said that in the very early case of the Stevens, the John G. Stevens than anybody who is lawfully on board and suffers personal injury, a lien arises against the vessel itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.406" offset="2084968">That's a secret lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.779" offset="2090506">It's an inchoate lien and becomes perfected as soon a libel in action, a libel in rem is brought to a conclusion, to consummation.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.504" offset="2121435">So that the distinction between this kind of a case between a libel -- between a lien under the Maritime Law and the Common Law lien, which we generally recognize as possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.609" offset="2161768">At first, the Common Law lien attaches only because of the possession of the thing whereas under the Maritime Law the lien arises because it has the right of property, the thing which gave rise to the course of action as a right in a property itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.787" offset="2218506">This Court said exactly that in the Lotawana in the very early case in 1875, where in considering one of laws of Court in 1858, Rule 12, the Admiralty Laws was amended to wipe out the liens in connection with domestic vessels and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.135" offset="2283917">On the theory that this that the lien, the libel – the lien and the Maritime Law was a procedural device.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.050" offset="2311607">In 1872, that law was amended and the Lotawana -- this Court and the Lotawana construed it and said that actually it is not a procedural device, that is the lien under the maritime law, but it is actual in the words which they use where a property right in the thing itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.386" offset="2380884">And that's the theory, that's the bases which this Court has followed right down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.903" offset="2403035">Now in the early days, tracing the development of this lien, we find it interesting to note from even in the decision by Chief Justice Marshal in connection with an embargo in the Little Charles back in 1880, where he held the connection with an embargo of the vessel itself, they held that the vessel is the personality all by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.021" offset="2487463">And regardless of whether the owner knew what was happening at the time bareboat chartered it or whether he didn't know, didn't make any difference, the vessel itself was liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.483" offset="2525288">Following that, we find an opinion by Justice Story in the The Malek Adhel in 1844, reported in 43 U.S. in connection with an act of piracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.616" offset="2573876">The vessel was taken over by pirates and the vessel was held liable there despite the fact that the owner had no control over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.376" offset="2596864">The vessel itself was the offending thing, the Court there, Justice Story and Justice Marshall both pointed out that while the vessel is to a sense inanimate, yet is not really inanimate, it acts and it acts to the crew, it has a master, it reports to the master and therefore, it was the offending thing itself and therefore it was liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.643" offset="2669902">Following that, we have another series of decisions from this Court in the Barnstable for example, where the vessel was bareboat charted and the Court -- this Court quoted in the opinions of Mr. Justice Story and Mr. Chief Justice Marshall holding that the vessel was in itself by personality and therefore was liable in rem for its own acts apart from any other consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.626" offset="2765928">In the China, this Court reached the same conclusion where a vessel was required to take on a compulsory pilot and the owner there was absolved because, being a compulsory pilot, he couldn't be responsible in personam for the acts of the compulsory pilot.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.005" offset="2819427">However, the Court said that the vessel itself was responsible, because the pilot was an integral part of the vessel, of the crew or the vessel itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.776" offset="2850461">And therefore, even though the owner himself may not have been liable, the vessel itself was in rem, under the basis of the lien theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.138" offset="2895914">Justice Holmes speaking for this Court summarized the situation quite well in his book called “The Common Law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="704.464" offset="2921200">And he again -- in reviewing the all of the authorities pointed out that the vessel is really a living thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.981" offset="2943248">He said it becomes rational when we consider the vessel as an object with the crew, which acts through the master, which acts through the crew and has a separate personality.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.851" offset="2990791">My friends on the other side argued that Justice Holmes was in conflict with a case which he handed down in the Eugene Moran reported in 212 U.S in 1909.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.248" offset="3032377">And they quote some language from Justice Holmes' opinion indicating that perhaps he was critical of the doctrine of the liable in rem of the lien theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.976" offset="3071248">However, my friends didn't go far enough, because had they gone a little further and looked at Justice Holmes' decision at the decision itself, they would have found that the liability was posed on the rem, on the liability of the ships themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.187" offset="3120149">There were four vessels which were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.704" offset="3130180">Had there been in personam liability, as my friends would indicate the owner would have been liable either for his share probably one half along with the liability of someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.742" offset="3166333">Instead of that, Mr. Justice Holmes pointed out that there are four vessels and each vessel was liable for the accident itself or for the collision, each one on so and so it was a separate personality.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.202" offset="3208129">So that in all respects Justice Holmes' opinion is clearly consistent with what he said in “The Common Law” and clearly consistent with the theory that the vessel is a personality and that a liable in rem rely in every case against the vessels apart from any liability of the owner or anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.964" offset="3287228">There are a number of other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.111" offset="3291826">I would like to also point out in passing that my friend cite -- say that the Fourth Circuit has aligned itself with the First Circuit in that you got to have an accompanying liability and they cite for that proposition Noel, N-O-E-L versus Isbrandtsen in an opinion by Judge Sobeloff.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.290" offset="3360580">Actually they are incorrect there too, in that case the vessel was taken out of navigation, the vessel was not in commerce at all, it was being prepared for the mothball fleet.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.522" offset="3397465">So it was out of navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.012" offset="3403421">There was no warranty; this Court held that in the West case.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.148" offset="3415960">And therefore Chief Judge Sobeloff said that there just isn't any liability either for unseaworthiness or negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.674" offset="3446053">There has got to be some liability, he did not say that there has got to be an accompanying liability of some third party in personam as my friends would say.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.357" offset="3476773">Actually he said that in the case there wasn't any evidence of negligence, there wasn't any evidence of unseaworthiness, therefore there was no liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.907" offset="3503000">So that the Fourth Circuit case when read, indicates that it is in complete conformity with the contention which we urge and which the other cases that this Court has handed down indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.715" offset="3550229">This Court said in the Canadian Aviator, speaking to Justice Reed, versus the United States where a vessel, or a merchant vessel following on orders from the Coastguard struck a submerged object and there was a technical question involved and the question whether the United States was liable, because the vessel itself was liable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1272.470" offset="5193226">Where you've got a lien against a vessel, an attachment case there might be mortgages ahead of you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.735" offset="5210363">And in an ordinary attachment case then you might come in last and never get paid anywhere, whereas if you've got a lien against a ship in a priority, you've got a right in this property itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.074" offset="5243695">And this Court has said that these liens for personal injuries even supersede the lien of the mortgage, just as wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.005" offset="5283401">So there actually is a tremendous difference between the requirement of payment from the owner himself and looking to the ship itself for payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.406" offset="5317047">And, as I said with advent of the corporate device now this makes the situation -- it makes it so much more necessary to maintain this rem theory and not to expand it any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.520" offset="5373471">Precisely the same situation came before the Court in Pacific Pie, a District Court case in State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.824" offset="5402624">I cite it because this Court adopted that principle on a Sieracki case in 328 US.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.795" offset="5430523">And there we have the precise situation where the vessel committed the tort and it was sued and the Court there held that it was a third person and this Court cited it with approval in Sieracki.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.978" offset="5495306">This Court also in Monrosa versus the Carbon Black Incorporated, in an opinion by Mr. Justice Brennan where there was a Bill of Lading, this was not a personal injury case, there was a Bill of Lading in which there was a jurisdictional question raised as to where the owner could be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.822" offset="5566673">This Court held that while the jurisdiction of the owner was confined to certain areas, the label in rem could be maintained where it could be before, and so long as the contract itself did not confine the ship in rem to the same jurisdiction, the libellant was free to bring his liable and rem against the ship itself apart from any right that he might have had against the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.369" offset="5656848">Here again and this was a very recent pronouncement of this Court's indication or intonation to maintain as a separate entity, the liability of a ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.672" offset="5706062">I've already discussed the Smith versus The Mormacdale opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.393" offset="5732916">We say that it was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.943" offset="5743156">We think that this Court should reverse it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.749" offset="5750366">However, the particular case that we are concerned with here now, goes even further than Smith versus Mormacdale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.108" offset="5783803">Here in the particular case this Court said that there's got to be an accompanying personal liability on a part of the owner or someone else before there can be a lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.285" offset="5828524">There is no basis in the law for that other than this decision from the First Circuit by Judge Aldrich.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.143" offset="5855901">But it is in conflict with all the decisions which I've recited to Your Honor, none of which require a personal liability, so that the Court of Appeals here went one big step further as Judge Staley pointed out and Judge Staley was the author of the Smith versus Mormacdale opinion, he dissented from the majority on the ground that unless it's the owner himself then the Smith decision, the Smith doctrine doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.878" offset="6026846">I would like to point out before I conclude, I would like to point out some other considerations, some differences between the owner himself, real differences between the owner and what my friends have termed the owner pro hac vice, bareboat charter has been declared or has been used, the label has been put owner pro hac vice, but he is really not an owner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.598" offset="6173759">And I may say too that the charter, the bareboat charter isn't liable for the mortgage, she's subject to the mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.888" offset="6202911">If the owner should default during the period of the mortgage, the vessel could be taken away during the period of this charter, so that it's possession is not complete apart from any, any surrender the vessel by the owner himself and he can't do anything about it as the owner might be able to be do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1573.387" offset="6396949">It seems to me that I would like to take the first few minutes of my time to put this case in little better perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.732" offset="6430281">Following the injury to this man Reed, he first brought an action in personam against Waterman Steamship Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1591.863" offset="6470823">Waterman Steamship Corporation was the owner of the ship upon which he had been working when he was injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.707" offset="6510216">There was a motion by Waterman to dismiss on the ground that the condition which caused injury had arisen after the time that Waterman the owner had transferred possession to my client Pan Atlantic under a demise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.503" offset="6593390">And the opinion was filed by Judge Kirkpatrick which is in this record, ruling on that, and Judge Kirkpatrick said that he -- the District Court said that he could not at that time dismiss because all of the facts were not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.896" offset="6678967">However, he did point out that it was, it's at page 19 that opinion Justice Black, he did point out that it was perfectly clear law that for a condition which arose after the demise there could not be personal liability upon the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.488" offset="6757334">Now the owner would be liable for a condition or an infirmity or a defective existed at the time he leased it to Pan Atlantic, but not for something that Pan Atlantic itself caused during the time it was in possession and control under the demise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.471" offset="6829223">Now, the very day that the suit against Waterman, the in personam action against Waterman was dismissed, the devise of a libel against the ship in rem was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.358" offset="6904769">Now, I think it is important that we note that there has been a judgment and no appeal from that judgment in the in personam action, Reed versus Waterman Steamship Corporation, so that under the usual rule of res judicata that has been determined here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.517" offset="6985435">There is no personal liability of Waterman.</text>

            <text syncTime="1824.990" offset="7403290">As I recall the decision of the Court of Appeals in Pichirilo held, first that there had been a device from out of the owner and therefore that the owner no longer owned and no longer controlled and operated the ship and that the demise had been into the Longshoremen's employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.462" offset="7497226">Now what this Court held in that case if I understand this decision was that the evidence there was not sufficient to show a demise out of owner into employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2501.086" offset="10107695">In other words the common law ever since the decision of this Court in the Barnstable, about 1901 has been that if I take a ship under a demise, I must return it free and clear of liens.</text>

            <text syncTime="2758.281" offset="11136502">And Mr. Justice Black, you cited the language from that decision in your decision in the Continental Grain versus Barge FMB something or other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.846" offset="11182791">You quoted from, and extensively quoted, from this Consumers Import Company versus what I called KKK, a decision written by Mr. Justice Jackson in which you specifically said that a liability such as this was like talking in riddles, how could a person's property be liable when by statue his personal liability had been exempt?</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.530" offset="11317478">Now the question comes up also in this situation, what did Congress mean when it used in Section 905 of Compensation Act the words, I'll get them exactly, “The liability of the employer shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee, otherwise entitled to recover damages from such employer at law or in admiralty on account of such injury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.578" offset="11453733">Now, in the case of the Canadian Aviator which my opponent relies upon, the question came up as to what Congress meant when in the Public Vessels Act it had used the language at law or in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.193" offset="11524159">And in this Court's decision in that case it made it very clear that when Congress used the terms at law or in admiralty it was using in admiralty in the broad generic sense and it didn't simply mean admiral -- liability in a proceeding in admiralty in personam.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.392" offset="11616946">That it meant to include the in rem proceeding in admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.064" offset="11635649">In other words, it was not simply giving you a little bit and then taking the same thing away from you because for this Court say that the Congress has the power and did in fact exempt an employer, the individual from in personam liability, but yet to say that property, which is hit shall be sold as my adversary urges to pay is really a riddle, which this Court has consistently over the years refused to apply in its full vigor of the language, which people urge for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3219.004" offset="12979388">Some argument was made by Mr. Freedman a few moments ago about one ship corporations and mortgages and I must say I'm just unable to follow how that gets into this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.262" offset="13032469">Either you have a Congressional statute which gives an immunity in this situation, and it doesn't matter whether the corporation has one ship or ten and it doesn't matter whether they are mortgaged or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.571" offset="13085654">I just cannot see the relevancy of the argument that was attempted to be made on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.903" offset="13110941">Just in closing, I want to say that in the brief I -- there are a number of instances where Congressional legislation has changed the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.772" offset="13154408">I have in oral argument only referred to the Fire Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.583" offset="13169664">It would for example be so in a limitation of liability proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.097" offset="13191711">The Act there would permit the ship owner to limit the liability of a marine disaster.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.310" offset="13220655">The Act there only speaks in the terms of the in personam liability of the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.354" offset="13248763">Given this situation a collision let's say and the owner goes in and his liability is limited and he has satisfied that liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.381" offset="13296933">The ship is then sold, if my adversary's position be correct, then after that sale or perhaps even without a sale, a separate in rem action can be instituted against the owner's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.647" offset="13366000">This creeps into sovereign immunity cases, as this Court has held in a whole series of decisions, where government vessels were involved during the period of both government ownership and demise to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.213" offset="13436217">Some were returned to their owners at the end of the demise, some were sold and then attempts were made to enforce the in rem liability and this Court struck them down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.306" offset="13484596">This Court has not, I submit, in other than what Mrs. Gilmore and Black referred to is rather [Inaudible] ever sustained the concept that there was a separate in rem liability when liability in personam had been expunged by the statute or otherwise and that should be I think decision of this Court here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3374.323" offset="13600684">If the Court please this Court has already many time stated that even though in personam liability has been expunged so to speak at least in tact a liability in rem and I've said at those cases, I think I made references before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.774" offset="13650422">Mr. Justice Goldberg previously said, is there anything in the Compensation Act which preserves the Right of Action against third persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.952" offset="13675186">Section 33 of the Compensation Act expressly preserve the Longshoreman all Right of Action against all third persons other than the owner, the employer himself, this and libel in rem is a third person.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.616" offset="13725863">This Court in Sieracki adopted the principle, they adopted and endorsed the case of the Pacific Pine where precisely the situation involved an owner's Stevedore and there the Longshoreman was permitted to bring a libel in rem against the employer himself as owner of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.690" offset="13798170">And this case as I said was endorsed by this Court in the Sieracki decision, so that we do have something on record from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.088" offset="13827741">Mr. Justice Black in the Cannella grant case did not do as my friend said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.993" offset="13847385">Mr. Justice Black speaking for the Court pointed out very carefully that he was not destroying the libel in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.113" offset="13871835">He was not destroying the lien at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.953" offset="13879150">All he was doing, if the Court please, made it very clear that the course of action was the same, that the witnesses were the same, and therefore there was everything to be said for transferring both in rem action and in personam action both at the same place where that could be tried at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.019" offset="13943411">And implicit in that opinion is the contention that the in rem action must be preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.161" offset="13963995">Justice Black said in that case that there was a good reason for the rule originally and there was a good reason for it today and the very fact that any transfer of the case under Section 1404 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.226" offset="14012270">So to bring the in rem and in personam action together as I said indicates that this Court attempts to preserve the in rem action and the lien which goes along with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3596.950" offset="14491146">Thereby -- but you could sue the owner in personam, thereby separating the liability of the employer from the liability of the ship.</text>
