            <label>Mr. William I. Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">May it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="3.999" offset="119411">When the Court recessed yesterday afternoon, I had reached that point in the narrative of the case history where Noia had presented his petition for the writ of habeas corpus to the District Court, Judge Cashin.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.104" offset="191822">Judge Cashin expressed a desire to learn if it were possible, exactly why Noia had failed to appeal from the original judgment of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.866" offset="242813">And so a hearing was ordered and held.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.947" offset="255143">And Noia was brought down from the prison and testified in his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.907" offset="278967">And in substance, he testified that he refrained from appealing because he had exhausted his funds and his family's funds, and he didn't want to give further burden on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.037" offset="335496">And he also testified that he did not know that he had the right to apply to the Appellate Division for permission to appeal as a poor person and that upon a showing of merit, the application would be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.548" offset="401533">New York called Mr. Louie Walker, who had been Noia's trial counsel and Mr. Walker testified that he visited Noia in the jail before Noia's commitment to the prison during the 30-day period in which a notice of appeal could be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.531" offset="485543">He told Noia that Caminito and Bonino had or were going to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.052" offset="511561">He suggested to Noia that he should appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.227" offset="528280">He expressed his opinion that upon such an appeal, the chances for reversal were very good and he offered to file a notice of appeal in Noia's behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.773" offset="590451">I asked him why, if he knew, why Noia finally decided not to appeal, and his answer in substance was this; that while they discussed several reasons, the real reason was that Noia did not want to run the risk of a reversal, a new trial, and perhaps a less clement verdict at the hands of a jury and judgment at the hands of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.081" offset="707688">They had been contemporaneously in Brooklyn a case of a defendant named Hull, who had been convicted, who had appealed from a life sentence, who had won a retrial, who had been reconvicted, and who had been executed and the hearing rested in that condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.081" offset="799744">Judge Cashin rendered his decision --</text>

            <label>Mr. William I. Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="229.394" offset="1020949">Well, actually on the appeal by Bonino and Caminito, there were -- there was one or perhaps more errors urged in the ruling of the trial court and the judgment was affirmed on the basis of Section 542 of our Code of Procedure, which, criminal procedure, which authorizes the appellate court to render judgment regardless of any error which does not, in the judgment of the appellate court, affect the substantial rights of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.089" offset="1155741">It may very well be that Mr. Walker's opinion was based on the existence of that error or those errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.723" offset="1190222">And I think Your Honors will realize that where there is an error of law in a record, no lawyer is so gifted with the gift of prophecy that he can tell that the appellate court will say, “This is or it is not a substantial error under Section 542.”</text>
            <text syncTime="291.752" offset="1270366">At the moment, Your Honor, I really don't remember what the error was, and if I may say so, for the purposes of this argument it's not material.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.526" offset="1305475">The point is that an experienced lawyer and the record discloses that Mr. Walker was experienced in the criminal law, told Noia that in his judgment, there was good chance of a reversal.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.532" offset="1413517">Judge Cashin refrained from making any findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.881" offset="1430862">Although, I think when you read the record, you will agree that if it had been necessary, if he had felt it to be necessary to make findings of fact, he would have found that this was the reason for Noia's refraining from appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.764" offset="1494392">That is clear from his opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.122" offset="1743809">That's right and I can only repeat, Your Honor, that I didn't then think and I don't now think that that was an issue relevant to the issue of law before Judge Cashin.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.012" offset="1795427">And as a matter of fact, Judge Cashin refrained from making a finding because as he expressed it in his opinion on the reasoning in the authority cited above and, of course, he had reviewed all of the cases and the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.023" offset="1859480">I feel constrained to dismiss the writ because of relator's failure to exhaust his state court remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.886" offset="1886960">In other words, he decided it purely as a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.699" offset="1906186">He granted Noia a certificate of probable cause and the case came to the Second Circuit, the legal aid was assigned and Mr. Polsky represented the Noia and presented the arguments in his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.849" offset="1974732">And he presented them with a depth of a scholarship and breadth of research and the clarity of expression which I'm sure, Your Honors will immediately know as soon as he addresses this Court and I enjoyed his presentation for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.577" offset="2045680">First, because it was an intellectual treat to listen to him and secondly, because I was wrapped around with the sense of perfect confidence in the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.536" offset="2093537">It seemed to me that the issue, as he presented it, could not be successful because his argument really amounted to this; that Section 2254, when it speaks of the exhaustion of state remedies, means state remedies at that point available to a state defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.073" offset="2183711">Whereas, to me it seemed equally clear, in fact more clear that 2254 because of its history and because of its underlying reason meant that a -- that if ever there had been a state remedy available to a defendant, such as here the remedy of an appeal from the judgment, it had been incumbent upon the defendant to exhaust that remedy and if he failed for any reason, except the interference, let me say, for instance by the state authorities, if he failed to exhaust that remedy, he was irrevocably and forever barred from seeking to end to the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.486" offset="2373360">The issue, I thought, was as simple as that.</text>

            <text syncTime="697.729" offset="2894242">Well, it took 10 months for that court to decide this matter by a divided court with a very vigorous dissenting opinion by Judge Moore.</text>

            <text syncTime="803.495" offset="3317321">Well, I pass now Your Honors to the reasons given by the majority for their decision, and I shall be very brief in my analysis of them for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.339" offset="3368730">First, is that I really don't understand the reasons; and secondly, I don't believe they're material to this issue; and thirdly, and because the majority of the Second Circuit didn't really decide the case on any one of the grounds, which it discussed so fully in this very lengthy opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.956" offset="3467160">For instance; the majority wrote on the question of waiver and it said in substance, that Noia did not or had not waived his right not to be convicted on the basis of a coerced, and therefore illegal, and unconstitutional confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.899" offset="3606967">Well actually, that wasn't the question of waiver that was involved; no defendant ever waives that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.800" offset="3634552">He goes to trial with the right, the protection surrounding him that he shall not be subjected to the use and effect of such a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.466" offset="3685230">The question of waiver that was involved was: Did Noia or had Noia waved his right to appeal from such a judgment?</text>
            <text syncTime="904.402" offset="3720965">And as I read the opinion after having discussed the question of waiver, the majority in effect said that they were not deciding the case on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.771" offset="3794422">Then they passed to the question of exhaustion of state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.700" offset="3814170">Now, it was incumbent upon Noia to convince that court, that Section 2254, when it speaks of the exhaustion of state remedies, means remedies now available to a state defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.342" offset="3896717">That if now there is no remedy, he's entitled to the federal writ and concededly there was no longer any remedy available to Noia in New York because the Court of Appeals through Judge Fuld in the opinion which I have in my brief had said the coram nobis was not available and that there was no such doctrine as abstract natural justice to which he could address himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.166" offset="4020015">And as I read the opinion of the majority, they did not decide the case on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.877" offset="4054915">And then they passed to another point and discussed but did not decide the case on the basis of whether or not there was present and adequate -- an independent and adequate state ground of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.304" offset="4112593">Actually, the opinion of the majority is based on language which Your Honors will find at page 28 of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.047" offset="4179571">And I would like to read because it seems to me that it sums up the reasoning, with great deference to the Court, I think I should say the emotion rather than the reasoning of the Second Circuit which is the basis, the real basis of this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.382" offset="4264939">After having written some 30 pages or so of an opinion raising three different grounds and then veering away from it, the majority wrote, “Thus we come to the last scene in this human drama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.203" offset="4332231">Is there an adequate state ground in this case dooming relator to life imprisonment?</text>

            <text syncTime="1065.647" offset="4365981">The state ground here is inadequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1079.438" offset="4421151">As we noted in the last paragraph for the state ground to be adequate, it must be reasoned and I can best answer that in words of Judge Moore in his dissent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1131.264" offset="4628459">Legal principles having failed to produce the desired result, resort must be had to a tour de force by the fear that”, then he quotes again, “No state ground is entitled to unqualified deference and adequacy in any event is but a term of relativity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.481" offset="4725321">After all for the state ground to be adequate, it must be reasonable and what could be more unreasonable than requiring a defendant to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.798" offset="4778611">And this, Your Honors, is a case in a nutshell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.743" offset="4794389">New York had provided a ground of relief for Noia as it has for every defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.902" offset="4830960">I -- while in those days antedating Griffin against Illinois, the Appellate Division reserved to itself the right to require of an appealing of an indigent defendant that he showed some merit which he does not do today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.760" offset="4910373">I can say to Your Honors, from my experience that in a case involving life imprisonment, it is to me inconceivable that if Noia had made an application for leave to dispense with printing and to appeal as a poor person, that the Appellate Division would have denied that application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.551" offset="4985605">They would have granted it as a matter of cause because of the severity of the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.546" offset="5009533">And therefore, as Judge Moore says, and he says it with his judicial tongue and his judicial cheek, what could be more unreasonable than requiring a defendant to avail himself of a right of appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2261.159" offset="9147956">The trial record shows at the time Noia was sentenced, trial judge had some difficulty in accepting the recommendation of mercy that the jury made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.863" offset="9190797">He said to Noia on the day of sentence, “In substance, I find it very difficult to accept this mercy recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.427" offset="9225070">You've been before me on three separate occasions of robbery.</text>

            <text syncTime="2302.609" offset="9313782">Now, the hearing before the District Court, before Judge Cashin, showed that apparently Noia was aware of this reluctance in the part of the trial court to accept this recommendation and Noia apparently had this in mind when he spoke with his trial counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.089" offset="9395702">And I think the record before the trial court -- District Court clearly shows that Noia made an intelligent decision not to prosecute his appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.127" offset="9443871">I think under all the circumstances it was a smart thing on his part.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.049" offset="9463620">Now, while it's true that the District Court made no findings of fact, as Mr. Justice Goldberg pointed out in the opinion at page 63 of the record, the District Court said this, “I had thought that perhaps a hearing on the circumstances surrounding the relator's failure to appeal might reveal some exceptional circumstances which would excuse the lack of indication of ordinary appellate procedure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.889" offset="9562885">The hearing, however, utterly failed to reveal any such circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.637" offset="9581902">Now, I think that Mr. Siegel has covered the question of exhaustion of state remedies and certainly the dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.251" offset="9620355">Judge Moore, I think covers that more adequately than I could but we are concerned, so far as the Attorney General is involved, specifically with Section 2254.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.070" offset="9663613">I would not suggest to the Court that a Federal District Court is absolutely barred by the failure to exhaust state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.009" offset="9703424">Some of us, I think, had come to feel that this is, perhaps, a jurisdictional prerequisite to federal habeas corpus; I don't take that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.349" offset="9732786">I do feel, however, that the Court was -- the circuit court was incorrect in holding that these circumstances in this case are so exceptional that the man is entitled to invoke federal habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.142" offset="9787956">I see nothing so exceptional in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.914" offset="9803003">I don't think the circumstances are what have been meant in prior decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.447" offset="9825155">Those circumstances have usually been some interference by state officials with the appellate procedure, some incapacity on the part of the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.902" offset="9866951">The record here shows that the prisoner was advised by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.465" offset="9881266">He made an intelligent and knowing decision not to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.516" offset="9897462">I think under those circumstances, he properly should be barred from invoking federal habeas corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.444" offset="11237125">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.953" offset="11251231">The warden petitioner claims that the New York state procedural rule requiring an appeal from the judgment of conviction outweighs the federal substantive right under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.307" offset="11312567">They say that Noia's knowing volitional failure to appeal and those are fair words bars him from proceeding in these courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.060" offset="11359587">At the outset, we challenged the volition -- the volitionalness of the failure to appeal and the knowingness of the failure to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.779" offset="11414444">At the time of Noia's conviction under the theory which the prosecution has advanced, they had just come down from the New York courts a decision in this whole case, which says that when a man takes an appeal in a noncapital murder case, has it reversed, he goes back and stand trial and can have capital punishment imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.413" offset="11521024">This had just happened in the same court immediately prior to Noia's conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.436" offset="11553102">As Mr. Rose stated the trial judge, when the jury brought in its verdict and recommendation of mercy as to all three defendants, the trial judge accepted the recommendation as to Caminito and Bonino but reserved decision on whether he would accept it as to Noia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.959" offset="11643173">Then for the period of several weeks between verdict and judgment, Noia stayed in jail not knowing whether he would be executed or whether he would get a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.765" offset="11698448">On the day of sentence, the trial judge told Noia, as Mr. Rose has stated, “Up until this morning I was going to send you to the electric chair, but my wife convinced me to change my mind.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.248" offset="11764381">It was sometime after this, with these considerations, that Noia had trust upon him the awful choice of whether he should take his appeal and risk his life, or whether he should sit back with the judgment as rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.519" offset="11853406">He knew that he could appeal, I concede that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.784" offset="11870542">Whether under these circumstances as the petitioner argues this was volitional question?</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.110" offset="11903770">I think the Court of Appeals, although there were no specific findings of fact in the trial court, took the peoples' theory of the case and said that under this theory, circumstances surrounding the failure to appeal add up to circumstances sufficient enough to warrant or excusing the failure to appeal and therefore we will sustain a writ under the special circumstances doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.023" offset="12051414">The Court applied these special circumstances to each of three separate theories which have been advanced at one time or another as the basis for the denial of federal relief to state prisoners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.328" offset="12124662">While we feel that the petitioner's case, the facts in the petitioner's case upon which he relies are sufficient to sustain the court below's finding that sufficient circumstances warranting the issuance of the writ existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.872" offset="12210866">We also suggest to the Court two alternative theories upon which the writ can be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.143" offset="12243989">Both of these questions relate solely to the question of: Does a federal court have the power to issue the writ?</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.060" offset="12283591">I think if nothing else has been made clear by the opinions below, by two courts, by the dissents, by the arguments today, it is clear that if this is a case where -- if there is the slightest room for power to be exercised, that every court so far would have exercised whatever power or discretion it had in the relator's favor and issued the writ.</text>

            <text syncTime="3177.639" offset="12813876">The whole history of this statute, the present Section 2241, begins with the 1867 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.981" offset="12871346">Up to that time, even though there is a constitutional provision which provides for habeas corpus or its non-suspension, except in certain instances up until that time it had been held by this Court that the federal court had no power to interfere in a state court proceeding unless Congress passed some sort of enabling legislation to implement the constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.221" offset="12992240">Such a statute is passed in 1867.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.248" offset="13008332">It was passed definitely bearing in mind the then proposed reconstruction legislation and the proposed Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.221" offset="13060263">That statute has said not a word about exhaustion of state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.398" offset="13080952">It had no limitation to it except federal -- in substance that federal court shall issue the writ, hear the case, dispose of it as law and justice requires if there has been a violation of the federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.259" offset="13148453">Soon afterwards the first case under this statute arose, which set forth what has grown up to the exhaustion of state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.615" offset="13193801">Ex parte Bridges, Circuit Justice Bradley reviewing a District Court order, sustaining the writ for a Georgia defendant, a state court prisoner, who had been tried, convicted and had not appealed, the Court said that a federal court in its discretion could refrain from issuing the writ prior to the completion of the entire state court proceeding, tried, appealed and even writ of error to the Supreme Court that were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.073" offset="13347715">The case clearly rested on discretion, for in that case the writ issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.410" offset="13381047">The first case in this Court, Ex parte Royall again relying upon Bridges talks in terms of discretion which the Court has the power to issue the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.591" offset="13425768">It is discretion, however, which makes us temporize this grant of power.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.424" offset="13453040">And after that, another series of cases, all following Bridges and Royall talking in terms of discretion that the Court had the power if it wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.942" offset="13507166">The first case which seems to import a new concept beyond this exhaustion of state remedies discretion is I believe the Spencer case which was decided by this Court in 1913.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.997" offset="13583339">In that case, a state court prisoner deliberately, knowingly failed to appeal from his state court conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.955" offset="13627225">Instead he brought a habeas corpus proceeding, claiming that the state statute under which he had been convicted was unconstitutional, having ex post facto sentencing provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.600" offset="13681768">This Court, upon review or upon application for a writ, said that by Spencer's failing to appeal his conviction, he injected new issues into the case because had he appealed, the Pennsylvania Court could have construed the statute in such a manner that its constitutionality would not have been subject to attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.894" offset="13794931">Furthermore, the Pennsylvania court had the power to modify the Pennsylvania judgment which the federal court did not think it had at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.700" offset="13834219">Therefore, by Spencer's not appealing, he sought to preclude the state from making findings which would have sustained his judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.533" offset="13881553">Under those circumstances, this Court said Spencer cannot come to a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.027" offset="13911437">That I think is whether it is a decision based on discretion or waiver that is a clear example of a situation where a federal court should not entertain a writ because of failure to appeal, because something the prisoner has done, has prejudiced the position of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.064" offset="14003597">Here our case, as I will develop I hope, is that we have done nothing to prejudice the state; that the only party to this litigation was unprejudiced, he responded before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.574" offset="14069635">After Spencer, came Hawk, where this Court again repeated the history dealing with the exercise of discretion and power under the exhaustion statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.476" offset="14137240">In that case, the Court sent the defendant back to exhaust his Nebraska remedies, saying that, “We think there is a Nebraska remedy or at least he should try to find out if there is not.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.737" offset="14194291">Almost immediately after the Hawk decision, the statute was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.430" offset="14213099">It has been conceded by everyone that all the statute intended to do is to codify existing habeas corpus law up to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.800" offset="14254582">Now, the statute included as its first provision, almost verbatim what had been in the 1867 statute, dealing with the power of the Court to issue the writ, and then there were some procedural provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.482" offset="14309334">And then there was Section 2254 which had never been part of the statute before but the reviser's notes indicate, it was intended to be a codification of everything that had gone before dealing with exhaustion of state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.483" offset="14397315">We say that the statute brought in all of these decisions saying that, as far as the District Court is concerned, it has the power to issue the writ at any point in the state court proceeding but under the doctrine of exhaustion of state remedies, it should abstain from the exercise of that jurisdiction until there is no proceeding left to be had in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.685" offset="14542137">That all this is, is a doctrine of comity between the federal courts and the state courts where one court will not act upon a litigation while the other court has or could reasonably have the same issues before it in a related litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.863" offset="14626774">All that this statute was intended to do, I submit, was to say to a federal district judge, say at a time when Charles Noia's appeal was pending if one was taken wait until the state court decides the case and see what they do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.043" offset="14707545">Even further, say he had not brought his habeas corpus proceeding in the District Court and there may have been some doubt as to whether coram nobis would lie in New York, the statute says to the district judge, “Wait, let him try coram nobis in New York and maybe New York will pull their own chestnut out of the fire.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.275" offset="14792495">That is all the statute did.</text>

            <text syncTime="3680.626" offset="14825827">It was not until Brown against Allen that the Court possibly deciding it on a basis of exhaustion and discretion, possibly deciding it on the basis of waiver held that the two defendants, named Daniels are not appealing from their conviction, had forfeited their right to claim in the federal courts that they had been denied due process of law in the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.850" offset="14974725">I think, however, in order to fully appreciate the significance of Daniels, we must first look to the record in Daniels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.424" offset="15021119">That Daniels' record shows that the Daniels after the state court had dismissed their appeal stated to the defendants that if they have a substantial question of denial of right, they may proceed by coram nobis in the North Carolina courts, and that is what the Daniels' defendants did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.027" offset="15123519">They brought a coram nobis proceeding which was denied on the merits for lack of a substantial question by the North Carolina Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.860" offset="15170853">With this posture, the Daniels came to the federal court; the federal court held a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.915" offset="15203035">Judge Gilliam in the District Court found that each and every one of their claims was completely unsupported both by the state court record and by the hearing which we -- he had held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.383" offset="15264893">Their claim of coerced confession and substance boiled down to the fact that both of them had confessed after being held for one hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.004" offset="15303346">Judge Gilliam found that there was independent evidence aside from the usual accusations and denials of the parties, that there was independent corroborative evidence that the confessions had been voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3813.563" offset="15357576">On the question of exclusion of members of the defendants raised from the jury, Judge Gilliam found that all there was in this record were facts from which an inference could be drawn that the exclusion -- that there had been a deliberate exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.181" offset="15432077">But at that time, as evidenced by the Brown and Speller case, the companion cases of the Daniels against Allen, an inference was not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3841.467" offset="15469275">They required -- that was required to be a definite proof of deliberate exclusion for persons of the defendants raised from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3850.771" offset="15506474">Now, it very well may be that fact situations in Daniels at the time of their conviction might today be considered by this Court to be such as would amount to a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.675" offset="15562062">I submit that at the time of the Daniels' case that the opinion of this Court as to the merits of the case was such that their claims was so insubstantial that they barely -- that all they did was state a federal question but not prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3885.317" offset="15644609">Under those circumstances, the Court refused to allow habeas corpus to issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3893.488" offset="15677315">This Court affirming the denials suggested that all this Court was doing, although I must confess there is language to the contrary in the Court's opinion, was saying that this man -- these men have not made out their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.729" offset="15750248">They have proved nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.796" offset="15758608">After a hearing, after looking at the state record, they have just made out nothing and therefore, habeas corpus will not lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.262" offset="15800404">There is concededly language in the Court's opinion which talks in terms of waiver.</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.507" offset="15837393">This, I submit, is the only decision of this Court up to this point which injects the concept of waiver of the federal substantive right by failure to appeal in these terms into a habeas corpus litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.974" offset="15919313">We suggest that the decision in Brown or Daniels could rest very easily and I think did rest very easily upon the ground that the majority of this Court just did not appeal that the claim of denial of federal right had been made out.</text>

            <text syncTime="3995.570" offset="16085661">Because in the Brown and Speller cases, the companion cases to Daniels, the same question regarding exclusion of Negroes from the trial and grand juries had been raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.883" offset="16146892">And the issues were fra -- framed in pretty much the same way as in Daniels.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.453" offset="16169148">And I think from the opinions of the Court in Brown and Speller, it is clear that as to Daniels had the Court specifically wrote an opinion on the merits that it would have denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.078" offset="16219721">I'm guessing, I grant you that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.514" offset="16245426">Incidentally, there was misstatement in my brief where I say that Daniels had an all white jury, that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.338" offset="16272697">There was one Negro on the trial jury that convicted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.958" offset="16319195">Now, the court in Daniels and the language which the petitioner quotes at page 15, the language which -- is the language which suggests forfeiture, says that, “It is only when a state prisoner is in custody in violation of the Constitution that the statute applies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.176" offset="16416057">That fact is not to be tested on habeas corpus [Inaudible] appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4083.803" offset="16438627">We don't seek to test any facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.303" offset="16460570">We come here with a complete record, with only issues of law, with conceded facts, and with the conceded ultimate question of law of coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.433" offset="16505083">We are not trying to prove anything and because of this, because all of the facts are here on the face of the record, we seek to analogize and draw together this whole line of cases in this Court, beginning with Nielsen down to Bowen against Johnson stating that error of law appearing upon the face of the record is not waived by failure to appeal when the error goes to a substantial right such as a right under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.144" offset="16679999">And we seek to draw this in to the habeas corpus situation by the opinion of the Court in Johnson against Zerbst, where the Court talks in terms of jurisdictional defects, of jurisdiction being lost in the course of the trial because of violation of a fundamental right in the course of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.880" offset="16794937">In Your Honors -- Mr. Justice Black's opinion, he said that the failure to assign counsel in a case where the Court had jurisdiction over the subject and over the defendant, caused the Court which originally had jurisdiction to lose the power to proceed to judgment in such a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.088" offset="16883754">That, we suggest, is the basis for habeas corpus intervention in state court cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.016" offset="16919385">That a state court, somewhere in the course of a proceeding, commits an error so gross that the Court loses the power to proceed to judgment and that the judgment which it renders is a nullity and under these line of cases the loss of jurisdiction is never waived if it appears affirmatively on the face of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.263" offset="17040384">Now, it is suggested here that despite concession that perhaps Noia's and because of the Appellate Division decision that Noia's case is a little less strong than Caminito and Bonino.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.361" offset="17104854">The horror of this case is that Noia's case is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.059" offset="17123558">It is considerably different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.738" offset="17134320">Noia is the only defendant who was able to produce undisputed evidence that he was beaten. Neither Caminito nor Bonino were able to do this.</text>

            <text syncTime="4298.941" offset="17299101">Dr. Sparandino testified, “When I examined him, he had large bruises on his right thigh.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.382" offset="17324910">He had some contusions at the scalp.</text>
            <text syncTime="4307.696" offset="17334105">He had some contusions at the lower posterior chest wall, on the left chest wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.727" offset="17354271">Complained of pain in the stomach and said he'd been kicked.</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.273" offset="17368482">There was a large bruise, a black and blue mark, in area of about I would say, about two or three inches in diameter.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4322.700" offset="17394186">He complained of a few injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.299" offset="17416547">Also, his codefendants, Caminito and Bonino, who too claimed that their confessions were coerced and whose lives were at stake in this proceeding, testified that Noia had been far more badly beaten than they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="4343.149" offset="17476002">This case is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4351.054" offset="17507558">Now, up through Brown against Allen, we suggest that the doctrine of adequate of state grounds has played no part in a habeas corpus litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4367.790" offset="17574536">The first, as far as I can find, the first suggestion of it appears in one of the opinions in this Court in Irvin against Dowd.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.276" offset="17612466">The court below treated that the doctrine of adequate state grounds is being applicable to habeas corpus proceedings, but in so treating it, it also found there were circumstances which did not make it dispositive to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.037" offset="17687489">While we agree with the court's discussion below, we wish to also suggest that the entire period of adequate state grounds has no application in this kind of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.685" offset="17738062">That the theory of adequate state grounds applies only to this Court's power to review a decision which comes directly from the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4421.667" offset="17789994">That the theory of adequate state grounds first laid down in Murdock against Memphis in substance hold that this Court is not going to take a case which it can't decide or where it can't decide the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="4440.615" offset="17865853">And while that is an oversimplification of a rather significant decision, I think in substance that is what -- what we're dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4452.092" offset="17911724">This Court could not have granted certiorari to Judge Fuld's decision in the New York Court of Appeals and said, “First we find the confession coerced, that is the federal question we decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.885" offset="17982882">But you could not reverse the case and send it back to New York with directions to sustain a writ of coram nobis because New York does not have the power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4480.772" offset="18026454">It has no such procedure for this kind of case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4486.290" offset="18048502">This Court will not take a case, I believe, for the purpose of creating a procedure in a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4496.730" offset="18090297">Now, although its opinions may at some time influence a state court to create a procedure, this Court apparently does not do the creating, that is for the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.241" offset="18140348">It is for the State of New York to say we have a remedy or we don't have a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4514.678" offset="18162082">And if they don't have a remedy and the case is appropriate for federal action then the federal court will exercise the power which the State says it doesn't have.</text>
            <text syncTime="4526.001" offset="18207326">Now, this I do not think is any great intrusion upon the state court process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4532.817" offset="18234598">All New York has said is, “We don't have the power to let this man out.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4536.847" offset="18250794">They haven't said he shouldn't get out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.915" offset="18275035">We ask the federal court to exercise the powers which New York says it doesn't have and I think that there have been several recent decisions which show how -- first, how the federal court's reaction in a habeas corpus case will to some extent influence and beneficially influence the state court procedures.</text>
