            <label>Mr. Robert B. Hummel</label>
            <text syncTime="9.640" offset="141981">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.226" offset="168312">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.779" offset="190464">The judgment of the Court of Appeals set aside an order, cease and desist order, of the Federal Trade Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.673" offset="226095">The issue is, under Section 2 (a) of the Clayton Act as amended by the Robinson-Patman Act, is a violation to discriminate among customers where the effect may be to tend to create a monopoly, to tend to eliminate competition, or to injure competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.137" offset="323897">Here, the question is, does the Section 2 (b) proviso to the Section 2 (a) violation which I have just related which exempts such a discrimination, having the proscribed defect, where the discrimination is made “to meet an equally low price of a competitor” apply to a special price made to aid a customer, meet his competitor’s price.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.595" offset="457749">In brief, the pertinent facts here are, the Commission found that the respondent, Sun Oil Company, have violated Section 2 (a) of the Act by giving price concessions to one Gilbert McLean, an operator of a retail service station in Jacksonville, Florida, which was not given to other Sun stations in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.167" offset="564015">The examiner and the Commission found that this caused competitive injury to other stations, and specifically to the operators of four other Sun stations located in the immediate area within less than a mile to three-and-a-half miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.332" offset="636740">The finding of competitive injury which was made by the examiner and confirmed by the Commission was not appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.191" offset="676133">What was appealed arose out of the fact that the price, the lower price given to McLean was given because he was losing business to a cut rate station across the street, a Super Test station.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.168" offset="740080">It was claimed that this was a price made to meet an equally low price of a competitor within the meaning of the proviso to Section 2 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="168.645" offset="777906">The Court of Appeals held that this was within the meaning of the proviso, overruling the Trade Commission’s finding that it was not, and we’re here to contest that ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.398" offset="832972">I propose to discuss the issues in the following fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.324" offset="848645">First, I will discuss the statute as applied to just the limited facts which I have related and then I will propose to discuss the statute as applied in the economic setting and in the light of all the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.145" offset="911966">Turning to the statute on the limited facts, the Robinson-Patman Act was designed to assure equality of opportunity among customers, and by that means, to promote the health in small business and of the free enterprise system.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.420" offset="993050">Thus, the House Report which we quote in our brief at page 27, states at page 8, the existing law has in practice been too restrictive in requiring a showing of general injury to competitive conditions in the line of commerce concerned, whereas, the more immediately important concern is an injury to the competitor victimized by the discrimination. Only through such injury, in fact, can the larger general injury result.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.063" offset="1123662">It was pursuant to this philosophy that the Robinson-Patman Act was enacted, and to this extent, the proviso is an exemption or an exception to the major purpose of the Act for the Act reflects Congress’ judgment that the way to promote competition in this area is to assure that so far as possible, there will be equality of opportunity among the customers of a particular seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.896" offset="1255006">The Act itself reflects dissatisfaction basically with the scope of the old “meeting competition” defense which had been in the Clayton Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.994" offset="1295339">And to that extent, if I should use the expression meeting competition, it seems to me that I am not properly stating the content of the Section 2 (b) proviso, although I admit that it’s easy to slip into this expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.876" offset="1378826">We have reviewed the history of the Act detailed and at length in our brief and it is reviewed at considerable length in the decision of this Court in the Standard Oil decision in 340 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.101" offset="1451760">That decision reflected the judgment of this Court that the Section 2 (b) proviso was a defense, an absolute defense, three justices dissenting on the ground that it was a fact -- a factor which the Commission could take into consideration, but need not accept as an absolute defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.846" offset="1542771">This Court decided that it was an absolute defense, but the Court concluded, I refer now to the majority opinion at the conclusion of its opinion, that the proviso to Section 2 (b) is understandable as “continuing in effect a defense which is equally absolute but more limited in scope than that which existed under Section 2 of the original Clayton Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="387.543" offset="1653530">Now from this, we make just the simple point that the Section 2 (b) proviso was meant to limit the scope of the so-called meeting competition defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.141" offset="1703894">It was added as a limited exemption to the main purpose of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.053" offset="1731584">Now here, we are not arguing that the words to meet an equally low price of a competitor need be construed narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.035" offset="1771499">We are simply arguing that they be construed in accordance with natural, normal usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.342" offset="1796786">In natural, normal everyday English, reference to a competitor means ordinarily someone who is at the same functional level, a manufacturer against the manufacturer, a wholesaler against the wholesaler, a retailer against the retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.812" offset="1858644">I don’t intend to dwell on this point too long, but it seems to me a point that we have not hitherto given sufficient attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.350" offset="1912769">In normal usage, the corner jeweler selling Elgin watches for example is not a competitor of the Bulova Watch Company nor is the butcher who sells Swift &amp; Company meats ordinarily considered a competitor of the Armor company.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.837" offset="1970761">Now I'm not saying that the word competitor cannot have the vertical as well as horizontal meaning, which the expression clearly has in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.484" offset="2017259">Simply said that in these examples, normal understanding is that it has a horizontal meaning and I point out to the Court that the examples I give are cases where there is a direct appeal by the manufacturer to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.033" offset="2079535">There is brand or loyalty at work and this is not a concept which is a concept which is new since the passage of the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.094" offset="2115793">Yet neither party to this proceeding nor the amicus or either the friends of the Court has submitted any examples from the legislative history of the Robinson-Patman Act, indicating debate, reports, or otherwise that any members of the Congress considered the words -- the word competitor to have this vertical impact that a manufacturer selling a branded article could be in comp -- could be a competitor of a retailer.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.682" offset="2246092">Now, we're not saying that there could not be circumstances under which this would be so and under some concepts under the antitrust laws, this might very well be so, but we're dealing here with a limited exception to a broad policy provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.002" offset="2303352">This --</text>

            <text syncTime="551.183" offset="2308054">This is a -- this is a peculiar kind of a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.940" offset="2327176">It's certainly not like a jewelry store which sells a variety of brands of watches and many other items manufactured by many manufacturers and sold by -- probably by many wholesalers.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.880" offset="2374928">This is a -- this automobile -- I mean these service stations, gas stations although setup as independent entrepreneurs sell one product and have no choice, isn't that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="585.852" offset="2446817">I don't know that it's unique but it's certainly quite different, quite different from the ordinary jewelry store or dry good store or department store.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert B. Hummel</label>
            <text syncTime="592.161" offset="2471999">Well, I could perhaps give you the example of a shirt store specializing in handling a particular brand of shirts and very often it carries the name of the manufacturer of the shirts, Arrow Shirt Store, Manhattan Shirt Store, and it is its primary article of commerce just the retail gas -- service station sells other things besides gasoline and it sells accessories, tires, batteries, and well, it carries the name of the supplier of gasoline on the station. It is not under the Clayton Act required to carry all of the products of the station -- of the oil company.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="633.862" stopTime="639.555">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="633.862" offset="2638869">But those -- that is the fact, that those are the facts of life generally, they do carry the products of only one manufacturer, do they not?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_b_hummel" startTime="639.555" stopTime="712.542">
            <label>Mr. Robert B. Hummel</label>
            <text syncTime="639.555" offset="2661543">Yes, they do and we say, our position is that out of that -- the extent to which that station is tied to a particular manufacturer is the result of the choice of the manufacturer basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.583" offset="2717654">For example, the Sun Oil Company, there's a prior United States Government proceeding against Sun Oil, arising out of the coercive tactics which it used to require its dealers to carry the tires, batteries, and accessories of Sun, but here, we have a service station in a position of subservience to the supplier.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.550" offset="2805530">We submit that this position of subservience ought not to be the occasion for bypassing the injury against which the dealer cannot protect himself because he is the titled supplier.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.180" offset="2856103">He can't go out and find an alternative source readily because that's not the way the majors do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.578" offset="2881703">Arising out of that fact, it seems to us not to be a conclusion that he ought thereby just suffer the lost which the four particular service station operators here suffered as a result of the discriminatory price given to the McLean.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="712.542" stopTime="721.222">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="712.542" offset="2953592">Of course -- I suppose a fortiori, it's quite clear that had this price reduction not been granted, McLean would've gone out of business very quickly?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_b_hummel" startTime="721.222" stopTime="727.169">
            <label>Mr. Robert B. Hummel</label>
            <text syncTime="721.222" offset="2988283">Well, there is a conclusion to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.252" offset="3008345">I would suggest that --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="727.169" stopTime="730.542">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. Robert B. Hummel</label>
            <text syncTime="730.542" offset="3025586">Well, there were six price cuts in -- with respect to McLean that were deep over a period of six months in the price war which ensued when Sun gave a price cut to McLean which he did not give to its other dealers, there was a period of more than six weeks when all of the dealers of the area, including the dealers for some six or eight other majors who were within a two-and-a-half mile or two -- within a radius of two or three blocks, were competing as substantial disadvantage to McLean.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.058" offset="3183574">McLean sold some better than 30,000 gallons of gasoline in the month of January.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.346" offset="3220773">The Super Test Station sold 70,000 gallons of gasoline in that same month after the price war which ensued when Sun gave the cut price to McLean.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.812" offset="3258598">Now that was five or six times as much gasoline as it had been sold through that corner previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.486" offset="3281272">That gasoline came from somewhere and where it came from was out of the sales of competitive gasoline dealers who were not given the same price allowance by their supplier, and in particular, four Sun dealers who lost, as I will illustrate later, more both in gallonage and percentage wise during the month of January than then McLean lost in the entire six months that he was in competition with the Super Test Station without the special help of the Sun Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.973" offset="3435290">But to get back to the statute without the complicating additional facts for the time being, this Court in the Standard Oil case used the word competitor in a number of occasions and gave examples which were all of this horizontal type.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.512" offset="3525465">Now the facts of that case involved only the horizontal situation which I am now discussing.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.476" offset="3549288">So I'm not saying that the Court had it be -- had that issue before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.828" offset="3562663">I'm simply saying that this is the natural, normal way, to use the language, and in all the examples given in the Standard Oil opinion and all the examples given in the debate during the Robinson-Patman Act history in Congress, the horizontal meaning, manufacturer against manufacturer, wholesaler against a wholesaler was repeatedly used.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.900" offset="3659003">I would suggest that to open up by means of the Section 2 (b) proviso, a situation where every time a retail store cuts the price on one item of branded merchandize, it immediately becomes face to face in competition with the manufacturer of other -- another brand of merchandize which -- with which that brand competes is to open up an unwarranted exception to the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="974.345" offset="4000789">The letters which are attached to the brief of the amicus of Texaco indicate that it was about a year from the middle of 1954 to the middle of 1955 when the Commission repeatedly held that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.700" offset="4086157">Prior, I may say also that prior to 1951, this Court's decision in the Standard Oil case, the problem had different overtones because Section 2 (b) was not considered to be an absolute defense in any attempt by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.035" offset="4159509">Our position is that the argument of the respondent and Texaco as friend to the Court that this proviso was to be construed broadly in light of the fact that it has the word competitor in it, and therefore, assumedly reflects the general purpose of promoting competition, does violence to the structure of the statute and the intention of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.185" offset="4288136">Texaco indeed speaks of giving this proviso a preferred position such as it deserves in a competitive society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.786" offset="4318542">That's at page 25 of the amicus brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1086.051" offset="4447587">Second, they find it that the effect of that discrimination maybe substantially to lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly or to injure, destroy, or prevent competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.765" offset="4494399">And in the find -- in the face of those findings to say that the policy of free enterprise is exclusively promoted as is argued here by the proviso to Section 2 (b), is an odd way to construe the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.294" offset="4572557">Now, it's not clear entirely as I now turn to the more detailed facts of the case, that the court below did not accept our construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.420" offset="4637027">The careful reasoning of the opinion indicates that among other things what the court did was to integrate the Super Test Station across the street backward and at the same time, integrate the Sun station forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.257" offset="4716440">It said that Sun advertised heavily and appeals directly to the consumer, and that the retail gasoline dealer is simply a conduit for delivering gasoline to the consumer, that is a rare bird among merchants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.343" offset="4788746">The effort in this approach is to put Sun and Super Test on the same horizontal level which I have suggested is the normal way to read the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.994" offset="4835349">We think that the dealer's legal independence which Sun saw assiduously creates itself, cannot thus easily be put aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.183" offset="4900133">The dealer bears the risk of the loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.795" offset="4914552">He is merely a tenant in the Sun station with a supply contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.256" offset="4932420">Sun carefully sets it up that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.708" offset="4950183">Now on the facts of this presentation, it is not easy to see how we, all of a sudden, in a situation where Sun claims the right to deal unequally with its tenants in the stations to say why we're going to ignore this independence and say this dealer is something between an independent contractor, something less than an independent contractor, and something more than an employee as the court below did.</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.564" offset="7597641">The examiner found that this caused the nearby Sun dealers substantial injury and I may say that one of them, the examiner found, dropped from 10,900 gallons in December which was before the price war to 9300 in January.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.192" offset="7696175">That's a drop of about 1600 gallons or about 15%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.957" offset="7719163">The examiner found that another dealer dropped from an average of 17,000 or 18,000 gallons a month to 14,500 in January during the price war.</text>

            <text syncTime="1944.029" offset="7879450">Some of that probably was to Super Test, but I may say that when -- the way the price war came about, Super Test on the 27th of December cut its price to 24 and ninth tenths cents a gallon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.849" offset="7962728">McLean had been selling at 28 and nine tenths cents a gallon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.778" offset="7982477">When he got an allowance from the Sun Oil Company of one and seven tenths cents a gallon, he cut his price 3 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.164" offset="8016018">He hadn't cut it all at that point, but when he got this allowance, he cut it 3 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.252" offset="8036394">That put him within 1 cent of the Super Test price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.045" offset="8051545">Now Super Test generally and the non-major gasoline generally have been selling in a 2-cent differential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.461" offset="8077249">So Super Test dropped another penny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.858" offset="8086758">When that happened, it was Super Test and the Sun stations selling well below the regular price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.130" offset="8115911">And moreover, a Royal Arrow station or Red Arrow station, next door also dropped to the Super Test price, another non-major, it dropped an additional penny.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.044" offset="8163558">So that, here was all of this gallonage flooding into this corner, now some of it was undoubtedly going to these non-majors because the price gap at that -- the greater the price gap, the more likelihood there is that some customers who would otherwise buy major gasoline will buy this gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.675" offset="8230118">But the point is that the Sun Oil Company was financing this price war, we submit, out of the pockets of the surrounding retail gasoline dealers and in this case out of its own gasoline dealer's pockets because --</text>

            <text syncTime="2128.834" offset="8618715">The lower court describes it as being predatory in two or three occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.081" offset="8651734">There is uncontradicted testimony in the record by the Vice President of the Sun Oil Company and by the Director of Marketing Research for the Sun Oil Company, that what Super Test was doing was the commonly used tactic of a non-major breaking into a new market, getting a foothold in the market, building up the gallonage quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.006" offset="8743372">Let me read just briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.318" offset="8752671">Mr. Charles, the Director of Marketing Research, “Super Test used the commonly used methods of more rapidly developing volume in new service stations that is used by such outlets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.620" offset="8805857">They first utilized the low price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.350" offset="8812753">They lowered the normal price and they advertised that price extensively.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.392" offset="8828949">That's on page 232.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.838" offset="8838771">Then Mr. Wright, the Vice President in-charge of marketing, on page 222, gives his understanding of what causes price wars and he lists a number of ways in which price wars come about and the third one is this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.803" offset="8910555">He says, page 222, “for one of the chains, and this is particularly true where the chain builds a new station, the change man -- chain's management may decide that it would lower the price at that particular chain in order to get that station off to a good start and build a high gallonage with greater rapidity than normal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.533" offset="8993520">This is a practice that is rather well recognized in the industry.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.914" offset="9007000">Now here's a newcomer coming into a market, opening up a gasoline station.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.637" offset="9021942">To get that gasoline station of to a start, its cut the price -- cut the price six times in the course of six months, first the grand opening sale that was held six weeks after it opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.000" offset="9079411">But the idea is, you got a non-major line of gasoline and want people to try that gasoline, you induce them to come to your station with a lower price, and in the hope that they will like it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.705" offset="9138239">The major oil companies spend -- Sun in this case, spends a third of a cent a gallon in advertising its product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.880" offset="9170944">By that third of a cent of gallon, it manages to maintain for its one price gasoline, at this time it had only one rate, a margin of 2 cents over the non-major brands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.777" offset="9222457">It induces the dealers to sell Sun gasoline because it promises them a somewhat protected area from other Sun dealers and it promises them a margin of two cents over the nonstandard brands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.923" offset="9279091">Having established these stations, induce them to come in and take over the operation and this record as it indicates, there is a $2000 deposit involved and then when it gets involved with some price competition, with a non-major trying to break into the market, cuts the price to one station and I say finances a large portion of that price war out of the pockets of the other dealers because they find themselves instead of having a two-cent margin over non-major gasoline, they suddenly find themselves in competition with other stations, selling Sun gasoline at a substantially lower price here, three cents lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.308" offset="9460590">Burying the clang, crabcree and winning, four Sun station operators who testified in this case, found themselves during this period that they were in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.236" offset="9496325">They weren't all in business during the whole period, found themselves in a condition where they were competing with Sun gasoline being sold at 3 cents lower than they were selling at.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.877" offset="9546898">And we said -- I said this -- this was a means of financing a price war out of the pockets of the dealer and I'd like to explain how this works.</text>

            <text syncTime="2423.117" offset="9795793">I would say not and that's why I preceded my argument, this part of the argument by discussing how you construe the statute, whether you look for this purpose of promoting competition under Section 2 (a) violation which requires the finding that there be a tendency to monopolize or a tendency to eliminate competition or a substantial injury to competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.321" offset="9900701">And that you're dealing here with a very limited proviso so that you -- this is not a case where the Court should take all of the facts and look for the ultimate solution which in its judgment will best solve the problems of price wars in the gasoline industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.268" offset="9984397">This is not a problem susceptible of being so readily solved and certainly not through the -- a construction to be given the Robinson-Patman Act which stands for some general principles which we insist should be adhered to, but these facts which the lower court referred to put an equitable gloss on the case which the Sun Company presents and I'm going into them just for the purpose of ascertaining just what is the impact that these factors which the Court discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.604" offset="10133817">When you get right down to it, after you have discussed the fact that the gasoline station is subservient to the Sun Company because it's tied to it as a supplier, the station is painted with the colors of the Sun Company, that it's a lessee who come right back with the proposition that what really lends some color to the Court's proposition that the manufacturer is a competitor of that retailer is that it's a brand product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.645" offset="10249906">The argument is that gasoline like other products has a direct brand appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.224" offset="10276237">The testimony of the Vice President of Marketing of the Sun Oil Company at page 210 of the record, illustrates this point and I may say that it also illustrates the point that it's a brand appeal that isn't much different from other brand appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.419" offset="10337050">He says, “All manufacturers and distributors of branded products have been emphasizing the superiority of their brand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.818" offset="10370696">They do the [Inaudible] advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.307" offset="10376652">They emphasize their brand through the type of package they use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.702" offset="10390131">They are neat.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.257" offset="10392430">They are objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.030" offset="10395460">They are easy to handle.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.275" offset="10400475">I would also say that during this time, all consumers were buying branded packed products in packages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.309" offset="10428583">They buy coffee in packages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.241" offset="10436315">They buy brands of cookies in packages and it has been the same with gasoline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.262" offset="10456377">So the issue is, does a retailer of a branded product who finds in -- who cuts the price of that branded product, does he invite a situation where the manufacturer of other branded products automatically and instantaneously becomes his competitor and he finds himself facing the manufacturer in competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.428" offset="10561076">And let me say this, “Not only does the manufacturer thereby come in competition with the retailer by this process under this construction, but he has the right to pick and choose which of the retailers he's going to favor in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.243" offset="10644355">This Section 2 (b) proviso is not something which a manufacturer has to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.174" offset="10668074">It's something which he has the option to follow and if he doesn't like the situation in which this particular retailer is demanding a pay price cut, he doesn't have to give it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3068.267" offset="12376482">The court below therefore took a panoramic view of the statute, of the antitrust laws, and of the economic realities involved in the marketing of gasoline and saw that suppliers indeed compete for the business of motorists that suppliers are indirect in continuous communication with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.105" offset="12475747">The Court then centered its attention on 19th and Pearl Streets, a residential area in which most of the buyers are highly price conscious coming from low income groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.252" offset="12540426">The Commission looks upon the words of the statute narrowly and in adopting its construction, it told some to do one of two things; to reduce its price to all dealers, when the dealer like McLean finds himself subjected to a price rate by a chain retailer or to go into direct retailing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.029" offset="12655470">That result was not found by the court below to be consistent with a proper construction of the statute or the spirit and purpose of the antitrust laws as a whole.</text>

            <text syncTime="3226.707" offset="13010213">Well before 1954, the statute was in language when it was construed definitively, was in a language different than the language which is involved now and which was involved in 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.312" offset="13076668">The statute at one time spoke of the meeting of the -- meeting of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.729" offset="13102268">It was amended to read upon the meeting of a lower price of a competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.902" offset="13127032">It is our reading of the legislative history that the purpose of that amendment was to prevent a beating of a lower price rather than a meeting, but not to disturb at all the essence of the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.459" offset="13189204">And this Court, in Standard Oil, in 340 U.S. said that despite all of the amendments to the statute, the core of the defense was not at all effective and that it continued to be that wherever a lawful lower price of a competitor threatens to deprive a seller of a customer, the seller to retain that customer may in good faith meet that lower price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.612" offset="13313860">Now, what is involved here is an attempt on the part of Super Test, a chain retailer to deprive Sun of a customer it's outlet McLean by deep price cuts over weekends and sporadically from time to time so that Sun could not readily respond to them, deep price cuts of as much as 5 cents a gallon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.149" offset="13419917">Now, the Commission's position is that if Super Test had made an offer to McLean to sell him gasoline at a lower price, Sun could have met that offer by giving McLean a discount.</text>

            <text syncTime="3419.646" offset="13781974">This coincides with the Commission's view, but the reality is that Sun is just as much deprived of McLean as an outlet by price cuts, by Super Test of 5 cents a gallon which threatened to destroy them and if Super Test wins him over by offering 2 cents of gallon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.326" offset="13868701">In either case, the core of the matter as this Court put it in Standard Oil, the core of the matter is that Sun is being deprived of the customer and the defense exists to enable a seller to defend himself against such a price rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3466.728" offset="13970265">No, if this statute were a statute which did not meet structure, we would not be here but it is so -- inartificially drawn as this Court and other courts have found that we must search for its meaning by resort to reason to analogy the consistency of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.239" offset="14056364">Now, on the level of reason, I submit that if we could discriminate to meet a Super Test offer or an offer of a major to say to McLean that essentially, competition is being just as much protected by giving him the kind of assistance that we could give him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.807" offset="14138598">Now this kind of an attack upon Super Test -- upon McLean, could be made by companies only differ from Super Test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.461" offset="14181230">This is not a confrontation simply between Sun Oil Company and a chain retailer called a private brand or an independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.501" offset="14217383">For example, if a West Coast refinery [Inaudible] should determined into come in to the Eastern market, it could do so and to break into the market, the lower prices of the station office of McLean, without violating the law, and Sun would be confronted by a major competitor of formidable size.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.596" offset="14333785">For example, to spend just a moment more on this, Union Oil Company is in California in a case pending in the Ninth Circuit is shown to be marketing gasoline by consigning, not selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.125" offset="14403897">If the Union Oil Company determined to go into the Florida market and located the station office of McLean and there sold gasoline through an agent to whom gasoline was consigned and dropped the price to break into the market, 3 or 4 or 5 cents surely, Sun should be in a position to meet that competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.060" offset="14507656">Now it's the view of the Commission that we must reduce our price to all dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.452" offset="14533151">This is what the Commission said in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.157" offset="14547989">In its brief in this Court, the Commission said that we should reduce our price to all dealers in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.325" offset="14588635">Now, there is great difficulty, however, in determining what the area shall be and to remain free regardless of the determination of a lawsuit by the Commission and likely determination that you have violated your office in top of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.163" offset="14668048">May I take a few minutes to point out why that is so?</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.829" offset="14702738">I just want to focus the attention if we may on McLean for a moment by way of introduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.081" offset="14731682">The only source of help which was available to McLean was Sun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.746" offset="14754356">While Super Test with its chain of resources could fix any price it pleased, McLean's ability to compete depended upon Sun's price to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.551" offset="14801586">If to help McLean, Sun had to reduce its price everywhere not only would that be economically unreasonable and not supportive and active sound business judgment, but it would have several profound consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.474" offset="14881311">Suppose Sun reduced its price everywhere, there would be no discrimination and we would have no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.813" offset="14914644">As soon as Sun tried to narrow everywhere and to define a market, the problem is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.493" offset="14945364">For in the first place, Sun might select too wide an area, the whole of Florida for example and then there would be a great risk of primary line discrimination, the kind of discrimination identified by this Court in Moore against Mead's Fine Bread or the kind of discrimination found to exist in the Pure Oil case to which my learned friend referred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.639" offset="15065945">In Pure Oil, Pure reduced its price to all of its dealers in Birmingham, but not to its dealers elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.770" offset="15106487">This was found to be primary line discrimination, hurtful to the independent chain retailers in Birmingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.791" offset="15154552">Second, we risk selecting two narrow an area and a charge of the secondary line price discrimination even if we select an area larger than McLean, the only one who seemed to be hurt by the bouncing ball kind of price discrimination which was off again and on again every few days.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.855" offset="15262804">The most illuminating decision on this subject has come down recently from the Federal Trade Commission and when considered with its decision in this case, exhibits the profound difficulties which the Trade Commission's doctrine presents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.476" offset="15333230">In American Oil, it appeared that Paraland was a private brand and the Shell Oil Company, a major, reduced its price to narrow the two cents brand between the Paraland and Shell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.858" offset="15454856">American then went down in Smyrna, but not in Marietta, these being adjacent communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.575" offset="15517654">The Court found that American who was guilty of secondary line discrimination because the dealers in Marietta were injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3867.003" offset="15571362">So the selection of an entire community did not protect it from a charge of discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="3930.578" offset="15825690">If American had chosen to give equally large discounts to its Marietta dealers, where could it have safely stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.286" offset="15860485">Smyrna and Marietta are located along a major north-south highway with gasoline stations in every town along the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.725" offset="15894235">A price cut to any station or group of stations would be bound to affect the sales of nearby stations up or down the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.720" offset="15926209">And if American made its reductions to all stations on this highway, there would undoubtedly be effects upon stations located on adjacent and intersecting roads.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.694" offset="15974170">Under the Commission's theory, American's only safe alternative would be to reduce its prices to all of its dealers everywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.656" offset="16010010">But if the Commission prepared to say that this enlargement of the local [Inaudible] buyer into a nuclear price war would have effects upon competition less injurious than those of the course of action which American actually pursued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.939" offset="16071137">Now, the sequel to this came just the other day and as I've said, Shell was the first major to go down in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.515" offset="16117426">In the reply brief filed yesterday by the petitioner, it is only argued that there need be no concern about the area of price discrimination because the Commission has stated its policy be that surely there would be some fringe effects that these will not bring it about that there will be a violation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.097" offset="16223796">And in support of that argument at page 6 of the reply brief, the argument was on that a representative of Shell Oil Company testified before a congressional committee looking into this subject that such price assistance as they give dealers is now offered to all their dealers in a competitive retail marketing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.621" offset="16337899">Well last week, the Commission filed a complaint against Shell because it gave assistance to its dealers in Smyrna as American did.</text>

            <text syncTime="4150.573" offset="16705703">Now, the other alternative of the Commission then is to go into direct retail and this -- the Commission explicitly advises it might do if it needed a direct price release upon its business which is really one that's involved by chains like Super Test.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.700" offset="16810193">Now, it is our submission that the elimination of the independent dealer from the American scene was not one of the purposes of Congress in adopting the Robinson-Patman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.761" offset="16858467">There were two main evils which the price discrimination law seeks to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.305" offset="16896606">The first was identified before the Robinson-Patman Act was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.036" offset="16923564">That statute, if we take back originally, was adopted to prevent a driving out of competing sellers by price discrimination, something we have come to term or here termed as primary line discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.519" offset="16997439">When the Robinson-Patman Act came, it was to deal with another evil primarily, the confine of a competitive advantage on large chain buyers by giving them lower discriminatory prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4239.903" offset="17062954">Neither of those evils is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.742" offset="17082389">Primary line discrimination charge is not charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.323" offset="17100675">McLean was not a large chain buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4253.072" offset="17115617">He was our outlet that we were trying to protect and a moment's reflection would show that a marketer like Sun gains nothing by helping McLean at the expense of gallonage sold by nearby Sun dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4274.298" offset="17200567">It's merely taking gallonage from one dealer and transferring it to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="4279.270" offset="17220420">At the same time, we make our dealers unhappy and dissatisfied and we gave nothing at all by discriminating in price and helping less than all who are under attack.</text>

            <text syncTime="4365.747" offset="17566386">He almost in a sense reaches over the dealer to make direct contact with motorists.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.813" offset="17598673">He maintains the bulk of these supplies, the dealer having very little storage deposit and he provides a uniform product.</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.897" offset="17634931">He keeps the brand in high esteem and the dealer is as Mr. Justice Jackson put it in his dissent in the Standard Stations case, a conduit so that the verity is that the supplier of a branded product is in competition for the business of the motors with anyone else who is seeking that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.314" offset="17736600">Now, this is of course a theoretical possibility that such a situation might arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.097" offset="17779754">I would point out that it is not very likely that Sun would exercising judgment lower its price where a dealer without any assistance from a supplier, a single dealer lowered his price in competition with McLean and the evidence of that is that for four months, Sun carefully refrains from doing anything to help McLean.</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.065" offset="17915591">In retrospect, we acted too late, but this evidence is the unlikely one that absent an attack of an aggressive sort why someone like a chain or like another major able because of superior resources to destroy McLean.</text>
            <text syncTime="4479.836" offset="18022693">As to that kind of attack, it is unlikely that Sun would give assistance but in the presence of such a confrontation as existed here, a chain retailer with 65 stations versus a small businessman, McLean, Sun I think had given a situation like that as the statute permit as construed here might come to the assistance of it, every dealer who seems to be hurt might be expected to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="4841.947" offset="19471130">There was an augmenting of the force and vigor of competition when Super Test if it had one station or 65 stations lowered its price, the competition was theoretically benefited by that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4862.353" offset="19552737">And if the situation went on that way, there would be an augmenting of competition compared with the situation just before.</text>
            <text syncTime="4869.872" offset="19582830">Now if in addition, Sun can help McLean lower his price, there is a further augmentation of competition so that the competition is aided and the fundamental aims of the antitrust laws are promoted by the construction of the court below.</text>
