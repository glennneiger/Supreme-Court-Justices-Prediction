            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="18.518" offset="177403">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.972" offset="191300">In this case, there is only a single issue and that is the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.672" offset="218049">Jurisdiction here is challenged on the ground that respondent Reliance’s operation are not sufficiently connected with interstate commerce so that a labor dispute arising there would affect commerce within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.839" offset="294745">The trial examiner addressed himself to this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.349" offset="308746">He made findings and he concluded that the Board had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.187" offset="332152">The Board adopted the findings of the examiner in this respect and held that it had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.725" offset="358275">On petition for enforcement by the Board before the Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit, the findings on the merits were approved, but the court had some doubt about the jurisdiction of the Board over the dispute in question, but the court didn’t resolve that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.306" offset="436642">It simply felt that the findings were insufficient and therefore remanded the case to the Board in its words to make further findings -- take further evidence and make further findings on the manner in which the labor dispute at Reliance affects or tends to affect commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.376" offset="516890">The Board petitioned for rehearing unsuccessfully.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.085" offset="527757">The court issued a short supplemental opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.780" offset="542490">From the decision we're not denied rehearing, we applied -- the Board applied to this Court for certiorari which was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.805" offset="582614">The relevant jurisdictional facts are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.322" offset="596616">Reliance is a fuel oil dealer on Long Island in New York State.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.458" offset="625246">It sells fuel oil for heating purposes to homeowners, all of whom live on Long Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.326" offset="656697">It also services their burners, their oil burners.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.532" offset="677491">It's gross sales in 1959, 1959 is the pertinent period because labor dispute charged here occurred in January and February 1960 and these were the most recent figures, in 1959, this company, Reliance, sold something over six-and-three quarter million gallons of fuel oil of a value exceeding half a million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.668" offset="782085">Besides certain office personnel, supervisors and salesman, the company had 21 regular employees, 11 of whom were truck drivers, the other 10, service personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.771" offset="842480">These 21 employees are those that were involved in the labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.197" offset="868185">I won't detail the labor dispute the way in which it was resolved because that issue is now before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.329" offset="896711">The -- as I say, the court affirmed the Board's finding that Reliance had been guilty of unfair labor practices towards these 21 employees and in an inappropriate order which was affirmed or which the court indicated it would affirm if it had not had doubts about jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.688" offset="974137">Getting back to the jurisdictional facts, Reliance buys this oil which it sells to homeowners on Long Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.783" offset="1006529">It buys most, if not all of this oil, from the Gulf Oil Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.851" offset="1030771">These purchases during the pertinent period, exceed $650,000 for the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.207" offset="1064208">Gulf Oil Corporation of course is a large company, concededly involved in interstate commerce, with more than $3 billion in annual gross revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.197" offset="1108198">Now the greater part of this fuel oil which is sold by Reliance on Long Island, and which it purchases from Gulf is refined by Gulf out of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.323" offset="1160652">Gulf brings it in from outside the state into its tanks in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.977" offset="1191267">From there, it ships a certain portion to its tanks, Gulf's tanks, at Long Island from where the company involved, Reliance picks it up and delivers it to its customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.525" offset="1241422">Summarizing the jurisdictional fact then, Reliance locally sells a product which has been manufactured out of state, but which has twice temporarily come to rest within the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.589" offset="1297742">The volume of these purchases is well over a quarter of a million dollars, probably more than half a million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.315" offset="1332642">Another fact that should be emphasized perhaps is that purchases by Reliance are not made through an intermediary.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.603" offset="1361795">They're made directly from the manufacturer, the company involved in the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.466" offset="1389275">Now on basis of these facts, the Board held that it had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.760" offset="1406412">That said it didn't simply assume jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.462" offset="1417174">It discussed the question, it added specific findings, it concluded the jurisdiction existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.295" offset="1444551">The findings of the Board which takes three pages in the record, pages 10 through 12, will bear out that session.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.097" offset="1483734">At the beginning, I like to stress that the Board did not rest jurisdiction solely on a finding that its monetary standards were satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.794" offset="1530546">There's an implication in the Court of Appeal opinion and in the respondent's brief that what the Board did in effect per se, this is a retail concern, our discretionary standard with respect to retail concerns is the gross volume of business standard of half a million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.703" offset="1610167">Reliance meets this test, therefore, we have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.091" offset="1627721">The Board did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.498" offset="1633364">It found that there was indeed more than half a million dollars worth of gross volume of business, but it also separately, independently found that the activities of Reliance were so related to interstate commerce that a shut down of this plant would affect interstate commerce in the statutory and constitutional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.650" offset="1741928">We don't ask this Court to hold that every time there is a company which has indirectly imports of more than X dollars and those X dollars meet the discretionary standards which the Board has setup, therefore, the Board should exercise jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.917" offset="1819042">We recognize that the Commerce Clause is not to be measured in terms of rigid dollars spent.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.820" offset="1862614">This also addresses itself to the contention that the Board in this case has abandoned the case by case approach and has tried to find a formula which is applicable in all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.864" offset="1914859">The Board did not do that in this case and we do not now urge the Court to adopt or to permit the Board to adopt any rigid formula for testing legal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.994" offset="1983300">On the other hand, of course, the importance of this case if we win it, is that the decision will establish that you don't have to go into all of the unique minutiae of every case and that you don't have to make detailed predictions as to the manner in which the labor dispute will actually affect interstate commerce somewhere along the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.497" offset="2085386">It seems to us that on the basis of the facts that were cited, all of which are included in the findings of the trial examiner, in turn adopted by the Board, there clearly was jurisdiction under the prime decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.710" offset="2142229">So we are faced with the question, why wasn't the Court of Appeal satisfied?</text>
            <text syncTime="514.657" offset="2161977">Well first of all, we notice, I'm putting the two opinions of the Court of Appeal together, the original opinion and the short opinion rendered on but now on rehearing, that the Court approached this whole question as one of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.690" offset="2230105">In their supplemental opinion, they in effect conceded that Congress might constitutionally have given the Board authority over a company like Reliance on the basis of these indirect imports, but the Court felt that Congress had confined the Board within narrower limits.</text>

            <text syncTime="557.038" offset="2331564">Mr. Claiborne, [Inaudible] specifically described in the 1959 amended Section 14 (c)?</text>

          <turn speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="592.116" stopTime="623.804">
            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="592.116" offset="2471790">Mr. Justice Goldberg, it is certainly true that by in effect of freezing the lower limit of the Board's discretionary standards, Congress assumed that anything above that would be within the ambit of the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.187" offset="2552142">Of course, we can't rely too heavily on that because we knew this is a constitutional matter and congressional declarations to the contrary, we must still deal with the Commerce Clause itself.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="623.804" stopTime="632.088">
            <label>Justice Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="623.804" offset="2598640">[Inaudible] the Court of Appeal [Inaudible] that this is matter of statutory discretion, has this not been a statutory discretion by the Government?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="louis_f_claiborne" startTime="632.088" stopTime="968.698">
            <label>Mr. Louis F. Claiborne</label>
            <text syncTime="632.088" offset="2631764">It had.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.672" offset="2634062">Now the Board does take this position that it is not sufficient to meet the dollar standards when those dollar standards are simply in terms of gross volume of business and had nothing whatever to do with imports or exports.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.266" offset="2692472">And that the standards which Congress was approving, some of them, like the one in this case, since they had nothing to do with imports or exports, must be added to by an additional finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.667" offset="2750046">But certainly, the congressional adoption of the Board standards which were then the same as they are now, it does show that the Court of Appeals was looking too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.354" offset="2808769">But in any event, we don't have to examine this question of statutory interpretation because this Court has repeatedly held that Congress gave the Board in the NLRA as much jurisdiction as it constitutionally could.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.698" offset="2866134">That was decided back in the days of the Edison case and Fainblatt.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.333" offset="2884733">It was reaffirmed only recently in the Guss decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.887" offset="2902915">So we view it as a constitutional question and not as a statutory interpretation question.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.548" offset="2929560">Now perhaps this error in the Court of Appeal approach undermines the whole of their opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.736" offset="2958294">They were looking rather cautiously for an actual effect on interstate commerce in the terms of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.203" offset="2992149">They admitted that if it were a constitutional question, it would be jurisdiction, but they thought the statute must be more narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.197" offset="3036139">But facing then the constitutional question, the question still remains whether a shutdown in a business which sells locally, a product which was usually manufactured out of state affects interstate commerce in the constitutional sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.152" offset="3103953">To us, the answer is obvious and it would be pointless to demonstrate that a shutdown at Reliance would tend to cut down Gulf's shipments to Long Island which in turn would affect Gulf's imports into the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.901" offset="3190993">So the real question is why wouldn't this natural anticipated result take place?</text>
            <text syncTime="778.000" offset="3215339">The Court of Appeals had several suggestions on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.472" offset="3237282">These are the additional facts which they thought might be relevant in that connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.377" offset="3256926">I'm now reading from their opinion at page 169 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.295" offset="3276570">We cannot tell from the meager record before us anything about the volume of commerce in heating oils in the relevant market Gulf's participation therein, Reliance's contract relationship if any with Gulf's national distribution system, Reliance's proportion of Gulf's commerce in the relevant market, all the number and availability of ultimate distributors to Gulf and to Reliance's customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.199" offset="3388165">We think that all of these additional facts which the Court of Appeals thought relevant are in fact irrelevant and the decisions of this Court have already disposed of these arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.214" offset="3456188">Now as to the first one, Reliance's contract relationship, if any, with Gulf's national distribution system.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.980" offset="3499342">This is an effort to assimilate this case with the Howell Chevrolet case.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.584" offset="3525674">We can't say that it would be irrelevant if such a connection were established, but it certainly is not a necessary premise for jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.573" offset="3569664">And in our particular case, there is no indication anywhere in the record that such a connection does exist and therefore no excuse for remanding simply to require us to negate what the record itself is already now suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.811" offset="3634657">And secondly, the Court was interested in the question of the volume of commerce in heating oils in the relevant market, Gulf's participation therein and Reliance's proportion of Gulf's commerce in the relevant market.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.184" offset="3692126">And this sounds more like an antitrust case, factual finding than the Labor Board jurisdictional case.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.682" offset="3730056">These facts might be relevant to determine whether there was a tendency to monopolize or whether there was a tendency to restrain competition, but they don't have any relevance in determining effect on commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.097" offset="3787734">This Court has repeatedly said that percentages are irrelevant in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.557" offset="3817618">Moreover, even if we conceded that in some cases, percentages might be relevant where you have a trivial volume of commerce involved when you have over half a million dollars, it doesn't matter whether this is 1% or 10% or 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.187" offset="3880103">It's still more than de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.708" offset="3890239">It's clear that the elimination of half a million dollars worth of commerce does affect commerce and we don't think it necessary to pursue a demonstration that the relative percentage would make any difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="1012.059" offset="4151568">Now finally, the finding that is suggested as required by the Court of Appeals is with reference to the availability of ultimate distributors to Gulf and to Reliance's customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.387" offset="4204962">I'm not quite sure which part of that clause means what the distributors to Gulf could mean Gulf's supplies or it could mean Gulf's customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.906" offset="4251042">Now analyzing it, it must mean Gulf's customers because Gulf's supplies have no bearing at all in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.989" offset="4287300">The distributors to Reliance's customers could mean simply other sellers of fuel oil from whom Reliance's customers could buy if Reliance were out of business temporarily or what.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.178" offset="4348113">But that wouldn't solve the problem because these other dealers might be selling local oil and not out of state oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.141" offset="4387924">So it must mean other sellers of Gulf fuel oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.262" offset="4404433">So boiling down the whole clause, it seems to us that the only fact that can conceivably be relevant in the Court's mind is whether Gulf has ultimate local distributors who could handle Reliance's total of their oil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.225" offset="4476322">I think the question whether this is relevant or not is determined by the Bradford Dyeing case in which this Court very plainly said that it was not material whether out of state customers of Bradford which was in the dyeing finishing business could find another Rhode Island firm to do the same work so as not to interrupt the flow of commerce, but even if the Bradford Dyeing case doesn't itself resolve the issue, it may be appropriate to point out the enormous practical difficulties in determining whether a so-called available substitute outlet is really a substitute outlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.750" offset="4658343">That's why you'd have to find out whether you'd have to start with a firm already in business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.149" offset="4688018">The fact that there's an existing demand or an existing market is sufficient because it takes time to setup a dealership in this case to erect tanks and to make the arrangements with the buyer himself and even a temporary interruption with commerce was that -- with effect on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.251" offset="4760325">And you have to find a dealer who is ready and willing to handle the new business because you have to find customers, you have to find these customers, Reliance's customers, willing to switch their business to the new dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.264" offset="4832423">Next time that Gulf is ready and willing to do business with the new dealer and there may be a lot of reasons why it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.837" offset="4866696">Gulf may think we now have three dealers who won our product in Long Island eliminating Reliance that leaves us only two for all we know there will be a strike of the other two, it isn't worth importing this oil for this market any longer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.028" offset="4943496">We can sell it just as profitably elsewhere so we won't import it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.534" offset="4961468">All I'm trying to show is how complicated, how cumbersome, how realistically impossible it is to determine in any given case whether or not there really exists a substitute market for the product which will no longer be imported by the company which is suffering from a labor dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1589.879" offset="6462882">The respondent in this case, Reliance Fuel Oil Corporation is a New York corporation was engaged solely in the sale of home heating fuel oils to customers who consume the product within the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.895" offset="6538951">It is true that it acquires its products from the Gulf Oil Corporation who is concededly engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.472" offset="6581269">Gulf refines its products, petroleum products in addition to a number two fuel oil, outside of the State of New York, transports its products to the City of New York and from the City of New York, some of its products reach its ocean side terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.262" offset="6672384">They are loaded in stationary tanks without segregation as to customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.801" offset="6698611">It is at this point that Reliance, as well as many other dealers of the Gulf Oil Corporation, remove the product and either sell it to customers within the State of New York where it is consumed or Reliance redelivers it to its own tanks in Massapequa, Long Island from which tanks it redistributes it to the customer where the product is consumed and disappears.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.551" offset="6821595">I have been in this case from its very inception and I was under the impression until I heard argument of my adversary that the Board had rested its theory of jurisdiction insofar as a local concern was concerned, strictly on the dollar amount and it need go no further to establish jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.270" offset="6924413">That was the position taken before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.610" offset="6937788">As a matter of fact, that's the questioned then before even hearings are conducted before the Board simply assessed to the dollar amount of business done within the State of New York and the dollar amount of purchases acquired from people engaged in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.409" offset="7004975">No further questions were asked as to what effect work stoppage would have upon interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.419" offset="7037053">Before the United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, the same position was taken by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.517" offset="7065475">And it was before the Court of Appeals that we took the position that the Re -- petitioner had to go a step further in establishing jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.464" offset="7113226">The dollar amount was insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.108" offset="7123780">True, it is arguable that $500,000 is a substantial amount in situations where Gulf does a gross annual business of $3.170 billion, $500 million may not be so substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.810" offset="7190653">Then again, there's been no proof of any nature whatsoever that a work stoppage in this particular case would have any effect upon interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.809" offset="7246660">My adversary glossed over the fact that Gulf in and of itself, and it's conceded, is engaged in the retail and non-retail fuel oil business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.322" offset="7300681">Gulf could immediately step in, in its retail operation and supply the very customers supplied by Reliance Fuel Oil Corp.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.231" offset="7336312">without that much interruption in the flow of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.227" offset="7360240">What my adversary intends to convey to this Court is that we are now practicing in a court of convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.124" offset="7391901">It's so much easier to assume jurisdiction if we set forth the dollar amount and go no further, but we are not courts of convenience, we are courts of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.503" offset="7433383">The statute says that the NLRB has jurisdiction over all employers engaged in interstate commerce or whose business affects interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.569" offset="7501615">The use of the word effects, I place emphasis upon that word because that's the word that must be interpreted by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.322" offset="7548635">The petitioner must come forward with proof in a court of law as to what effect a work stoppage will have upon interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1873.697" offset="7598164">We cannot deal with presumption because there are no legal presumptions to substantiate the position of this petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1920.434" offset="7785096">Any case that fell below the standards, notwithstanding the fact that the issue might have been in interstate commerce was immediately referred to the State Labor Relation Boards.</text>
