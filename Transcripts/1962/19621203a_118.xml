            <text syncTime="26.079" offset="207705">This is an appeal from the Superior Court of Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.631" offset="229857">Before appellants, Bantam Books, Dell Publishing Company, Pocket Books and the New American Library of World Literature are publishers of paper bound books distributed in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.257" offset="292446">The appellees are the members and the executive secretary of the Rhode Island Commission to encourage morality and youth.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.148" offset="335914">This appeal raises two basic questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.274" offset="356498">First, does Rhode Island Resolution Number 73 which created this commission tend to suppress or inhibit the circulation of books in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments?</text>
            <text syncTime="82.679" offset="434134">Secondly, did the Commission's actions in sending notices to book sellers and police chiefs throughout the State of Rhode Island stating that, “particular publications were objectionable for a sale or display to youth tend to suppress or inhibit the circulation of those books and did those actions actually suppress or inhibit the circulation of those books again in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments”.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.229" offset="616260">Rhode Island Resolution 73 was enacted in 1956, its operative provision as amended in 1959 insofar as pertinent here reads as follows and I read from page 2 of the record, “It shall be the duty of said Commission to educate the public concerning any book, etcetera, containing obscene, indecent, or impure language as defined in chapter 11-31 of the general laws entitled obscene and objectionable publications and shows and to investigate and recommend the prosecution of all violations of said sections”.</text>
