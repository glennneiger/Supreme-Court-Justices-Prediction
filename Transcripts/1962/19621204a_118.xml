            <text syncTime="126.425" offset="609050">By early 1960, the Commission admitted that it had found 108 books and magazines thus objectionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.309" offset="664639">One of the recipients of these notices was the firm of Max Silverstein and Sons of Providence which was the exclusive wholesale distributor of appellant's books for 70% to 75% of the State of Rhode Island including all of the City of Providence.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.957" offset="759202">The first notice that the Silverstein firm received was dated July 19, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.771" offset="802461">It appears at page 55 of the record and as you will note is on the official letterhead of the Commission as were all the other notices.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.735" offset="850317">It contains several significant statements and I should like to read some of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.603" offset="881768">This agency was established by a legislative order in 1956 with the immediate charge to prevent the sale, distribution or display of indecent and obscene publications to youths under 18 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.153" offset="948015">“The Commissioners have reviewed the following publications and by majority vote, had declared that they are completely objectionable for sale, distribution or display for youth under 18,” then those three magazines, and then it goes on, “The Chiefs of Police have been given the names of the aforesaid magazines with the order that they are not to be sold, distributed or displayed to youths under 18 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.892" offset="1058983">The Attorney General will act for us in case of non-compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.720" offset="1082284">The Commissioners trust that you will cooperate with this agency in their work.”</text>
            <text syncTime="250.001" offset="1103391">And then the notice ends, “thanking you for your anticipated cooperation”.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.754" offset="1130350">A further Commission threat to recommend prosecution to the Attorney General is contained in another Commission notice being petitioners' Exhibit 11, we being the petitioners down below.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.714" offset="1202239">That Exhibit appears at page 76 of the record and I should like to read the last two sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.018" offset="1243408">“Your cooperation in removing the listed and other objectionable publications from your newsstands will be appreciated.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.937" offset="1283114">Cooperative action will eliminate the necessity of our recommending prosecution to the Attorney General's department.”</text>
            <text syncTime="304.549" offset="1321566">This coupling by the Commission of the word “cooperation” along with the mention of Attorney General's action makes it quite clear that when this Commission used the term “cooperation” in these two notices and the other 33 notices it meant to convey to booksellers a message.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.425" offset="1429086">“You either take these books and magazines off sale or else we're going to see to it that you'll be recommended for prosecution.”</text>
            <text syncTime="340.887" offset="1466911">Now, to make -- to make certain that this message would register with the booksellers, the Commission notified them that they were sending copies of all these notices to the Chiefs of Police throughout Rhode Island and the copies were so found.</text>

            <text syncTime="428.622" offset="1817893">And about two years have gone by since -- since that.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.651" offset="1849971">But the Commission was not satisfied with sending these copies to the Police Chiefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.719" offset="1878288">In every case, they followed up with a questionnaire to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.862" offset="1906813">On this subject, the appellee McCallum, the Executive Secretary of the Commission testified and I quote from page 45 of the record, I asked him the question, “Will you tell us what do these questionnaires that are referred to in the minutes?”</text>
            <text syncTime="465.121" offset="1963865">Mr. McCallum answered me.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.983" offset="1971284">Answer: The questionnaires were sent to the various Chiefs of Police in the State asking them of why they had followed up any list if they admit any cooperation or any negative action.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.351" offset="2024782">The effect of this -- of these methods is shown by the fact that the record shows that within 10 days after everyone of these Commission notices were sent out, the firm of Silverstein received an inquiry from the Providence Police Department asking for a report of what action had been taken with the respect to every listed publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.225" offset="2148289">A police officer inquired as to how many copies of the publication Silverstein originally received, how many he had tried to recall from its customers, how many it had shipped back to the publishers.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.984" offset="2219342">So you see that this procedure produced the desired effect of frightening all of the sales, books that had been listed by the Commission as objectionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.932" offset="2271065">Thus, the record shows that every time Silverstein received a list of publications, it took off sale every copy, it sent out its field man to its retail customers and recalled every copy, and then it took all the unsold copies and shipped all of those copies back to the publishers.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.334" offset="2372733">Silverstein took this action as its manager Kaplan testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.894" offset="2402931">And I quote from page 25 of the record at the bottom of the page, “Rather than face the possibility of some sort of a court action against ourselves as well as the people that we supply”.</text>

            <text syncTime="2110.369" offset="8544841">I'm saying that while it is true that publications that are obscene are not entitled to constitutional protection, it is equally true as stated by this Court that publications that no state has the power to restrict the dissemination of publications that are not obscene at the question of whether a particular publication is obscene or not obscene, involves a question of constitutional judgment as was stated by Mr. Justice Harlan in his concurring opinion in Alberts against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.020" offset="8707427">Such a constitutional judgment, we say, can be made only by a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.445" offset="8737102">Therefore, until a court decides what is obscene, we just don't know what publications ought to be deprived of their constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.327" offset="8780675">If the effect of a statute is to coerce the suppression of publications without a prior court determination, we have no assurance whatever that such suppression would be confined to publications that ought to lose their constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.851" offset="8882761">Such a statute would have a tendency to inhibit constitutionally protected expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.515" offset="8917452">That was just the kind of a tendency that led this Court to strike down the ordinance of Smith against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.576" offset="8957680">Now, I say this Resolution 73 has this very tendency because it confers the right and the duty on the Commission to educate the public as to any publication containing obscene or other, any et cetera is the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.110" offset="9055796">Now any book here plainly means specific books and the Commission has construed it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.867" offset="9094875">Any education of the public as to what specific books are obscene constitutes and implies threat on prosecution unless the sale of those particular books is stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.210" offset="9168227">And we say that that's what exactly what the Rhode Island legislature intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.931" offset="9199052">Now, in the Rhode Island Supreme Court, the rationale of the Court was mainly that there is no power here to order prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.838" offset="9254745">We say that power or lack of power is not the determining factor what is fundamental and what is inescapable here that this resolution which includes that confers on an official body that threat to recommend prosecution has had the effect of inhibiting the circulation of books in Rhode Island without the prior Court determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.417" offset="9405001">It gives some other reasons but they're dealt with it in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.796" offset="9422555">Now, I say to inject -- they said let us all do the voluntary cooperation and the record is absolutely the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.452" offset="9465187">And we say that to argue that this case involves voluntary cooperation is just engaging in semantics and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.189" offset="9528090">These were threats from the beginning to the end and the result is you got 108 -- 108 publications taken off sale during that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.279" offset="9572498">And we don't know which one of them should have lost their constitutional guarantees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.800" offset="9598621">And if this kind of procedure is allowed to go on, we don't know how many of the other states will encourage this and you have your adult population also deprived of what the Commission was talking about should not be published for those under 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.371" offset="9676884">We say that both the resolution on its face is unconstitutional because you can't have -- constitutionally have a non-court educate the public as to specific books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.899" offset="9734980">And two, that the actions of the Commission are unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2482.259" offset="10032358">The Resolution does nothing more than great -- grant state sanctions to a group of individuals whose authority is limited to educating the public of Rhode Island with good reading habits and to investigate in the objectionable material and were warranted making recommendations to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.172" offset="10132041">The Commission has no power beyond that listed in the Resolution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2967.582" offset="11973674">I feel that the distributor has the choice either to stand on his ground if he differs with the finding of the Commission that these books are objectionable and to sell these books at his peril and incidentally, since the decision of this Court in the Smith case in which as you recall this Court struck down a Los Angeles ordinance which made a criminal offense to sell obscene books without proof of scienter in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.441" offset="12105122">I think that in order to successfully prosecute a bookseller for violating the provisions of the criminal anti-obscenity statute in Rhode Island that a person in authority such as the Attorney General should make a preliminary judgment and put these distributors and booksellers on notice that in the judgment of the Attorney General, such and such a book is, in his opinion, legally obscene and then of course the bookseller can stand on his ground and sell a book in his own peril, and take his chances in Court with a judicial determination as to whether or not the book is or it is not legally obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.869" offset="12290800">We had that situation about a year ago in Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.987" offset="12307310">The book ‘Tropic of Cancer' if you recall that book was band from importation of the United States from 1935 until June of 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.604" offset="12345762">And in the fall of 1961, the book was on display on the newsstands, our newsstands in Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.886" offset="12378885">A complaint was made some May firstly that in the opinion of this person, the book was legally obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.003" offset="12411382">That was on a Friday afternoon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.054" offset="12419636">I read the book over the weekend and I concur, and I made a public announcement on the following Monday that in my opinion, the book was legally obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.383" offset="12460910">And the result was that some of the distributors who had issued these books and had them on the newsstands voluntarily recalled not one bookseller or distributor chose to take his chances in Court with a judicial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.271" offset="12552443">There were some criticisms of my action in that case and -- but I welcomed a court test, but it never came about.</text>

            <text syncTime="3128.393" offset="12616913">I think it's important to recognize the phraseology of this Resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.212" offset="12644185">In 1955 and 1956 in Rhode Island, we have a -- an increase in these so-called trashy magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.709" offset="12682219">I think that was the characterization of my brother Mr. Manges, on with reference to some of these dirty magazines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.849" offset="12710745">And the legislature recognized that the situation and it seems to me in the exercise of that constitutional mandate, they enacted this Resolution and they were very careful with reference to the phraseology.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.363" offset="12772812">I was a member of the legislature at that time and I remembered very well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.523" offset="12789426">And it seems to me that they actually did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.832" offset="12802696">First of all, in the very first paragraph, they authorized this Commission to educate the public that was probably used under 18 but also adults as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.673" offset="12874062">And then later on, it also said to investigate the causes of juvenile delinquency and to make recommendations to the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.744" offset="12918366">And it wasn't until July of 1957 that this Commission started to send out these notices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.597" offset="12949713">I can frankly say, “Hey, I never saw these notices before they went out.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.296" offset="12968521">But my predecessor, Mr. -- who is now on the Supreme Court of Rhode Island, Mr. Justice Powers, he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.969" offset="12995271">And he advised the members of this Commission to send out these notices, these guide lists which, in our judgment, are merely advisory and nothing more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.412" offset="13045008">And the distributor, as I said before, can stand his ground and sell these magazines, books and magazines at his own peril.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.161" offset="13083982">This situation, this factual situation, I think is very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.783" offset="13102477">And it's quite unlike the situation you have in New Jersey in the Melko case, and that was around 1954 with reference to the book “The Chinese Room”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.534" offset="13145527">And in that case, the county prosecutor, one of the counties in New Jersey, he made a statement and in his opinion that this books was obscene and that anybody who had it in their possession, any news dealer or bookseller should get it out of circulation and the result was the action was instituted against it.</text>
