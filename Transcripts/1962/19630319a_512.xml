            <text syncTime="15.984" offset="167267">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.167" offset="184090">This is a Federal Employers' Liability Act case, which was tried initially in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Kings County before the court and jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.511" offset="241455">The jury returns the verdict in favor of the petitioner in the amount of $15,000.On the respondent's motion the trial judge set that verdict aside and also granted respondent's motion to direct the verdict for the defendant, the Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.347" offset="316792">An appeal was taken to the Intermediate Court of Appeals, the Appellate Division of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.962" offset="343228">And that court affirmed the action of the trial judge by a vote of four to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.138" offset="363917">A further appeal was taken to the Court of Appeals in Albany.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.726" offset="382307">That court affirming the action of the trial court unanimously.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.557" offset="405608">As I've mentioned this is a Federal Employers' Liability Act case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.070" offset="423685">The petitioner at the time of the accident was an employee of the Pennsylvania Railroad, the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.387" offset="456913">The accident occurred in January of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.739" offset="474363">The petitioner was working for the respondent as a car repairman helper in the respondent's Sunnyside Yard in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.743" offset="514382">In those yards the respondent maintains wheel pits.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.112" offset="531832">These are pits which are used by respondent's employees to remove old wheels from railroad cars and install new ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.626" offset="569866">The pit itself is very similar to a grease pit underneath an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.060" offset="591600">That is, if they cleared out the space between the running rails on which the railroad car sits so that the men can get down into the space from three or four feet and work beneath the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.448" offset="641128">The wheels are replaced by moving the car over the pit and rolling underneath the car a movable hoist to a jack which is attached to a movable platform which rolls at the bottom of the pit.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.534" offset="705494">The hoist is then raised to the level of the wheels.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.251" offset="720332">The wheels are disconnected from the car, lowered to the bottom of the pit and rolled out.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.079" offset="747708">The old wheels are replaced by new wheels which are again rolled underneath the car on this movable platform and raised by the hoist to the point at which they can be securely and firmly affixed to the railroad car.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.635" offset="809880">It was the job of the petitioner to assist in this operation being performed that one of these three pits.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.315" offset="844675">That his job at the time of the accident was to stand on this wooden movable platform and hold with both hands a rather heavy spring as the new wheels were being raised to be placed in position where they could be securely affixed to the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.261" offset="920430">As he was doing this, the platform on which he was standing suddenly shifted or moved causing him to lose his balance.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.135" offset="1019904">I think it's important to the case and the issues to discuss just for a moment the apparatus that was being used.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.006" offset="1051355">Starting from the top and down there is the railroad car which sits on the rails which straddle this pit.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.765" offset="1078418">Extending down from the body of the car and attached to the car are two pedestals or a pedestal linings, I'll refer to them as pedestals.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.780" offset="1118542">These are U-shaped receptacles into which a portion of the wheel assembly which is being raised from the bottom of the pit fits.</text>

            <text syncTime="349.007" offset="1499408">That's the device that's apparent on page 113, on the outside of the wheels just above the rail on the photograph, plaintiff's Exhibit 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.479" offset="1549249">Now that wheel assembly is being raised by a lift.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.012" offset="1567431">The lift consists of a vertical member and a crossbar or tee at the ends of which are two V-shaped prongs into which the axle fits.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.841" offset="1618735">The crossbar is attached to the upright portion of the lift by a nut.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.227" offset="2392273">And he testified that because of this very situation, he himself at a safety meeting held before this accident had complained about this condition to the foreman, that is the railroad foreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.151" offset="2447966">And that in response to the complaint, a safety device in the form a hook-and-eye had been stalled in one of the three pits in the yard to hold the platform in position, but that no safety device or no clamp or hook-and- eye had been installed in this particular pit.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.066" offset="2523617">So the Railroad counted the testimony by producing one of its assistant foreman who testified as an expert but testified solely based on his experience, that is, he was not an engineer and brought no engineering background to his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.942" offset="2583176">He testified that in his experience, there was not this one to two inches of movement as testified by the petitioner at the point at which the journal boxes were inserted into the pedestals.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.539" offset="2629569">But that the movement was only a quarter of an inch.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.334" offset="2640750">And that therefore in his opinion, the movement was limited to a quarter of an inch at the platform level and that the platform could not move.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.713" offset="2674186">That's a -- disputed fact was raised with respect to the snugness of the pit, the snugness of the pit between the journal box and the pedestals.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.443" offset="2721102">The Railroad assistant foreman testified that the pit was quite snug indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.417" offset="2741060">The petitioner and the mechanic testified that the pit was not quite as snug as testified by the railroad foreman, it was some one to two inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.714" offset="2782229">I submit that this was a disputed fact which was resolved by the jury in favor of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.013" offset="2811382">But the trial court however, resolved the dispute otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="770.714" offset="3186186">The -- and I think the trial court recognized that because when the respondent's attorney moved that the conclusion of the plaintiff's case, that's on page 54 of the record, there was a motion made to dismiss the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.821" offset="3246686">And the respondent's attorney argued to the trial court that the platform could not move because the journal box has been partially inserted into the pedestal.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.833" offset="3294751">The trial court stated, and I'm quoting, “I have witnesses who came here and said that it moved and could move.</text>

            <text syncTime="833.081" offset="3435708">The opinion of the trial court deals at some length with a test -- a statement introduced by the respondent taken from the mechanic, that was the man in charge of the pit who said that the platform moved, he saw it moved, and that -- there was sufficient mobility or movability, or play, that is the pit was not as snug as the foreman had said it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.270" offset="3520449">And the trial court in characterizing the statement and I'm reading from the trial court's opinion, which is on page 124 of the record, stated, “Further, the testimony of the -- of petitioner's fellow employee”, that's the mechanic, “was directly contrary to his prior written statement given immediately after the accident in which he blamed the accident on petitioner's carelessness and exculpated the defendant railroad from any negligence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="882.873" offset="3634866">The trial court also in its opinion stated that the Railroad's evidence that the platform was immovable was not rebutted by petitioner when the fact was that petitioner testified specifically an answer to questions on a cross-examination by the Railroad counsel, that the platform was movable, that the journal boxes, when they fit into the pedestals, did not fit that snuggly, and that the mechanic had testified to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.049" offset="3755551">The Appellate Division, although it wrote no opinion, published a decision and the decision picks up the language of the trial court and states that there was uncontroverted proof that the platform could not move.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.861" offset="3822843">I submit that the trial court and both the appellate courts were in effect weighing the credibility of evidence in doing what this Court has said in Lavender against Kurn, “Is an undue invasion of the province of the jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="944.082" offset="3879685">The decision of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York, which appears on page 15 of the petitioner's appendix, deals at considerable length with the so-called contradictory statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.321" offset="3928691">As a matter of fact, the statement is almost completely summarized in the Court of Appeals decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.533" offset="3953455">I've cited in my brief, the cases of this Court, dealing with this question, that is Lavender against Kurn, Wilkerson against McCarthy, the Rogers case, the Schulz case, and this Court within the last 30 days or so has decided at least two cases on this very point, the Gallick case and the Harrison case.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.398" offset="4032972">The Court has repeatedly held that the fact issues which are raised in this F.E.L.A cases are to be resolved by the jury, not by the trial court and not by the appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.856" offset="4078843">Here, the trial court and the appellate courts weighed the testimony and resolved these fact issues in favor of the Railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.733" offset="4110294">The jury came to the opposite conclusion and I submit that it's the jury's decision on these fact issues that should stand.</text>

            <text syncTime="1209.092" offset="4939734">As petitioner's counsel has pointed out, the petitioner, a car repairman helper in the employer, the respondent Railroad, was working with three other employees in the number three wheel pit of the respondent's Sunnyside Yard in Long Island City at approximately 2:15 a.m. on January 7, 1956, engaged in changing a pair of wheels on a passenger car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.065" offset="5051643">At pages 114 to 120 of the record are printed photographs of the type of equipment involved in the operation which the petitioner and his fellow employees were engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.181" offset="5112142">The various photographs show various of the stages involved in the operation of changing a set of wheels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.200" offset="5148191">And I might point out that the photographs themselves are, in my humble opinion, the most convincing evidence that we have in this case, that the platform did not in fact move.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.618" offset="5217886">I refer to plaintiff's Exhibit 2, which is printed at page 114 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.686" offset="5258115">This is a photograph which shows either the work completed or the work not having started except that the gate rail has been swung open to permit the wheels to be taken from the car.</text>

            <text syncTime="1318.405" offset="5377024">It's the same type of car that was involved in this accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.341" offset="5400743">We can see both of the journal boxes in the petitioner's Exhibit 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.355" offset="5432822">We can see both of the helical springs which are on the truck of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.439" offset="5465109">We can see the truck frame and the pedestal lining which lines the arch into which the journal box fits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.241" offset="5512338">And in res -- in petitioner's Exhibit 2, we can see that the flanges on either side of the journal box on the outside of the truck are sliding along the pedestal lining and are in a position where the entire flange is alongside of the pedestal lining, and where the bottom of the flange is considerably above the bottom of the pedestal lining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.370" offset="5632815">We can also see that the equalizer bar which -- on which both of the springs rest has fit into a groove on the top of the journal box itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.753" offset="5710346">Respondent's Exhibit A printed at page 116 of the record shows the type of hoist involved in the operation but before being raised to the axle of the wheels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.730" offset="5774294">It will be seen in this photograph that the wheels over the hoist are still on the rails.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.083" offset="5811702">This photograph shows a portion of the piston.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.781" offset="5826539">And this piston admittedly, is physically and permanently attached to the platform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.014" offset="5855378">It shows the crossbar with the prongs or forks at either end which fit on the axles of the wheels with the highest point of the forks farthest away from the center of the hoist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.443" offset="5913161">It also shows the nut and bolt marked with an “N” by which the horizontal bar is attached to the cylinder portion of the air hoist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.519" offset="5965406">The respondent concedes that with the platform in this position, it can move laterally from side to side.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.822" offset="6006680">The testimony of the petitioner's witness was that with the pair of wheels on the hoist it took four men to move the platform.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.716" offset="6050252">So that we can see it's not something which readily moves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.830" offset="6066657">The wheel, the set of wheels weighs approximately 3100 pounds plus the weight of the platform and the hoist itself, the testimony was that it took four men to move it one way or the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.366" offset="6172818">The platform, I believe was twelve feet in length so that it was approximately eleven feet of movable distance, which is required in order to take the platform with the wheels out, put a crane down to take one set of wheels off, replace the wheels with the crane, and then move it back under the car so that the new set of wheels can be applied to the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.470" offset="6273233">In other words sir, the platform itself had to come out from underneath the car so that the wheels could be physical removed from the platform and a new set applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.118" offset="6323806">Respondent's Exhibit B, which is printed at the 117 of the record, and this shows a truck assembly with the type of journal box involved in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.615" offset="6565804">This photograph also shows the flanges of the journal box on the outside of the journal box.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.075" offset="6595688">There are similar flanges which slide along the pedestal lining, the same pedestal lining of the same truck on the other side of the same journal box, that is on the side of the journal box closest to the wheel itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.202" offset="6656188">This also shows the journal box fitted into the arch of the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.965" offset="6683251">Exhibit B of course shows only the wheel and journal box on one side of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.603" offset="6709791">There was a similar journal box with its flanges and similar pedestal linings on the other side of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.711" offset="6742183">In other words we can only see two flanges on the outside of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.306" offset="6760573">There are in fact four flanges for each journal box and two journal box for each set of wheels so that in fact we have eight flanges that are involved in moving this one set of wheels up into the pedestal lining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.768" offset="6830477">Respondent's Exhibit C is a photograph printed at one -- page 118 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.836" offset="6858689">This shows the same equipment with the journal box now moved up further into the pedestal lining and with the equalizer bar now in the grove at the top of the journal box.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.479" offset="6925249">This was concededly the position of the equipment just at the time that the petitioner and his mechanic put this spring seat and that's the spring seat which is shown in respondent's Exhibit B printed at page 119 of the record, in the place designed for it on the equalizer bar and then inserted the coil spring into its position between the equalizer bar and the underside of the frame of the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.472" offset="7077282">It will be noted that at this time and this is the time just before the helical spring was inserted into the cup.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.549" offset="7121586">The entire length of the flanges have moved up to a position along the pedestal linings where the bottom of the flanges are some distance from the bottom of the pedestal lining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.283" offset="7192534">Respondent's Exhibit E is a photograph printed at page 120 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.174" offset="7224090">This photograph concededly shows a man holding the helical coil spring in approximately the same position as the petitioner claims to have been holding the helical spring at the time of this accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.044" offset="7299532">We can see that the spring seat is in position on the equalizer bar and the coil spring is in the cup on the underside of the frame and in the cup of the spring seat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.651" offset="7369958">It is the contention of the petitioner that while he was holding the helical spring in the position shown in this photograph, respondent's Exhibit E, printed at page 120.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.878" offset="7434846">And while the air hoist was moving the set of wheels further up into the truck, he saw the platform move.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.081" offset="7519692">This was at 2:15 in the morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.639" offset="7533902">The testimony was that there were lights shining down on the men working in this pit but that there were no lights at the bottom of the pit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.508" offset="7589386">You will note in the photograph that in holding the helical spring, the man is directed towards the car and I say and it has been our position throughout that to say that this man saw the platform beneath him move is incredible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.105" offset="7691786">And it's interesting to note that neither the petitioner nor his mechanic at anytime said, “How much it moved?</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.110" offset="7727835">In which way it moved, whether it moved up, down, sideways or whether it merely vibrated?”</text>

            <text syncTime="1915.803" offset="7766601">And I say and it has been our position throughout that in the position that this equipment was in, the platform could not move.</text>

            <text syncTime="1997.730" offset="8094281">And you will note that in defendant's Exhibit E, the man is holding the helical spring with two hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.341" offset="8116746">What I believe the petitioner was doing was holding the helical spring with his right hand and holding his left hand on the gate rail which is swung open and which is shown directly below the man.</text>

            <text syncTime="3101.853" offset="12510751">With respect to the question of foreseeability, there was evidence in the record, specific testimony that a complaint had been made and the complaint had been made not about another pit or not about this pit but about the pits in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.180" offset="12572087">The question was asked of the mechanic whether or not he has made a complaint at a safety meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.214" offset="12596224">He said he has and he complained that the platform moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.998" offset="12611375">He happened to be working at another pit and incidentally the record indicates that the pits were all alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.416" offset="12637080">He happened to be working in another pit at the time he made the complaint and it was in that pit that the safety device was installed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.144" offset="12667904">Perhaps, if he had been working in this pit, the safe -- when the complaint was made, the safety device hadn't -- wouldn't have been installed in this pit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.207" offset="12696221">The pits were one right next to the other on three adjacent tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.529" offset="12713462">The question of whether or not the platform could move really depends on the distance between the flanges and this pedestal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.488" offset="12757347">That is how tightly does the flange gripped the pedestal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.984" offset="12771349">The photographs that Mr. Mountan discussed show the outside of the flange against the pedestal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.622" offset="12797889">There is nothing in the photograph which indicates whether or not there was a quarter of an inch between the flanges and the pedestals or two inches between the flanges and the pedestal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.973" offset="12839267">The respondent's foreman or the assistant foreman who testified said that it gripped it so that there was only a quarter of an inch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.879" offset="12870928">The petitioner and the mechanics said that it didn't grip it that tightly at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.845" offset="12886706">That there was about two inches and that the whole thing was not secured until it was raised up to the point where the wheels were attached to the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.902" offset="12918993">And then it was secured, and at that point there couldn't be any movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.959" offset="12935189">But it's not disputed that at this point, during this stage in the operation the wheels were not secured to the car and that the only thing that was limiting movement was these pedestals around the flange.</text>

            <text syncTime="3221.660" offset="12990046">Well, this is again arguing to the jury but I argue to the jury that you had an imbalance in pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.461" offset="13013243">There was evidence that the fact that the wheels when they raised -- would raised at an unequal rate so that the wheels on one side were raising or could raise at a speed higher than the wheels on the other side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.846" offset="13066742">That is -- that was the significance of that tipping in the crossbar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.838" offset="13082728">When the wheels were raised -- if the wheel on one side make some resistance, there will be a considerable pressure to the wheel on the other side to move up suddenly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.559" offset="13121599">And when the wheel on the other side moved up suddenly, the platform would shift a little bit to equalize that imbalance between the wheels, and that was what caused the -- that was -- nobody knows precisely what caused the platform to move.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.209" offset="13172172">That's what I argued to the jury and that's what the jury obviously accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.238" offset="13188368">The facts were all there to support that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.435" offset="13209161">A complaint had been made about this dangerous condition and something had been done but unfortunately not in this particular pit.</text>
