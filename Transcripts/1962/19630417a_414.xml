            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 414, Michael Shenker, petitioner, versus Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.961" offset="167267">Mr. Wright, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="18.024" offset="175417">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.692" offset="190151">This is an F. E. L. A. case in which the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed a judgment for the injured employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.867" offset="226826">It raises two questions; one, a question of federal appellate procedure, the other question of law as to the scope of the duty of the carrier under the Federal Employers' Liability Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.004" offset="275414">Since the two questions are independent, I should like to express my view on the procedural question before stating the facts which go to the merits and to the rule of law involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.215" offset="328182">In the Third Circuit, the judgment for the employee was reversed by vote of 2 to 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.264" offset="356394">Judge Goodrich and Judge Ganey with the majority and Judge Kalodner dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.542" offset="377501">A petition for rehearing en banc was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.595" offset="389726">The petition for rehearing en banc comes not under Rule 33 of the Third Circuit as respondent suggests in his brief and under Rule 4 (c) of the Third Circuit which deals with their en banc procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.694" offset="434134">The petition was ruled denied per Goodrich and Ganey J. with four justices dissenting from the denial of rehearing, Judge Kalodner, Judge Biggs, Judge Smith and Judge Staley.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.505" offset="493380">Judges Hasty and McLaughlin of the Third Circuit did not participate in ruling on the motion for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.297" offset="520547">And so as the matter stood, the vote was 4 to 2 in favor of granting rehearing but the statute, Section 46 (c) of the Judicial Code provides that rehearing en banc maybe ordered by a majority of the Circuit judges in active service.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.359" offset="584808">And since there were eight judges in active service on the court at that time, the court considered that the petition for rehearing had failed to attain the necessary majority and therefore it ruled that the petition was denied.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="134.617" offset="641860">Is there indication as to why two of the judges did not participate?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_alan_wright" startTime="137.341" stopTime="347.722">
            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="137.341" offset="652727">There's no indication whatever, Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.453" offset="669236">We concede that the -- a literal reading of the statute supports what was done below.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.891" offset="694941">It is true that there was not a majority of the Circuit judges in active service who voted to grant the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.791" offset="718555">We suggest, however, that this is a statute which had never been read literally either by this Court or any other court and it is a statute which read literally in this context, produces an absurd result.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.357" offset="772786">It produces the result that one loses though two-thirds of the judges who vote on the matter who voted in one's favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.872" offset="798908">I have endeavored, I must say without success to formulate some principle of one-judge-one-vote which might applicable to the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.525" offset="833494">I do suggest, however, that the principle of majority rule is not a principle confined to southern primaries, but it's one which the federal courts have always followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.448" offset="877171">I will not say that what happened below is unprecedented because there may always be a precedent which has been overlooked, but so far as I can find in following the work of the federal courts, I cannot recall any case in which a majority of the sitting judges have been held to not to have their way on a matter before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.806" offset="966614">The closest case I can think of in point as the case here of In re Isserman in which in order to show cause why Isserman should not be disbarred was served upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.635" offset="1005902">The Court divided 4 to 4 as to whether he had shown cause and this Court initially ruled that he'd failed to carry majority and he was disbarred.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.649" offset="1037981">But this Court then proceeded to change its rules to prevent such a result and on rehearing, permitted Isserman to remain a member of the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.972" offset="1083225">This Court when it first construed the en banc statute, Section 46 (c) indicated that a literal reading of the statute does not require, when it suggested specifically as a possible procedure which the Circuits might follow, that they might leave it to the original panel to decide whether or not a rehearing en banc should be called for.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.004" offset="1167339">If one does this, then two judges can order a rehearing en banc even though the statute says a majority of the judges in active service.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.994" offset="1203388">Now, if we can read the statute in a non-literal sense and permit the panel to decide, it is our view that we can also read the statute in a non-literal sense and permit those judges who participate to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.871" offset="1258872">When six judges participate or don't think rehearing should be granted that it would be entirely consistent with the purpose of the statute to order rehearing and in fact in my submission to deny rehearing on showing of this kind [Inaudible] the purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.096" offset="1327731">The statute we have been told is intended to make sure that a majority of the active judges may determine the major doctrinal trends for their Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.254" offset="1364407">Now this will not occur if -- when half of the judges in the Court and a majority of those participated are unsatisfied with the decision or want to hear more about it before they let it stand, to sit the doctrinal trends for their Circuit, nevertheless the decision has to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.524" offset="1441520">And it's for those reasons that we think that the court below erred when it entered its order rehearing denied with a vote of 4 to 2 to grant rehearing, the order should have been, rehearing granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.520" offset="1541413">Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart, it is that this Court has emphasized in Western Pacific case that the statute is addressed to the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.592" offset="1573700">Litigants may suggest the rehearing en banc but they get no vested rights from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.605" offset="1593762">At the same time, it seems to me that it is a matter of peculiar concern of the litigant when the resulting judgment comes, that the litigant is partly aggrieved by a judgment which we consider legally to be erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.765" offset="1646425">We do not believe that it is within the permissible discretion of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit to say that a minority should rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="562.646" offset="2353925">On the merits, the petitioner was a baggage man with Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, employed at its station in New Castle, Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.576" offset="2397706">At that point, the tracks of the Baltimore and Ohio and the tracks of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie are adjacent.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.922" offset="2423097">The Pittsburgh and Lake Erie has no employees at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.667" offset="2434069">It has a building but once a station, but as of the time when this accident occurred, Pittsburgh and Lake Erie passengers bought their tickets from the B&amp;O ticket agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.556" offset="2477641">And B&amp;O employees such as petitioner did what service was necessary for Pittsburgh and Lake Erie trains, including in this case, loading mail onto the train.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.796" offset="2518601">The petitioner was injured, a severe back injury requiring a laminectomy when a Pittsburgh and Lake Erie train, operating on Pittsburgh and Lake Erie tracks stopped, he endeavored to put the mail on, the door of the car would not open more than some 18 to 24 inches.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.858" offset="2590804">The sacks of mail are quite large, 31 by 37 inches and weighing up to 100 pounds and endeavoring to force these bags through the narrow opening, he injured his back.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.664" offset="2638033">There is, as I understand no dispute but that the car was defective in this regard and there was testimony that a P&amp;LE employee had earlier reported the defect to the P&amp;LE but that nothing had been done.</text>

            <text syncTime="730.936" offset="3027153">This was part of the duties which his employer had required him to perform.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.061" offset="3043662">The Court -- the majority of the Court of Appeals thought that this was a problem of agency of imputed negligence and it held that since the P&amp;LE was not the agent of the B&amp;O that there could be no imputation of any negligence at the P&amp;LE to the B&amp;O and therefore no recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.207" offset="3160168">Now, I take it that the parties are aggrieved as I read the brief, but this is not a proper approach of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.243" offset="3192351">At page 20 of his brief, respondent says that it wholeheartedly agrees with our formulation which states that there is no such agency issue or issue of imputed negligence here.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.591" offset="3233729">Our position is as simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.866" offset="3242820">We say we are concerned with negligence of the Pittsburgh and Lake Erie.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.656" offset="3257971">We are concerned only with negligence of the Baltimore and Ohio, petitioner's employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.515" offset="3277406">And we believe that here the Baltimore and Ohio was negligent.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.597" offset="3293811">That it breached its duty to provide -- reasonable care in providing a safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.283" offset="3324531">Now, respondent agrees also with us and the cases here, Bailey v. Central Vermont and Ellis v. Union Pacific certainly required this that there is such a duty on the employer-carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.601" offset="3377821">That the -- even when the employee is sent to work on the cars or track or equipment of another line that the employer is still under a continuing non-delegable duty to exercise reasonable care to see that the employee has a safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.980" offset="3443336">Thus far, we are on common ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.061" offset="3459636">Petitioner and respondent disagree however when we go beyond this to ask what this duty means in a concrete case.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.523" offset="3489416">Respondent analyzes cases and groups them and suggests that as a matter of law, the employer-carrier can be liable where the defect was not on his own premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.354" offset="3540825">Only if the employer had created the defect or had actual knowledge of the defect, or the defect was permanent or of such a long standing nature that he should have had knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.374" offset="3600906">This it seems to me is familiar and quite proper technique in case analysis that one can distinguish all the cases and find there has never been a case in which recovery has been allowed for a red-haired switchman killed in a head-on collision and clearly there can be no such recovery when that case arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.206" offset="3672168">I'm going to suggest that the law of negligence is too supple and too vital to be thus departmental on this, but before I discuss what seems to me the applicable principle I should like to say a word about the precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.946" offset="3727130">In order to develop the rule of law which respondent contends, it is necessary that they do some violence to the present, thus they are required to categorize a case in which the employee was injured because he fell in snow and ice as case of a permanent or long standing defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.134" offset="3807901">And to categorize similarly, a case in which a rainstorm, the night before had caused ashes to accumulate in an unhappy fashion which led to an accident, this they say are permanent or long standing defects.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.765" offset="3862444">At page 22 of their brief, they write off four of the precedents on the ground that these are cases like Sinkler v. Missouri Pacific, cases in which the third party was performing operational activities and therefore the negligence of the third party is to be imputed to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.879" offset="3926915">But this I suggest would come as a great surprise to the courts which decided there were four cases and three of them -- there is not a word of operational activities or of imputed negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.112" offset="3963800">And on the fourth, Mr. Hadden's case of a Payne v. Baltimore and Ohio, imputed negligence was clearly put forward only as an alternative ground of decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.094" offset="3999744">Finally, in connection with precedence, the categorization which respondent makes requires a somewhat heavy handed treatment if I may say so of Harris v. Pennsylvania Railroad which is the only case from this Court which comes close to the facts of our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.867" offset="4082813">In the Harris case, Harris was a Pennsylvania Railroad employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.583" offset="4105697">He was a member of a wreck crew and was sent out to help derail some cars which had -- to help re-rail some cars which have been derailed on the nickel plate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.472" offset="4141223">In the course of doing so, he slipped because of grease, so it was said on a nickel plate tie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.775" offset="4170480">There was no evidence in the record, whatever that the Pennsylvania Railroad or any employee of the Pennsylvania Railroad had any knowledge that the grease was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.587" offset="4213739">Nevertheless, it was held that there could be recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.911" offset="4223039">Now in the trial court, Harris alleged four grounds of negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.300" offset="4244564">But the jury found that Pennsylvania was negligent in only one ground, that there had been grease on the tie and this was not a reasonably safe place to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.097" offset="4283747">The Ohio Supreme Court announced that as a matter of Ohio procedure when the jury finds that a defendant is negligent on one ground and the same one as to others, this rejects the other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.870" offset="4338813">Because one of the other grounds had been that he can require to do this work, but then a Pennsylvania foreman in there and he said, “This is too hard a job for me” and the Pennsylvania foreman said, “You're a big boy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.131" offset="4375907">This has been a ground of negligence but the jury hadn't found it as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.606" offset="4389804">And the higher Supreme Court said, “We cannot consider this ground because the jury has impliedly rejected” and it also found insufficient evidence of grease and oil and reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.735" offset="4426271">The case came here and in the petition for certiorari, the first question put forward on behalf of Paris was that the Ohio Special Interrogatory Practice deprives workers of the rights under F. E. L. A. and should not be applicable in F. E. L. A. cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.907" offset="4486980">The second point put forward was that there was evidence to support the finding, the foreman shouldn't have made him do all this work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.417" offset="4509027">And finally, the point was made that there was evidence to support that the grease on the tie count.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.774" offset="4534418">This Court reversing the Ohio Supreme Court reinstating the verdict, expressly rested its decision that on a holding that there was sufficient evidence to find the employer negligent because of the grease and oil in the nickel plate tie and this Court expressly also said, “We therefore do not consider the challenge to the Ohio Interrogatory Practice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.908" offset="4611009">So that the explanation of Harris which my learned friend gives that for basis of liability there was that there was Pennsylvania foreman who knew about this is not the basis which prevailed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.580" offset="4661687">There's no evidence that the Pennsylvania foreman knew about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.934" offset="4675062">And my view to the Harris case in fact goes further than we are asking the Court to go here because in Harris there was no evidence even, so far as I can tell, that the railroad might plan an inspection and discover the grease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.770" offset="4734412">What happens -- there was whether the section man inspected the next morning and found no grease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.116" offset="4751862">Nevertheless, recovery was allowed in Harris.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.729" offset="4762311">Here, there is evidence that the defect had existed for some period of time sufficient for a court to have been made and most of this is not a new threat to safety but something which inspection by the Baltimore and Ohio would have disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.558" offset="4821556">Now, return from -- Yes?</text>

            <text syncTime="1380.514" offset="5625396">And this, I think is fully supported by the cases -- I agree that the cases are not from this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1401.988" offset="5711287">And this I think is what was meant when the trial judge charged the jury, that the employer's duty was to furnish employees with reasonably safe course, appliances, and equipment regardless of who owns them and where they might be located.</text>

            <text syncTime="1495.839" offset="6086719">And that is exactly what the railroad did or failed to do which is enough to impose liability on them, that the railroad took no precaution whatever.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alexander H. Hadden</label>
            <text syncTime="1618.904" offset="6578970">May it please the Court, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.195" offset="6596106">I should like at the outset to address a word or two to the rehearing, the alleged rehearing issue in this case and then I shall try to do as my opponent did to the secondly more important issue that of the merits of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.300" offset="6660577">To summarize the petitioner's position on the rehearing issue, it is in a nutshell list that notwithstanding the express statutory language which makes the ordering of rehearings dependent upon the affirmative vote of a majority of the full bench of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals, notwithstanding that requirement and in the light only of the fact that four out of the -- a total of eight justices or judges rather of the Third Circuit voted in favor of the rehearing en banc in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.912" offset="6783039">But on those facts not only was it not within the discretion of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals to deny rehearing but that it was an abuse of discretion to deny it and that on the vote -- on the favorable vote of a 4 to 2 majority, a rehearing should have been ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.420" offset="6853047">My opponent points to the Western Pacific case as authority for a non-literal interpretation of the language of Section 46 (c) and he says that under 46 -- under the Western Pacific case for example, it is -- it has been held that the majority of the Court of Appeals may delegate to the original three-man panel, the power to initiate the en banc procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.907" offset="6971016">Well, under the rules of the Third Circuit that is -- that -- the rule of the Third Circuit which is applicable here which he now points so is Rule 4 (c) of the Third Circuit expresses the rule of the Third Circuit in accordance with the -- almost verbatim language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.182" offset="7056071">It imposes upon the panel or rather the full consist of the Third Circuit, the responsibility to initiate en banc rehearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.951" offset="7111137">But he -- what my opponent fails to relate to the Court, however, is that the Western Pacific case did something in addition to authorizing the delegation of the power to the original three-man panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.038" offset="7163486">It in effect reposed upon the Courts of Appeals a very large discretion to fashion their own rules on the en banc hearing procedures in accordance with whatever reasonable procedures they might find convenient and it laid down the requirement only that once such procedures, such convenient and reasonable procedures have been adopted that they be expressed in a rule so that the mentioned bar -- the litigants as well know what the rule is, so that they can avail themselves of the procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.044" offset="7307577">My point is this that the Third Circuit has exercised its discretion as authorized to it under the Western Pacific case by following the statute literally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.059" offset="7347597">This Court has in a recent decision, the American Foreign Steamship Company case, a 1960 decision praised and I think an opinion by Justice Stewart praised the thorough machinery, administrative machinery worked out by the Court of Appeals and has held in fact that this is one of the Circuits where the procedure is best worked out and best known because of certain articles written by some of the judges.</text>

            <text syncTime="1897.272" offset="7692413">And I would say further that in connection with the basic purpose of the statute and the en banc procedure itself that does serve a valuable -- a valuable service in laying it rest the disputed questions as between perhaps raised panels of a given Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.527" offset="7761481">It, as my worthy opponent points out does establish for the Circuit, the major doctrinal trends of the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.303" offset="7788544">However, that purpose will not be served by ordering a rehearing to be held by something less than a full panel of bench.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.537" offset="7817488">One can conceive of a situation where if a six-judge panel out of a total of eight judges of that Circuit were to decide a case with two -- two judges absent for reasons which is like the present case are unexplained that those two judges might later return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.577" offset="7885720">These are likely to be cases which are close and controversial in any event and the result might later change and the -- their earlier decision be set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.164" offset="7932008">I would further say in connection with the rehearing aspect to this matter that the case had -- this case has now been admitted by this Court for a decision on both questions as I would understand it, certiorari not having been limited to one question or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.738" offset="7998360">I presume therefore, that the Court will reach and decide the questions so far as the merits of the case are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.503" offset="8029393">And if that is so, of course the question of rehearing becomes moot because any major doctrinal trends will have been established by this Court not only for the Third Circuit but for the entire country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.018" offset="8083414">I pass now to the question of the merits and I'll point out by way of preliminary in that connection that this case is not one of those many cases rising under the F. E. L. A. which involves nothing more than weighing of the evidence such as for example the case -- Sebastian case decided this Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.105" offset="8183829">This case is one where in effect the facts are almost stipulated because there's so little dispute about them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.064" offset="8219669">However, I think it is important that the Court have before it what the full facts are and I would like to supplement my brother's presentation in that regard without, however, suggesting that anything he has said is inaccurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.695" offset="8278183">This accident took place at the New Castle Station of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.020" offset="8303470">It is a station comprised of a building, with a waiting room, restaurants, ticket office where both B&amp;O and P&amp;LE tickets were sold, a baggage room, all of these in one building lying to the north of all the tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.254" offset="8360417">Then as we read to the right or to the south rather there were two Baltimore and Ohio tracks, eastbound, westbound separated by a platform.</text>

            <text syncTime="2987.433" offset="12053086">We would -- we have pointed out in our briefs and I should like to invite the attention of the Court now to the fact that our load of facts and evidence are quite skeletal as to the relationship between the two railroads at the time of the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.163" offset="12112018">There is an adequate basis we think for a jury issue of liability as to the P&amp;LE under the F. E. L. A.</text>

E. L. A.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.355" offset="12240750">Secondly, there's another line of decisions which maybe referred to as the loan servant doctrine, traditionally it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.780" offset="12282441">There's no question in this case but that the work being done by the petitioner at the time of his injury was work for the P&amp;LE.</text>

            <text syncTime="3424.073" offset="13799633">That would go towards contributory negligence but there's no finding in this case as to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.574" offset="13825651">And of course there's no assumption of risk in this case and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.095" offset="13839757">I was up doing those as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.086" offset="13855744">I'd like to close if I might by just addressing one word or two to what might be described as the policy aspect of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.857" offset="13890748">I think it -- probably my position in that regard is implicit to what's already been said it is that in order to justify the result in this case, this Court has got to extend the coverage of the Act of two situations not heretofore governed by any case including the Harris case as I read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.093" offset="13963786">Certainly, not the expressed terms of the Harris case, don't cover this fact situation and I think it's enough to say that if it is so extended, this Court has perhaps occupied appeal which is more appropriate occupied by the Congress of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="3491.949" offset="14071202">I was surprised by counsel's suggestion that the charge to the jury in his view did not state the correct test of legal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.822" offset="14110699">As is already been mentioned, there was no exception taken to the charge by either side of the conclusion of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.881" offset="14138911">The trial judge said, “Gentlemen, have I misstated anything?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.018" offset="14151450">Counsel for the defendant said, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.279" offset="14164511">This afternoon in this Court is his -- the first suggestion I've heard, the charge was inaccurate or the judge did not give a quick test of legal liability to the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3528.347" offset="14216756">Mr. Justice Brennan, I wouldn't think that the appeals did -- much chance of success.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.985" offset="14235355">I appreciate Mr. Hadden's willingness to spell out legal arguments by which it might have been found to be an employee of the P&amp;LE but this argument seemed to me not at all firmly based.</text>

            <text syncTime="3549.957" offset="14303169">Well, in any event the reason in appeal was not taken was that you thought was not meritorious?</text>

            <text syncTime="3554.647" offset="14321977">Yes, I think -- we did not think it would win.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.508" offset="14333367">We think that an employee does not need to rely on such as [Inaudible] as the loan servant doctrine or the operational activities doctrine that he is entitled to look to his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.364" offset="14384880">Employer sends him some place else and he's hurt, his employer should pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.034" offset="14411525">Finally, I'm strongly tempted by Mr. Hadden's invitation that I stand up here and say what the Baltimore and Ohio could have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.449" offset="14449142">As an interested student of the railroads, I would enjoy telling the Baltimore and Ohio would've -- could've done but I think it knows much better than I what might have been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.112" offset="14491773">It certainly could have inspected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.756" offset="14502431">It could have had a supervisory employee there who -- when he heard the P&amp;LE baggage man say this door won't open.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.490" offset="14529285">I've tried to get it fixed and it hasn't been fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.444" offset="14537122">He could've said, “Shenker, no, do not work on this car.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.204" offset="14552168">It could have issued instructions to its employees that they were not required to service equipment which was found to be defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.055" offset="14583620">Now, if the – if the duty here is a hard one on the Baltimore and Ohio, it seems to me that that is the risk it takes when it sends its employee elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.788" offset="14622490">It's quite obviously as in a better position to control the condition of its own cars in its own premises than it is there is of another carrier, but it assumes that risk when it enters into some arrangement we know not what to service the other carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.904" offset="14682990">And so, in my view, the correct principle is that it was stated by the Sixth Circuit on the case of Payne v. Baltimore and Ohio, where it said when the employer delegates its duty or abdicates its control, the employer takes the risk, not the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.357" offset="14740773">It seems to me that here, if there was a risk involved and it was hard for the B&amp;O but that's just what the B&amp;O asked for.</text>
