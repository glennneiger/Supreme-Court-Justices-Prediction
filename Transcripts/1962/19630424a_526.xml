            <text syncTime="26.779" offset="211550">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.738" offset="219387">This case is here on appeal from the Supreme Court of South Carolina, probable jurisdiction was noted December 17, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.929" offset="264108">The question presented in essence is whether a Seventh-day Adventist observing the Saturday Sabbath from Friday evening at sundown to Saturday evening at sundown maybe required to work on Saturday under penalty of loss upon employment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.460" offset="358254">The basic question is whether the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment guaranteeing the free exercise of religion is violated by the South Carolina Unemployment Compensation Act as here construed and applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.523" offset="442472">The pertinent facts are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.025" offset="452504">The appellant, age 57 had been employed as a school tender for about approximately 35 years, and since 1938 steadily in the plant of Spartan Mills at Spartanburg, South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.699" offset="515197">From World War II, its Saturday work had been on a voluntary basis and appellant was required to work only five days a week, Monday through Friday.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.740" offset="571308">She worked on the first shift from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.679" offset="599103">On August 6, 1957, she became a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.462" offset="634211">The religious teaching of that church is that the Sabbath for the worship of God commanded by him commences at sundown, Friday evening and ends at sundown, Saturday evening.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.165" offset="689068">Without incident after her joining the Seventh-day Adventist Church and for approximately 22 months, she continued in the same regular employment until June 5, 1959, when the employer posted notice that thereafter work on Saturday would be mandatory as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.095" offset="788752">After the notice was posted, she explained to her employer that her religion would not permit her to work on Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.335" offset="833787">No relief was given to her and she was absent from work for six successive Saturdays and was then discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.118" offset="864820">She admittedly applied for unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.432" offset="882166">The pertinent sections of the state law are set out in our gray-covered brief at pages 3 and 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.467" offset="910273">This statute is substantially the same as that found in most of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.638" offset="934933">Section 68-113 (3) requires it to be initially eligible for compensation benefits, the claimant must be able to work and available for work.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.004" offset="984461">The claims examiner held her not available for work because she was unwilling to work on Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.113" offset="1012882">Section 68-114 provides that even though initially eligible for benefits, the claimant maybe disqualified for misconduct conduct -- connected with her most recent work.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.473" offset="1066277">And on that further ground, the same examiner held her disqualified for five weeks because of her unexcused absences.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.689" offset="1107132">I might say that this as applied in this case means simply that the payment of the benefits which can total to 22 weeks or deferred was deferred for five weeks and the examiner did not purport to apply a forfeiture of the five weeks of pay unemployment benefits which might have been imposed in a case that he felt was flagrant enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="298.222" offset="1297304">Connected with her work, that’s right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.944" offset="1316216">It appeared that the appellant had applied at three other textile mills shortly after her discharge, but found that they were on a six-day basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.380" offset="1357908">The record shows that most of the textile plants operate on a six-day basis, but this record also shows a curious case of growth of that fraction most.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.466" offset="1418303">The referee on appeal said practically all of the textile plants operate on a six-day basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.552" offset="1454561">The Commission said all.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.115" offset="1464905">The Court of Common Pleas said all, and when it got to the Supreme Court of South Carolina, we having taken the specific exemption to that finding because of the record showing most, the Supreme Court said that the Commission had found all operate on a six-day basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.833" offset="1543690">I call the attention of that because it is significant in the light of the other circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.668" offset="1571067">In any event, the applicant was on an apparently very little wage because the record shows that her benefits, if paid, would have been limited to $26 per week.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.006" offset="1616415">And under the South Carolina law, this is usually taken to approximate half of the average weekly wage.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.927" offset="1656121">She stated in the hearing before the referee that she was willing to work and able to work, in any mill or in any other industry so long as the job was a decent job, and so long as it did not require her to work on her Sabbath.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.354" offset="1737832">The evidence is also un-contradicted in this record that of the 150 members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Spartanburg, all are gainfully employed and none experience any particular difficulty in obtaining jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.015" offset="1820484">We think the record is clear that the appellant did not remove herself from the labor market in that area by her refusal to work on the Sabbath.</text>

            <text syncTime="451.858" offset="1911808">The claim examiner's decision was affirmed by the referee by the State Unemployment Compensation Commission and by the Common Pleas Court of Spartanburg County.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.193" offset="1953186">The State Supreme Court apparently conceded that “available for work” the classic phrase means available for suitable work.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.825" offset="1999684">In 1955, the law of South Carolina had been amended to provide specifically in determining whether or not any work is suitable for an individual, the Commission shall consider the degree of risk involved to his health, safety, and morals.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.124" offset="2080872">The Court, however, held that this Amendment merely referred to work, the character of which would be morally objectionable to any employee, and therefore, excluded the contention there made by the appellant that consideration and application of that Amendment would require recognition that to require her to work on Saturday would be violative and -- of her religion and carry with it a grave threat to her morals and by reason of that fact would exonerate her from this requirement.</text>

            <label>Mr. William D. Donnelly</label>
            <text syncTime="596.739" offset="2491308">No, they did not consider as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.848" offset="2507818">It was for this reason that the decisions in the Supreme Court of Ohio in Tary against Board of Review and In re Miller in 243, North Carolina, later of which incidentally did involved mill work where it held not applicable by the state of -- the Supreme Court of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.776" offset="2595485">n essence, the Court concluded, “the purpose of the available for work test is to determine whether the claimant is actually and currently attached to the labor market.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.256" offset="2649401">That is to say whether or not she was offering a service for which there was a demand and which was being supplied in that area, whether or not, that there was a job open that would require her services at that time because of course, the law contemplates the compensation for those who are unemployed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="658.389" offset="2737904">Curiously, the Court went on to say, however, that the test in determining whether or not she's attached to the labor market is unrestricted availability.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.094" offset="2792761">Later on in opinion they said, but this doesn't mean on Sunday, but I'll come to that later.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.136" offset="2816899">Curiously, the Court made no further reference to the fact that there was a market for the appellant services.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.394" offset="2845947">The -- it does not refer to the fact that all other Seventh-day Adventists were able to obtain positions without difficulty and were all gainfully employed and it ignores that point completely in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.730" offset="2903312">The state court, instead, held that by adhering to the Seventh-day Adventist Decree, the appellant had rendered herself unable or unwilling to work in her usual trade or occupation for the usual and customary number of days or hours and had restricted her willingness to work to periods that fit her own personal circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.688" offset="3007175">The resort to both those phrases apparently was occasioned by the fact that they had been used in other circumstances by other state courts in rejecting claims to compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.825" offset="3063704">Because of this, the Court concluded that she was not available for work.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.465" offset="3086273">As to the disqualification to which Mr. Justice Goldberg referred, they quite made a minor shift and said that she was disqualified not for misconduct connected with her work but failure to accept without good cause, available suitable work offered to her by her employer, referring to the fact that the employer was quite willing to keep her on if she were willing to work on Saturdays.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.177" offset="3201108">As to the constitutional right to the free exercise of religion, the Court held that the law had placed no restriction of right to observe her religious beliefs in accordance with her own conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.979" offset="3256278">She was completely free to do as she pleased in other words.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.046" offset="3272579">The only trouble was, she would lose the right to the compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.718" offset="3299224">The dissent noted, as the record clearly shows, that she had made no change in the days or hours of her usual work and that her loss of the job was occasioned by the change of the employer in shifting over to the six-day week.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.035" offset="3372575">Of course, if we can refer back to what happened 22 months before and say that she changed her religion, then yes, indirectly and remotely, her change was occasioned for her being discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.559" offset="3438613">Now, free exercise of religion, as we conceive it, means exercise free of sanctions or penalties that influence or compel the person to profess her belief or disbelief in any religion, or to do an act repugnant to his religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.168" offset="3525026">Relying on the language of Mr. Justice Jackson in the Barnett case, we first start with the proposition here that in requiring this applicant to express a willingness to work on Saturday, she was being required to express and profess an attitude of mind in conflict with her religious beliefs sincerely held.</text>

            <text syncTime="1135.646" offset="4646933">Now the appellee relies chiefly as I understand your argument upon the contention that in the Braunfeld case, the Sunday law cases, this question was already decided that this is an indirect burden and falls with it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1154.699" offset="4723210">I still lack the language in the Braunfeld case because in this case, it cannot rightly be asserted that there is any indirect pressure because there, in distinguishing the Flag Salute case, this Court pointed out the statute before us does not make criminal, the holding of any religious belief or opinion nor does it force anyone to embrace any religious belief or to say or believe anything in conflict with these religious tenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.085" offset="4844732">Or as Mr. Justice Brennan considered in his dissent, the distinction was based on the fact the laws do not say that appellants must work on Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.757" offset="4883393">Now here, if we concede that the imposition of a criminal penalty or a fine as in the Sunday law cases is equivalent to or equaled by the penalty imposed by the withholding of the unemployment benefit, then I submit that here, we have a direct penalty and the direct burden because the individual is left with no intermediate choice such as it was brought in the Sunday law cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1459.525" offset="5942502">The unemployment laws recognize that there would be dislocation industrially and economically resulting in involuntary unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.322" offset="5993702">The line that has been drawn by the Supreme Court of South Carolina and by, I think a majority of the other states, with respect to questions similar to that presented here is this, that if the unemployment is brought about as a result of economic or industrial dislocation, then it is compensable, but it is brought about by something that is personal to the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.233" offset="6097356">Some personal action that does not come within the scope of the statute or the administrative construction of the statute, then it is not compensable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.620" offset="6130897">That can be illustrated by a number of cases, one of which has been before the Supreme Court of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.135" offset="6152944">For instance a workman or a worker having to care for children, having to care for sick husband, a very laudable purpose that one requires that she not be at her job, but nevertheless in circumstances such as that, compensation is denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.466" offset="6226296">That has been decided by the Supreme Court of South Carolina and by a number of all state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.557" offset="6246672">Cases involving the cessation of work by a wife when her husband has been transferred away from the site of her employment; she may form religious or other reasons to be compelled to be by the side of her husband but nevertheless that is not held to be a suitable ground for ceasing work and in that case, unemployment benefits are withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.453" offset="6338205">An exception is made to some extent administratively in South Carolina with respect to cessation of work by reason of pregnancy up through a certain stage of the pregnancy period benefits are payable, beyond that, there are none.</text>

            <text syncTime="3408.889" offset="13739948">(1) If the position offered is vacant due directly to strike, blackout, or other labor dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3439.877" offset="13863873">I happen to know about this Section, Your Honor because I thought it was somewhat ironical, that the individual could not be deemed to be offered suitable work if it required him to resign from a union, but under the interpretation of the South Carolina Court, he is offered suitable work though his work would require him to work on a Saturday and in effect to resign from his church.</text>

            <text syncTime="3521.759" offset="14191449">I don't believe it has application for here, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.127" offset="14208899">For example, a number of states -- I've cited them in the brief, three of them, at least have held that their statute does not require the Seventh-day Adventist to work on Saturday and there is not -- have been deemed to be any conflict in that construction with the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.893" offset="14283922">So the federal statute still remains in full force and effect unaffected by the construction which we suggest is necessary to comply with the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3572.944" offset="14396144">There's only one other point that I wanted to mention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.955" offset="14408265">The peculiar Sunday law that was a subject of the discussion earlier is referred to at record 48 by the Court as the reason for accepting the requirement of working on Sunday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.838" offset="14463749">It's significant that they did not rely on the general Sunday law prohibiting work on Sunday by an individual and I speculate, but I think the reference to the statute will show that this was done because within a month, before the decision of the Supreme Court of South Carolina, the general Sunday law prohibition had been amended radically to provide that many types of work were permissible on Sunday under the impact of the decision in the Sunday law cases and a threat that the old statute was going to be enforced very rigidly.</text>
