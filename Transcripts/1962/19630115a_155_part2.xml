            <text syncTime="7.868" offset="135899">Mr. Justice Black, I do not believe that there has been any retrogression at all in any of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.677" offset="167142">There is a difference of opinion as to some of the statutes in cases that you cite.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.191" offset="205176">Research in this field is very difficult and there are differences of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.862" offset="243837">I believe that in Professor Kamisar's article which has just been published in Chicago Law Review, a companion case in the Michigan Law Review, there is a discussion of your footnote and some criticism of some of the citations.</text>

            <label>Mr. Abe Fortas</label>

            <text syncTime="57.336" offset="333699">Now, actually here is the position as well as I understand it in Betts against Brady, in the majority opinion of -- in the Court's opinion, the following is stated quote, “In the great majority of the States, it has been the considered judgment of the people, their representatives and their Courts that appointment of counsel is not a fundamental right essential to a fair trial and in the majority opinion there are citations and analysis.”</text>
            <text syncTime="88.338" offset="457728">Now, in your own opinion, Mr. Justice Black, on page 477, footnote 2, I think it is, you say in 35 States, there is some clear legal requirement or an established practice.</text>

            <label>Mr. Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="106.303" offset="529617">Now, this -- could we just hold that a minute?</text>
            <text syncTime="111.657" offset="551037">The intervening point I want to make is that in 1961 in McNeal against Culver, Mr. Justice Douglas, appended a list of 35 States which were, had such provisions by Constitution, statute, court rule or judicial decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.908" offset="635988">That was in 35 States in 1961, which shows a growth in the number.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.238" offset="665349">Now, since the list compiled by Mr. Justice Douglas there have been two others, Colorado and Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.662" offset="698995">You'll find that on page 29 of our brief, which makes 37 States that by Constitution, court rule, statute or judicial decision make the appointment of counsel for indigents in the state criminal prosecutions, at least in felony cases, compulsory.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.278" offset="789483">Now, in addition --</text>

            <label>Justice Hugo L. Black</label>
            <text syncTime="171.575" offset="790737">And my figure was limited to felony or penitentiary offenses.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="abe_fortas" startTime="174.956" stopTime="244.302">
            <label>Mr. Abe Fortas</label>
            <text syncTime="174.956" offset="804216">Some of them are.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.816" offset="807664">There are about 20 or more that include misdemeanors, of those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.224" offset="833264">Now, in addition to those 37, there are eight States which have a practice, a general practice -- not invariable, but a general practice of appointing counsel in state felony prosecutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.060" offset="920618">They are listed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.422" offset="930126">That would bring you up to a total of 45.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.031" offset="944546">Now, the remaining five, as I pointed out in my argument -- Florida, for example, by statute and apparently by practice -- by statute in the case of two counties and by practice in the case of two others, has a public defender system.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.295" offset="1013614">And a recent study made by the American Bar Association Foundation of the workings of that system in those selected counties in Florida, it shows that the public defender system is extensively utilized.</text>

            <text syncTime="713.961" offset="2960259">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the amici urge the Court to reconsider Betts against Brady and overrule it.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.581" offset="3030685">We have carefully examined the federal question and we do think that is the heart of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.880" offset="3063912">But in the examination of that question, we think you have to start back to the Fourth -- with the Fourteenth Amendment and the question of due process and equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.114" offset="3124830">And we think that the error in Betts against Brady is the basic assumption that you can have a fair trial in the ordinary circumstances where you do not have special circumstances without a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.167" offset="3201108">There is where we think the error in Betts against Brady is, and that's where it needs to be corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.383" offset="3237888">Now, it's our position that the judges of this country, including this Court and all the other judges, have a special responsibility concerning this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.257" offset="3297447">And right along with that is the responsibility of lawyers, because the layman doesn't know this problem like we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.472" offset="3342273">This is the judges' and the lawyers' problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.657" offset="3363067">We deal with these intricate questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.409" offset="3382084">We're here before this bench from time to time with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.560" offset="3402668">All that was involved, for instance, in Mapp against Ohio, the coerced confession, the question of whether or not there has been discrimination in the selection of a grand jury or petit jury, the right to cross-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.826" offset="3483752">And then Betts against Brady assumes that the layman knows enough to present those arguments on his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.751" offset="3523354">Now, in most cases, we should be the ones, we of the bar at least, and I think the courts know it just as well as we do because they observe it day by day.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.037" offset="3568494">It just isn't true that the layman knows those rules of law, and if he does happen to hear about them, he doesn't know how to express them and represent himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.414" offset="3626068">Well, that's what's wrong with Betts against Brady and it is time, long passed, that our profession should stand up and say, we know because of our day by day experience that the ordinary layman can't get a fair trial, either in the federal courts where it's corrected or in thestate courts of this country where he represents himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.571" offset="3742678">Just imagine all of the rules that the lawyer has to deal with to represent a client properly, from the moment he was first consulted, in the ordinary criminal case, and then imagine the layman trying to follow that track, find the cases, find the distinctions between one case and another, and applying them.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.893" offset="3883948">Now, it would be bad enough for us of the profession to say that you could have a fair trial under those circumstances, knowing what we do with regard to the ordinary layman without counsel, but we also know that on the other side of the case, whether it's the Government of the United States, which you are particularly familiar with and I am, who has skilled counsel that tried hundreds of cases, or whether it's a state prosecutor with his vast experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.476" offset="4074329">It is enough of a fiction to be able to claim that the ordinary lawyer, with the greatest diligence and skill, is able to present fairly a case on behalf of a defendant against this skilled prosecutor that's had hundreds of cases behind him and understands the reaction of the Court, in addition to knowing right off every case that could have a bearing upon the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.335" offset="4233780">But when you take the poor layman and put him against those odds, there isn't the remotest possibility that you can get a fair trial except by pure accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.593" offset="4302744">Now, how does it affect the federal situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.536" offset="4318521">In the first place, if you assume that you can't have a fair trial in the ordinary case, then I contend that the Fourteenth Amendment does not permit the States to have unfair trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.056" offset="4384664">I don't think there'd be any question about that with this Court, any member of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1921.372" offset="7789881">Now, there are a number of contentions by the respondent in regard to emptying the jails that I would like to deal with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.556" offset="7846619">On page 55, they present a number of cases in which they show the large number of persons who are incarcerated and what the effect would be of this rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2066.108" offset="8368859">And if they haven't had a fair trial, they ought to have one fair trial in regard to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.304" offset="8389653">Now, in Johnson against Zerbst, this same argument was made, if you will recall, in the Government's brief, and Attorney General Homer Cummings was not sympathetic with the idea of not having counsel because of, I'm sure, because of some remarks he made independently.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.812" offset="8471677">But the Government did present a brief in which it was trying to support the position and presented all they could on behalf of not having counsel in federal cases, and it was urged that it would empty the jails, as one of the arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.636" offset="8542939">And the Court treated that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.563" offset="8554642">It wasn't frightened by it as apparently (Inaudible) by the Government's brief, but it did deal with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.075" offset="8584735">And it said that of course there is a presumed regularity about judgments that would have to be dealt with, but it proceeded to recognize that Johnson against Zerbst could be applied retrospective regardless of that in terrorem argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.539" offset="8674597">And there is a considerable argument here about, by the respondent, about the application of Mapp against Ohio, and some of the cases as explained by counsel, I don't think are quite completely revealed to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.667" offset="8751083">Now, in the State of New York, the Court of Appeals took the position that Mapp against Ohio would be applied by it in all cases where the court had not disposed of an appeal, even though Mapp against Ohio was not in effect at the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.225" offset="8841258">And Judge Foley, in the United States District Court, in several cases dealt with that problem and said that in regard to federalism, recognizing the problem, that the States should be given, particularly in a State like New York where the Court of Appeals had been advanced in consideration of such matters, to examine the problem in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.008" offset="8940419">But he didn't in any way say that Mapp against Ohio would not be applied if the state courts did not properly examine the question to see whether it should be applied in particular cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.941" offset="8996112">Now, there'd be many cases, of course, where the defendant, the prisoner, would decide that he didn't want, after serving a period of time, to have his case opened and see whether he would get a greater sentence or something else happen to him, many of them would be disposed in that -- of in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.149" offset="9076987">Others would be disposed of by the conclusion that they, after considering the entire matter, didn't care to have them reopened any way, and that would get down to some kind of hard core that would depend upon whether they did have a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.195" offset="9149189">And in those cases, when it's shown that they didn't have counsel and they didn't have a fair trial because they didn't have counsel but it would be obvious to ask for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.112" offset="9196837">Now, it seems to me that in the interests of society they should go back and reexamine to see that they did have a fair hearing at one time in regard to the charges against them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2417.901" offset="9776024">The Florida Supreme Court does not stand on formalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.160" offset="9793055">Any scrap of paper which comes to its attention which alleges any facts whatsoever that raise a constitutional issue or raise a probable cause question as to whether that defendant is legally or illegally held, it is treated as a petition for habeas corpus by the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.256" offset="9889395">Of course, if the petition does not have -- does not raise any justiciable issue whatsoever, the court denies the petition on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.472" offset="9926280">If a justiciable issue is raised, the court will issue a writ and require our office, the Office of the Attorney General, to file a return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.524" offset="9970479">In right to counsel cases, when the question of denial of counsel is raised by a petition, it is our policy in the Attorney General's Office to attach a transcript of the trial proceedings to show the court or give the court a chance to look at the trial proceedings to determine whether or not the defendant received a fair trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="3017.625" offset="12174900">Before getting into the argument on Betts versus Brady, I'd like to briefly outline our argument on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.044" offset="12196530">First of all, I'm going to point out that historically, there is no basis whatsoever for including the right to automatic appointment of counsel in noncapital cases in the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.667" offset="12255044">Secondly, I'd like to indicate to the Court that due process, the term “due process,” as it has been developed by this Court in many cases since the Civil War, is a relative and not an absolute concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.808" offset="12319619">And therefore, this Court cannot impose an inflexible rule requiring appointment in all felony cases or in all criminal cases, for that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.772" offset="12371446">Next, I'll discuss the question of federalism and attempt to show the Court that imposition of an inflexible rule in this area would be an unwarranted intrusion into historic rights of the States to determine their own rules of criminal procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.568" offset="12442708">I'll also point out that although the majority of the States now do provide for automatic appointment in cases less than capital, the States that do that do so by court rule and by statute and not by constitutional construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.203" offset="12521179">In fact, there are only about 11 cases -- about 11 jurisdictions that I can count that have required the appointment of counsel in cases less than capital as an automatic, fundamental requirement under their constitutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3178.261" offset="12817408">And so far as the injury to federalism is concerned, injury to the States, one of my objections to Betts and Brady has been just that that the State's entitled to know with some degree of certainty what they can do to comply with what this Court says the Constitution requires.</text>

            <text syncTime="4737.360" offset="19053881">For instance, if we required that all -- that counsel be appointed in all cases as a necessary requisite of equal protection, the courts or the States would also be required to appoint counsel in civil cases because a man who has money can be represented by a lawyer in civil cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4758.521" offset="19138518">The court would have to see to it that a man is given investigators, that he's given psychiatrists and expert witnesses if he wants them, because those things are available to the man who has money.</text>
            <text syncTime="4770.425" offset="19186061">This Court would have to see to it that every man is equally entitled to bail, that the State would have to give him money for bail if he couldn't afford it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.755" offset="19223468">This Court would have to require that all States provide for a lawyer on appeal or in post-conviction proceedings or on appeals from post-conviction proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.927" offset="19268086">In effect, the Court would be requiring that the States follow a program of socialism or would be requiring that the States adopt a welfare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.315" offset="19317614">And the States, we feel, should be allowed to adopt that program themselves if they want to, but that it should not be required as a constitutional requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.143" offset="19360977">Griffin versus Illinois does not constitute grounds for making this a right under the Equal Protection Clause for making the absolute right to counsel a requirement under the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.934" offset="19428164">In Griffin, the Court said that a state cannot discriminate if they provide for transcripts -- if they provide that no one can receive an adequate appeal without a transcript, they cannot bar the door of the courtroom, so to speak, by requiring that a poor man pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.972" offset="19492321">It's just as though they closed the door on him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.360" offset="19505800">Under the Betts versus Brady doctrine, a man's -- the door of the courtroom may be closed if a man is deaf and dumb or if he is illiterate or ignorant or if he's incapable of handling his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.145" offset="19548954">But if he is capable of handling his own defense, the door to the courtroom is not closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.555" offset="19570584">Also, Griffin points out that a state does not have to give the indigent the exact same treatment which the rich man is able to afford.</text>
            <text syncTime="4877.526" offset="19614469">Mr. Justice Black said that the State, if it wished, would not have to always supply transcripts in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4884.569" offset="19642681">It could find other ways to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4886.179" offset="19649160">In other words, as long as it substantially gives a man the same protection that a rich man is given, that is all that is required under the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4895.734" offset="19687299">And we contend that a man does get substantial protection if he's competent enough to handle his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.273" offset="19721467">Now, counsel for petitioner has said that the imposition of an inflexible rule in all noncapital cases or in all criminal cases would create less -- would mean that there would be less friction between the federal courts and the state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4920.335" offset="19785728">Justice Brandeis once said that separation of powers was adopted in the Constitution not to promote efficiency but to preclude the exercise of arbitrary power.</text>
            <text syncTime="4931.831" offset="19831704">Even if there is some friction created between federal and state courts, it is better to have that friction than to allow the federal courts to substitute their opinions on what States should require under their state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.752" offset="19891367">In their briefs, the petitioner and the amici have pointed out that if an inflexible rule is adopted, there will be much fewer -- there will be fewer petitions in this Court, fewer habeas corpus petitions, fewer petitions for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.381" offset="19957927">That position is a fantasy because first of all, if an inflexible rule is set down by this Court and it is made retroactive, immediately, the state courts and this Court will be flooded with a number of petitions from prisoners who have been incarcerated for a number of years.</text>

            <text syncTime="5088.492" offset="20458329">For instance, a newspaper article this Sunday pointed out that there has been great difficulty in procuring lawyers to handle all of these defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="5099.568" offset="20502632">Just because a system is imposed does not mean that there won't be many difficulties in getting counsel to undertake that system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5109.139" offset="20540980">As to this matter of retroactivity, or making this decision retroactive, logically, the decision would have to be retroactive because Gideon filed a petition for habeas corpus, which is a collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="5122.942" offset="20596151">So if this Court were to reverse the case and impose an inflexible rule in all criminal cases, as I pointed out in our brief, approximately 5,200 prisoners would be at least eligible to be set free under the new rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="5504.314" offset="22121702">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5508.689" offset="22139152">In company with Florida, Alabama and North Carolina are of the opinion that Betts versus Brady should not be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="5520.399" offset="22185963">Regrettably, my presentation will in many areas duplicate that of Mr. Jacob, but fortunately, I'll be brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.729" offset="22227341">We contend that the Sixth Amendment providing for representation by counsel in criminal prosecutions operates only on the Federal Government that state appointment of counsel, in and of itself, is not an essential to a fair trial that an asserted denial of due process should be tested by an appraisal of the totality of facts in a given case and that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause does not make the Sixth Amendment applicable to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5568.607" offset="22378851">Now, I candidly admit that along with other forms of public assistance for indigent persons, it would be desirable for the States to furnish counsel in all criminal prosecutions, but we contend that there is no need for appointment of counsel in every state prosecution and that each individual state should have the privilege of exercising its constitutional right under the Tenth Amendment of determining when appointment is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5600.214" offset="22505284">We say that it's a sound rule that an asserted denial of due process is to be tested by an appraisal of the totality of the facts in a given case and that a constitutional violation occurs only where the failure to appoint counsel constitutes a denial of fundamental fairness which is shocking to the universal sense of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5625.580" offset="22606744">The petitioner in this case has asserted that from 75% to 90% of all state cases are decided on pleas of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5638.267" offset="22657421">In accepting as valid those statistics, we say that it is unrealistic to assume that anything more than a very few of those pleas result from the accused ignorance or fear or from any improper influence by state authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5656.444" offset="22730146">Practically, everyone who pleads guilty to a criminal charge does so because he knows that the prosecuting authorities can prove his guilt and because he hopes to obtain leniency by dispensing with an unnecessary trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5673.222" offset="22797333">And we say that a state should not be burdened with the expense of appointing an attorney who in good conscience could recommend only to his client that he enter a plea of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5688.848" offset="22859818">Now, as critics complain that in the 20 years following Betts versus Brady, this Court has been compelled to reverse more and more state cases, indicating a necessity for overruling Betts versus Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="5705.218" offset="22925228">We don't deny that this Court has observed some cases which have shocked its sense of justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="6442.860" offset="25875811">But I mean there are certain areas in which he gives, that -- which he wouldn't do if there was an adversary counsel representing the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6456.670" offset="25931086">I've talked -- at the last meeting of the bar association, when I talked to a group of the state solicitors and they were of the widespread agreement that an indigent appearing without aid of counsel really stood a better chance of getting a lighter sentence or even an outright acquittal than one who does have an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="6484.149" offset="26041010">And I think one reason for that is this that the prosecuting attorney feels free to pull out all the stops if he's got an opponent and the average opponent, at least in Alabama, the average lawyer there is just not sufficiently versed in criminal practice to cope with most of your career prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="6514.045" offset="26160546">I just mention these things to demonstrate that generally speaking, indigents charged with crime are not as unfortunately situated as the critics of Betts versus Brady would have us believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="6532.133" offset="26232957">Another thing, I think that since Betts versus Brady there's been a progression in the education of most groups and I believe that if the average man who has got a real valid defense is sufficiently articulate enough to get it across to the jury -- he may not do it in the nice legal niceties, but he gets the story across.</text>

            <text syncTime="6588.020" offset="26456461">And this, of course, raises the problem of whether the protection of counsel should be limited to felonies or to misdemeanors or to whatever terms we're going to use these different offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="6604.332" offset="26521767">Because certainly an illegal sentence of, I think, 30 days is just as much a violation of due process as one for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="6616.345" offset="26569728">Another thing is why should we limit it to criminal prosecutions?</text>
            <text syncTime="6623.930" offset="26600135">The Due Process Clause protects property, so it seems just as logical that if you say the Fourteenth Amendment requires appointment of counsel in criminal cases, it also requires appointment of counsel in civil cases where property is involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="7153.750" offset="28719397">As to the capital/noncapital distinction, I think that this Court itself has demonstrated that that distinction is untenable as a constitutional matter, and nowhere has that been better stated than in the court martial cases which we have analyzed, because of their remarkable pertinence here, in Appendix C to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="7183.850" offset="28839769">And I would like to say, to quote again from Mr. Justice Clark's dissenting opinion in the first case -- in the second court martial case he wrote the opinion of the Court -- in the first court martial case Mr. Justice Clark said, for the dissenters, for himself and Mr. Justice Burton, that the dissenting Justices could “find no distinction in the Constitution between capital and other cases.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7212.933" offset="28956170">And that, of course, I believe has always been the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="7217.498" offset="28974352">I think that Betts against Brady was wrong when decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="7223.494" offset="28998384">I think time has illuminated that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="7226.841" offset="29011759">But I think that perhaps time has also done a service, because time has prepared the way so that the rule, the correct rule, the civilized rule, the rule of American constitutionalism, the rule of due process, may now be stated by this Court with minimum irritation and disruption in the States.</text>

            <text syncTime="7323.426" offset="29398058">And we have cited in our brief very shortly a passage that I found -- I'm sure a lot of other people have found it, too -- in Blackstone, in which Blackstone points out, is extremely critical of the English restriction on counsel, and points out that so onerous and so irritating was the restriction on the right of counsel that the English judges developed a practice of permitting counsel to stand at the side of the accused and tell the accused what to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="7360.729" offset="29547269">And it is that omission that I find in Mr. Justice Roberts' opinion.</text>
