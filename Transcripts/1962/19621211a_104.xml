            <label>Mr. William Gural</label>
            <text syncTime="37.224" offset="252217">Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.204" offset="284191">This case comes here on appeal from a judgment of a three-judge statutory court, which reversed a determination by the Interstate Commerce Commission, that determination would be the lack of jurisdiction to permit a discontinuance of the trains which were operated by this railroad has one judge dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.047" offset="427551">This railroad operates three trains in each direction between Butler, New Jersey and Susquehanna Transfer in North Bergen, New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.754" offset="498395">Thereafter, passengers are transported by a bus to the Port of New York Authority Bus Terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.685" offset="570075">This carrier sought to discontinue its trains under the provisions of Section 13a (1) of the 1958 Transportation Act which is concerned with interstate trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.432" offset="637053">And the Interstate Commerce Commission and its determination says -- said that these were intrastate trains and the fact that they're connected with a bus carrying them on to New York, did not make it an interstate train, so that the provisions of 13a (1) did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.182" offset="756067">Prior to the enactment of the Transportation Act of 1958, the jurisdiction over the discontinuance of trains and ferries, both interstate and intrastate was -- were in the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.164" offset="840077">The federal or the Interstate Commerce Commission had no jurisdiction over the discontinuance of a train or ferry.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.264" offset="876440">Its jurisdiction was over the discontinuance or the abandonment of a line of railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.922" offset="927013">Now, 13 -- Section 13a is divided into two parts, there's a subsection 13a (1) which deals with a discontinuance of interstate trains and a procedure is outlined in this section where in the carrier post its notices and the Interstate Commerce Commission may or may not act to require those trains to continue.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.280" offset="1056475">And on the other hand, subsection 13a (2) deals with intrastate trains and there, the Interstate Commerce Commission may not act unless and until the state first has had an opportunity to exercise its jurisdiction over those intrastate trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.431" offset="1169115">The procedure under 13a (2) is different too because if a state fails to act within a period of a 120 days or denies the relief that the carrier request with respect to discontinuance, the Intrastate Commerce Commission must hold a full hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.126" offset="1255842">I must make specific findings with respect to the -- or the effect that present and future can -- public convenience and necessity, permit the discontinuance of the service and also that the continued operation of these intrastate trains would be a burden on the carriers' interstate operations or on interstate commerce itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.776" offset="1370467">Now, I believe that the statute itself is quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.019" offset="1391470">It limits its terms to the vehicles of transportation, trains or ferries, buses are not mentioned, terminals are not mentioned and terminal transfers are not mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.412" offset="1465031">And even though the bus here is a vehicle which is incidental to railroad transportation, the word “railroad” and the word “transportation” are larger terms than the words “trains or ferries”.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.299" offset="1544547">The bus is not incidental to a train or to a ferry; it's incidental to railroad transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.672" offset="1602017">Now, I think the court below permitted its attention to be diverted to where the passengers were going, where the tickets -- the destination on the tickets and from that reason a -- an interstate train and I submit that that was incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.419" offset="1709014">It misapplied the word “transportation”.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.013" offset="1723434">Transportation again is a larger term than the word “train”.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.717" offset="1746213">The test in this case, should've been “where do the trains go?”</text>
            <text syncTime="417.112" offset="1771813">Do they travel from a point in one state to a point in the same state or do those trains go from a point in one state to a point in another state?</text>
            <text syncTime="430.713" offset="1826252">Not where the passengers going, not where the bus goes or not where the entertainment -- enter -- terminal transport takes them.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.936" offset="1899081">As far as I know, the Interstate Commerce Commission has authority over the bus, their intrastate bus, by a provision in the carrier's tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.451" offset="1933145">There's a provision that these buses will be carried across to the Port of New York Authority Terminal.</text>

            <text syncTime="479.552" offset="2021543">In other words, omit the provision for the buses and if there was no objection, I presumably, the bus could be discontinued, but I dare say in this situation, there probably would be objections because the New York passengers would have no way of getting over and they would probably ask the Interstate Commerce Commission to conduct an investigation and request a hearing on the subject of amendments to the tariff that would curtail this bus services.</text>

            <text syncTime="1564.587" offset="6361736">In common -- in a common carrier application that the appellee relies upon here, the Interstate Commerce Commission made a finding that this bus and I'm reading from page 50 of the appellee's brief where Section 49 U.S. Code 302 is set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.655" offset="6501961">This bus was transportation by motor vehicle by any person for a common carrier by railroad subject to part 1 etcetera and I'm skipping now to page 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.373" offset="6572910">And then the last four lines there, as part of and shall be regulated in the same manner as transportation by railroad, express, motor vehicle or water or to be freight forwarder, transportation or service to which such services are incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.693" offset="6638111">Now, you see these are incidental to railroad, incidental to express not incidental to a train.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.775" offset="6710523">Now, in the certain point, the appellee makes a great stress on the word “service” and expresses some apprehension that if the trains were discontinued, he would be forced to continue a bus and I submit that this is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.559" offset="6813654">I think that if these trains were allowed to be discontinued, there would be simple filing of an amendment to its tariffs and if the trains were off there, nobody in the world would try to continue a bus service from Susquehanna transferred to New York because there would be no one to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.683" offset="6898082">And the ICC would accept that tariff and entered the filling and that would finish the bus service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.382" offset="6936952">There'd be no need to continue it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.801" offset="6954611">I believe also that the court below considered matters beyond the jurisdictional question and perhaps permitted its sympathy to be carried away but I submit that all of the material on the financial condition of this carrier, the loss of passengers and all are all based upon self-serving statements which were submitted with its application to the ICC for the discontinuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.360" offset="7076864">These have never been tested at a hearing and I think that although the court below has learned in law, I think that the administrative agency with its experts is the correct body to explore these financial losses and find out why or whether or not they are valid and -- or the loss of passengers to determine whether that's valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.239" offset="7208312">I say that if the court below is -- the judgment below is affirmed then for all the country perhaps New Jersey hasn't lost its regulatory jurisdiction over all of the train service in or -- all of the intrastate train service because all of our trains connected one way or another with some other type of vehicle for a trip across the river either on -- at the New York's terminal or in South Jersey at Camden and Philadelphia terminal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1889.831" offset="7662738">Whatever the eventual determination of this case may be, it is a symbolic coincidence that it should've been reached for argument today, December 11, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.594" offset="7721775">The coincidence there that some time today in one of the 85 assembly plants to United States, they will be built a 200 million automobile manufactured in the United States since 1896.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.234" offset="7788335">It took 52 years to build the first 100 million and only 14 years was needed to build the second 100 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.111" offset="7823862">The coincidence is symbolic because this vast achievement of what has become the nation's largest industry is an undeniable reflection of a tremendous change in the travel habits of our public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.005" offset="7891362">And this is itself, the massive force underlying the very difficult problems of the nation's railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.526" offset="7929501">Part of this problem is before the Court today in the form of this disagreement about procedure in which procedure should be followed to discontinue an operation used to transport passengers between New Jersey and New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.335" offset="8000763">Now, before launching into our own affirmative argument, I do want to call attention to several basic factors which will perhaps help answer incidental questions that might otherwise come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.340" offset="8068681">The appellant has noted that the facts relating to the financial results of operation both with respect to the passenger service and the overall passenger and freight operations are merely self-serving declarations not tested at a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.086" offset="8155721">The facts we have pointed out in our statement if the Court please are set out in the statement required to be filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission in a 13a (1) proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.550" offset="8209533">And I refer the Court -- I refer the Court to Section 1.19 of the rules of the Interstate Commerce Commission, 49 Code of Federal Regulations at page 52 of appellee's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.519" offset="8281422">It states that recitals of materials and relevant facts in a pleading filed prior oral hearing in any proceeding unless specifically denied in the counterpleading shall constitute evidence and shall be a part of the record without special admission on corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.204" offset="8364178">But if request was reasonably made, a competent witness must be made available for cross-examination on the evidence so included in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.815" offset="8406601">Now, the appellants here have the opportunity, have they followed a better practice to file an answer on the merits including the issue of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.871" offset="8466892">I'm sure that the concept of waiving jurisdictional issues by filing an answer is no longer true in the proceedings before administrative agencies that is in courts that used to be years ago that if you wanted to challenge the method of service of the summons, you had to make a special appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.179" offset="8556126">And if you so much have asked from an extension of time, you found that you were in court and no longer have the opportunity to challenge service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.780" offset="8590503">In recent years, this has all have been changed, the traps of the technicalities have been erased and the attitude is to encourage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.524" offset="8633448">In fact, required that all matters of defense whether they go to the merits or whether they go to jurisdiction or method of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.712" offset="8670229">So all be raised in the answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.177" offset="8684126">This would give an opportunity if there were a dispute on the facts for the state to have said what that dispute is, having chosen to limit their objection to what they call an issue of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.468" offset="8729266">I submit they can hardly complain here of the effect of the rule of the Commission which makes those statements evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.700" offset="8766151">The other question that I would like to mention very briefly is in relation with the one asked by Mr. Justice Harlan as to what would happen with the state court -- state agency record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.193" offset="8828113">The rules on 13a (2) proceeding which we have also printed at page 56 of appellee's brief, 43.6 subsection (d) to be filed only with the original of the petition to the Commission, copy of the record made before the state authority including copies of the application or petition to a transcript of any of our hearing and decision and order, if any.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.165" offset="8956008">So, the Interstate Commerce Commission itself requires that the record before the agency be in substance to starting point so that all particular data need not be again repeated in the hearing before the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.385" offset="9012955">Now, turning to the substance of the issue on this matter, we submit the judgment of the trial court is undoubtedly correct for the number of independent reasons each of which lead to the conclusion that Section 13a (1) applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.368" offset="9084844">The first reason is that by force of law, case law and statute, this transfer operation between North Bergen, New Jersey and Manhattan, New York is to be regarded and handled in the same way as though the trains themselves went into New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.495" offset="9177318">I say by force its case law because prior the enactment of the Motor Carrier Law in 1935, it had already been ruled by this Court in the Central Transfer case that intra-terminal transfers by motor truck paying within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, it was recognized there and I mentioned this because the rationale is always of more interest than the specific result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.522" offset="9317439">The rationale was that if you're going to regulate the railroad transportation effectively you must regulate all aspects of it and where the transfer is essential to the railroad operation, it would be hopelessly ineffective to allow local agencies to regulate the truck operation and have the Interstate Commerce Commission regulate the trains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.705" offset="9422242">There will be a division of authority here that would undercut the very purpose of the act itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2584.185" offset="10440077">It doesn't -- this case doesn't necessarily mean that for this -- for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.180" offset="10460139">In the first place, I do not understand that the ferries run on schedules that are tied in with the trains in the sense these buses are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.060" offset="10499636">They are general ferries and I can get on that with an automobile, I think even today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.042" offset="10515519">I haven't tried it but I'm pretty sure I can.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.357" offset="10524818">I can certainly walk in off the street and ride without ever being a real passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.650" offset="10545925">Now, if those ferries will run on the basis that these buses were so that Lackawanna will be in a position to say, “We are discontinuing train 111 consisting of the run to Jersey City and the corresponding ferry crossing to New York then this principle might well apply but then it wouldn't be because of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.524" offset="10645504">13a (1) in the state's own argument says train or ferry that's all it would be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.183" offset="10668074">So, even without the question of whether you mean by train, if this were the form of Lackawanna's operation, they could have 13a (1) applied without regard to this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.622" offset="10721886">Now, of course after the Central Transfer case rule at intra-terminal incidental motor truck services were to be regulated in the same fashion as the trains were by the ICC, the same principle was explicitly enacted in 1940 as an amendment to the Motor Carrier Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.738" offset="10810284">That's Section 12 (2) (c) which we referred to which it should be noted not only excludes those operations from part 2 does not treat them as motor carrier operations but affirmatively commands that they be regulated in the same fashion as the transportation by rail to which they are incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.027" offset="10927522">Next, you say the judgment of the trial court is correct by force of res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.612" offset="10953853">In the proceedings of which excerpts appear at the record page 46, the Interstate Commerce Commission has made determinations a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.778" offset="10998471">One, that Susquehanna's terminal is at New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.717" offset="11018219">Two, if the transfer of point in North Bergen is within the terminal area of that terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2736.045" offset="11047581">Three, that the service is an intra-terminal transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.488" offset="11065344">Now, in this respect, our factual and legal background differs considerably from that in the Arlington and Fairfax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.665" offset="11102020">And on to the Fairfax, and this is a history which are little difficult to piece together from the three opinions starting with U.S. against Elgin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.710" offset="11138173">There had been a rail operation into the district with a railroad station in the district across 14th Street Bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.217" offset="11176208">The terminal building was taken by the federal government for government buildings and while the opinions are silent, there must have been some proceeding to abandon that portion of the line of railroad which led from Virginia and to the district because that service stops and the new terminal was in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.687" offset="11258128">Then came the use of this convertible auto car and it's amazing to see how far back that goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.067" offset="11303685">Run on rails and by lowering rubber tired wheels could ride on the city streets and this is where the litigation came up and it's quite a bit of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.361" offset="11344854">The first case was as the result of a refusal of the District Commission to fix a route and the carrier sought mandamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.255" offset="11388426">This was denied and the Court of Appeals affirmed on the ground that the determination of what was a terminal area and whether the Virginia terminals was within that terminal area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.107" offset="11447777">There's a question of fact requiring expert knowledge of transportation and should be made a determination made by the ICC, the Court would not make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.524" offset="11493439">They went back to the Interstate Commerce Commission and they applied for a certificate under 118 to extend their line of railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.452" offset="11545161">And this is what it implies if they must have applied for a certificate to abandon the corresponding portion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.101" offset="11575777">Strangely enough, the Interstate Commerce Commission while holding that this would not be an extension of a line of railroad distinguishing the New York Dock case, expressly said that it did not decide whether it was within the terminal area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.760" offset="11646412">If they had made that determination and if they had been that it wasn't within the terminal area, it would have been no further disputing the question about whether a certificate was needed and what kind of certificate but they passed the question and didn't decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.211" offset="11696253">The carrier went back to the District Commission, did get a route designation but the District Commission refused to say whether or not an ICC certificate was needed so they began operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.368" offset="11752887">A competitor took that into courts on a proceeding for injunction, succeeded in getting the injunction, the appeals was taken, it was argued, the Court was ready to file its opinion when the carrier reported that its financial condition obliged to drop the project entirely and will never find out what the Appellate Court had decided to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.559" offset="11845569">So, I say we learned very little so far as the law is concerned from that one.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.697" offset="13618134">Now, this is interesting because it's the rule of the whole trouble here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.155" offset="13639973">Susquehanna has a line to New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.570" offset="13649690">At the time that this bus service was inaugurated, that service was executed by trains to Jersey City and ferries across the river just like the Erie, just like the New York Central and just like all the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.622" offset="13705906">When this bus service began, we still serve New York by the ferries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.230" offset="13724296">Susquehanna Transfer bus operation was an ultimate group and we went to the Interstate Commerce Commission, someone had raised the question, “Don't you need a certificate to run the bus?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3416.933" offset="13771107">An application was made and the Interstate Commerce Commission said, “No, you don't.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.258" offset="13788453">Your terminal is New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.881" offset="13794931">When you reach North Bergen you are within your terminal area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.890" offset="13810918">The bus operation is intra-terminal transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.297" offset="13824606">It is not “an extension” of a line of railroad not for the reason in Arlington Fairfax but for the reason that our line of railroad already ran to New York and this was simply an ultimate branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.874" offset="13874866">Now, if you read the opinion in the first ferry cases, you will find that the source of the whole difficulty declared to the enactment of 13 (a) was that 118 in the abandonment section had been read to that time and the general understanding was that abandonment necessarily involved a complete termination of service on some serial segment of a railroad and not a parallel segment, if I can make that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.313" offset="14000671">In other words, I might have several ways of going to point A or point B.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.760" offset="14022405">If I am to come under 118, the understanding was that everything between point A and B had to be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.780" offset="14050513">I think this was a misreading of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.937" offset="14063156">It says abandonment in whole or in part and there is nothing I know of that says that a part has to be between point A and B and not one of the routes but anyway that's what they held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.084" offset="14107669">Now, in the first ferry cases --</text>

            <text syncTime="3505.745" offset="14126373">The Commission I believe has a long line of rulings to that effect on what we call curtailment or discontinuance or possible discontinuance of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.350" offset="14176737">Now, in the ferry cases, this came up because the railroads pointed out that they ran a passenger ferry from let us say we walk in to 33rd Street and this was a different route than the route used to carry freight across the Hudson River that the -- the ferry service while starting at one point either we walk at the Jersey City fan out like the fingers of a hand to multiple points of the New York side which were different points for a degree than the freight routes were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.784" offset="14322500">This would have been an abandonment of a part of the line of railroad taking part to meet a parallel alternate route.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.921" offset="14355101">The first ferry cases said, “No.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3564.892" offset="14362937">In line of railroad is a single entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.393" offset="14372968">It is the whole cord and no single strand of that cord may be separated from it and its service terminated unless you abandon operation on the cord as a whole and of that, I think, is the route -- I'm sorry, difficulty as to route of the enactment of 13 (a) I think is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.108" offset="14451754">There's no occasion decided here, I can see, but it is a value in understanding the context in which 13 (a) was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3596.355" offset="14488743">Now, of course as to the idea that a train is a train as the appellant say, this must be said, “A train has any number of varied meanings.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.651" offset="14569932">One meaning could be as suggested by the appellant of this Court had held in the Erie Railroad against United States, a locomotive of cars coupled together from running along the track.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.570" offset="14629700">Of course, that case didn't hold if that's what a train means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.778" offset="14646523">It held that such an operation was a line haul and not a switching operation, entirely different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.315" offset="14672645">But any event, it could mean a specific locomotive and a specific car or set of cars or it can mean the particular run at a certain time of the day between two different points regardless of whether it's the same locomotive or different locomotive, that sort of thing that in railroad pods is called, train 99.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.560" offset="14765641">That train 99 here, if you look at the timetable, is the whole service from Butler to New York and back again, part of which is executed by motor coach, a part of which is executed by anyone of a number of different locomotives, and number of different cars, not the same locomotive and not the same car day in, day out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.033" offset="14875460">Now, of course, it doesn't even mean -- it can't mean the vehicle that runs on steel wheels on tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.487" offset="14921331">The interstate commerce itself -- Interstate Commerce Act itself today, made this 1962 in Section 19 (a), still uses the term “steam railroad.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.093" offset="14967724">We all know very well that the (Inaudible) electric motor power but we wouldn't hesitate to say the railroad that used to use steam is the one that's covered by the Section even though it no longer uses steam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.377" offset="15032926">There was a proposal perhaps six or seven years ago for this very North Jersey and New York area to build a loop service to which the key idea was that the vehicles would run on rubber tires in a concrete channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.848" offset="15122787">They would be automatic like that kind of horizontal elevator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.516" offset="15141386">I'm sure that would be a train for the purpose of 13a (1) but it wouldn't look like the train in the old sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3768.274" offset="15176495">The engineers are suppose to be working on things like levicar that ride on a cushion of air, no wheels at all, would this be a train for the purpose of this section?</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.380" offset="15216933">I'm sure it would.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.967" offset="15223202">So, I don't think it makes much difference that a bus in one sense is not the same thing as a train in that sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="3853.904" offset="15519013">And how this can be an operation which the states must first pass it on, I do not understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3862.078" offset="15551718">In any event, the trial court even if you would read the statute as the appellant suggests, the Court could not have refused to enjoin and set aside the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.474" offset="15601246">First, because the ICC dismissed instead of exercising its undoubted jurisdiction under 13a (2) within appropriate amendment applying the same principles that were stated only a week ago in Forman in this Court that the federal rule of pleading are designed to reach the merits and that's precisely what we feel should have been done here even if the statute is read and as the state contends.</text>
            <text syncTime="3908.282" offset="15736456">And second, because the ICC dismissed on the state's motion not only without a hearing but without an opportunity for a hearing, they dismissed it before the time for reapply under their own rules that had expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.221" offset="15792253">And this, at least was a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.492" offset="15809390">Now, the state insists that 13a (2) applies and that it should have the first opportunity to conduct the hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3934.829" offset="15842722">The difficulty with this argument is that it has admitted to this Court in the course of the papers filed that this case was right for 13a (2) proceeding at the time this statement was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3950.025" offset="15903431">Secondly, it is not required by state law and this is RS-48224 which we cite on page 16 of our brief that the State Commission be on the application of the carrier, the state agency has a general supervisory power just as the federal commission has and it is kept thoroughly aware of conditions through required filing, it may itself initiate and hold a hearing on this question any time it chose to do so.</text>
