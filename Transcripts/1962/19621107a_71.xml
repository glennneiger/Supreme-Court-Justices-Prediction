            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">James Richard Peterson et al., Petitioner, versus City of Greenville.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.017" offset="131427">Mr. Snyder you may continue your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="theodore_a_snyder_jr" startTime="10.199" stopTime="294.086">
            <label>Mr. Theodore A. Snyder, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="10.199" offset="144175">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.501" offset="153370">One of the chief issues in this case as well as the other cases which is in the brief before you gentlemen is the question of freedom of speech whether or not these petitioners were exercising any right of freedom of speech when they staged this “sit-in” demonstration.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.986" offset="223274">We submit that they were not.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.043" offset="231528">First, of all in considering the question of freedom of speech, you have to consider where the traditional area for speech in public speaking has taken place in this country and we found on looking at cases that the traditional area of speech where you have people who -- to begin with or not (Inaudible) to speak in detail, as between the associates or friends in a private discussion, is that they have to meet in the public places for that discussion, that is on the streets, in the park, in the places where ordinary people would come together who had something that they wished to talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.151" offset="383979">Then we think it's proper that people should have the freedom to speak to each other and try to convince others of their views when they meet on public places, in a place like that, and we think they have a right go there to try to convince others of their thoughts, of their ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.509" offset="461406">You go a step further, however, when you have a person who wishes to try to convince someone else of his ideas and thoughts when he goes onto that man's private property to do so, and that's what you have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.007" offset="515427">The petitioners who claimed they were exercising the right of speech had left the traditional area of speech which is out in the public and out in the open and they have gone inside the store where they now seek to speak not to the other public in general, not to someone who may be by chance coming down the street, but where they had seek to speak to the owner or the manager or the operator of these particular premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.598" offset="621798">So they have narrowed down in two ways from first, they have moved away from the traditional area of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.103" offset="651786">And second, they have moved in and they have narrowed their desire to speak to a particular person and not to speak to anyone in general or to anyone who may be happened to be present.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.109" offset="707793">Now, they might have that right and we don't deny that they have a right to go to the store, to attempt to speak to the manager, or to anyone that may be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.701" offset="746141">They have at least the right to make an attempt to go there and begin a conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.424" offset="769024">But we submit that they do not have a right to stay there and force the person they found there whether he might be the manager or someone else to stay and listen to their ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.112" offset="815835">They have no right to force him to listen to them on his own property when he does not desire to listen to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.276" offset="860453">If he does, he takes away from that person his right of speaking himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.623" offset="885844">He has no chance to do anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.064" offset="899636">The law even in the public places has, as it's concerning freedom of speech here before, has given the right of the person that he has spoken to either to refuse to listen or to require the person who would speak to move away.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.480" offset="957315">For example, in Cantwell against Connecticut, you had a speech problem with the persons that -- where they would be listeners after they had heard all that they desired to hear, require the speaker to move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.673" offset="1010082">They moved on themselves to -- because they didn't want to hear anymore and they have that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.337" offset="1032756">You have the same question in the Doorbell cases where on the grounds of freedom of religion, a person has the right to ring a doorbell to someone, the householder, but the householder is not required to stand there and listen to whatever the speaker may have to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.656" offset="1097958">He has a right if he does not agree with the person to require him to move on.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.473" offset="1121259">He is not required by any measure for freedom of speech to engage in a conversation with that person if he does not desire to and that's what you have in this case, where the manager after he had heard the side of the argument presented to him by the petitioners, didn't desire to negotiate with them, didn't desire to discuss the question with them any further, and he asked them to proceed about their own business somewhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.409" offset="1232959">That was his right.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.433" offset="1237138">He didn't have to sit there and listen to their demands hour after hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.011" offset="1255424">When he had told them that, their duty was then to proceed and take their conversation somewhere else.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.086" offset="1279666">Mr. Snyder, would you mind at this point if it doesn't disturb the course of your argument, saying a word about whether -- in connection with whether the manager was operating under his own esteem as were in this area about the propriety of the trial judge's action in refusing to permit Mr. Perry to inquire into the question of whether or not there had been prearrangement with the police to take action in connection with the “sit-in”?</text>

            <label>Mr. Theodore A. Snyder, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="327.773" offset="1414457">I think in that connection Your Honor that the petitioners would have had a right to prove if they could have.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.781" offset="1446536">The fact that there was a prearrangement with the police in which the police had directed the store manager or the storeowners to take the course of action that he did.</text>

            <text syncTime="350.447" offset="1505155">They're not, sir, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.649" offset="1513932">First of all, after the first objection was made and sustained, the witness Mr. West's manager was asked for what reason did he then exclude the petitioners and his answer was not because of some prearrangement but because of the custom and the ordinance which had been discussed which was the ordinance to prove -- which we submit prohibiting trespass after notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.151" offset="1623960">Now, wouldn't the -- would it not have been appropriate in connection with that answer to pursue the question of whether the police had in effect asserted the ordinance with him, because as I read the record and I am starting on page 22 where that offer was made, Mr. Perry was foreclosed by the judge unless he would persist after a judge's ruling which he could not very well --</text>

            <text syncTime="408.704" offset="1738167">We would not require him to persist after his objection has been overruled, but on our procedure, Your Honor that man, who has been foreclosed in this manner, may if he desires and if he wishes to protect and sustain his objection there, should've made an offer of proof into the record which he had a right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.416" offset="1821027">In other words, he could have stated for the record at that point about the waiver of proof what the testimony of the manager was anticipated to be on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.996" offset="1867316">And he could have done that if he so desired, but he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.061" offset="1883617">The fact that he did not shows to us the fact that the manager could not be expected to have testified as to any such an arrangement.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.098" offset="1979747">I understand what he was stating that his objection was that he desired to attempt to show by cross-examination but he did not state that he expected the manager to testify to that effect, which he would have had gone if he wanted to make a proof -- an offer of proof in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.091" offset="2095731">In conclusion, just let me say that we have here under the Fourteen Amendment the question of whether or not you're going to -- you're going to have to balance two things really.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.601" offset="2149752">You have a property right on the one hand, in the hands of the property owner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.135" offset="2171904">On the other hand, you have the asserted right of these petitioners to a portion of their liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.158" offset="2200012">This Court, is absolutely -- this has got to draw the line between those two rights which are both equally protected and as I read the amendment in the decisions of coequal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.804" offset="2246614">The Court has got to decide whether or not one right would give way to the other in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.893" offset="2274931">We submit that in this -- in the case that is presented here and under its facts that the Court should decide that the property right of the owner of this property is paramount to the right of the petitioners to have their liberty there, on these premises, for the purposes for which they were present.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.763" offset="2358418">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="817.581" offset="3373746">And the manager was left without a choice and acted in asking these petitioners to leave his premises according to his testimony pursuant to the mandate of the ordinance.</text>

            <text syncTime="883.268" offset="3636433">The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals required the Greenville Airport Commission to desegregate that airport and the same counsel in this case before this Court today were counsel in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="950.649" offset="3906017">The store manager acting not upon his personal choice but upon the mandate or pursuant to the mandate of the City of Greenville and of the State of South Carolina and following its broad plan of keeping the races separated in every area of life in South Carolina chose to tell this man to segregate white and Negroes seeking to eat in the premises of his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.428" offset="4049063">In Shelley against Kraemer, this Court said, the Constitution confers upon no individual the right to demand action by the State which results in the denial of equal protection of the laws to other individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.770" offset="4118444">We respectfully say to this Court that this is what has happened in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.494" offset="4145298">That whatever right of personal choice the manager of Kress' had in this case, he did not use it.</text>
