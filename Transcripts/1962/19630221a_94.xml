            <text syncTime="10.366" offset="144802">Mr. Heiss, you may proceed now.</text>

            <text syncTime="13.630" offset="157863">Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.248" offset="184404">The petitioners in this cause are the Four Railroad Transportation Brotherhoods, holding collective bargaining contracts on the Louisville Nashville Railroad which was plaintiff in the trial court and is the respondent in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.008" offset="263398">The case involves the construction and application on the Railway Labor Act, a statute which this Court in recent years has had occasion to examine on several occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.206" offset="328182">This particular case involves a labor dispute on the respondent railroad which was submitted to the National Railroad Adjustment Board by the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.125" offset="383875">The submission resulted in an award favorable to the employees which the railroad has declined to make effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.635" offset="429955">Since the railroad declined to make the award effective, the employees regarded the dispute as unsettled and insisted upon the right to bargain respecting the dispute by all lawful methods including the calling of a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.813" offset="510621">This was a minor dispute properly before the Adjustment Board and the Adjustment Board processes have been exhausted and completed Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.098" offset="547715">No question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.138" offset="559940">No question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.551" offset="565582">No dispute on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.402" offset="573001">The question before this Court is whether such a strike is lawful or whether it is forbidden by the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.110" offset="619813">A strike to settle the grievance was enjoined by the District Court, and the injunction affirmed by the Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.394" offset="660982">We sought certiorari, if Your Honors please, because we believe that if the decisions below stand collective bargaining as a means of settling minor disputes in the railroad industry will be destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.282" offset="724511">By collective bargaining, I mean negotiation, conference, and mediation culminating in extreme cases in strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.984" offset="763277">The alternative to collective bargaining as I've defined it is the procedure which the decisions below thrust upon the railroad industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.713" offset="806222">The reference of untold thousands of grievances to the Adjustment Board for decisions and their ultimate review by the courts when the awards are in favor of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.461" offset="857213">I want to make it clear, the threshold of this case that there is more involved here than the means of disposing of a single grievance of involving a few thousand dollars in pay, there is involved in my opinion, the monumental question of whether collective bargaining is going to survive as a means of settling grievances in this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.062" offset="963584">And with that context, I should like to tell the Court the facts which are simple, undisputed and not particularly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.868" offset="1010813">Humphries, a fireman, a locomotive fireman was discharged in 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.320" offset="1040697">The fireman's crafts sought -- the Representative of the fireman's crafts sought his reinstatement, and threatened this -- ultimately threatened a strike to secure the reinstatement whereupon the railroad submitted the dispute as to his reinstatement to the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.789" offset="1114572">The submission involved, one; the question of the justification for discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.248" offset="1140381">And two; whether Humphries should be paid for the time lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.187" offset="1160129">The submission did not involve the major to be applied in the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.493" offset="1189386">The finding should be that he was entitled to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.815" offset="1206627">The Adjustment Board in its award in favor of Humphries found that he should be reinstated and paid for time loss as the rule is construed on the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.098" offset="1263783">Thereupon, the representatives of the fireman's craft carried the award to the carriers and asked that it be made effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.811" offset="1302653">All four organizations, all four petitioning organizations were invited by the representative of the fireman's craft to participate in these negotiations to make the award effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.937" offset="1347166">The railroad made no complaint about the presence of the four representatives, but told before that in future cases, in cases of reinstatement after discharge that all of them will be treated alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.245" offset="1408397">To wit, that in the measurement of what the pay for time loss should be, that outside earnings made by the individual employer would be set off against the amount of earnings that he would have accumulated had he remained in the employment of the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.022" offset="1503483">It was the contention of the representatives of all four organizations which had identical contracts that under the particular rule involved here that pay for time loss did not include this matter of off setting outside pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.301" offset="1572551">Admittedly, it was a penalty rule and quite different from the common law rule which would have -- which would have applied in the absence of a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.232" offset="1612257">Now under the threat of a strike, because of the railroad's unwillingness to settle this remaining labor dispute, a second submission was made in the docket of the first case by the railroad to the Board asking that the Board interpret this -- its award as to the measure of pay whether outside earnings should reduce the amount which Humphries would have to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.137" offset="1719881">The Board held that the measure of pay was not presented by or argued in the first submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.525" offset="1753422">And that the Board would not determine the question of the measure of pay under the guise of an interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.285" offset="1796472">And hence that ended the second submission which the representatives of the employees carried back to the railroad company.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.202" offset="1832208">And as for the pay as they in -- the amount of pay which they set had been always paid in accordance with the scheduled rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.883" offset="1866898">Under a second strike threat, a third submission was made by the railroad company to the National Railroad Adjustment Board this under a new docket number.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.022" offset="1923427">And the railroad company in the third submission asked whether it should be required to pay the accumulated pay or the accumulated pay mitigated by the amount of outside earning.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.046" offset="1987584">The Adjustment Board on this third submission dismissed the case, holding that the Board rules prevented a piecemeal submission of disputes and that the railroad company, either that one of the Board's determination of that particular issue should have presented it in the first submissions of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.842" offset="2086745">And that it's failure to do so, had barred the L &amp; N. Railroad from bringing the case subsequently to the attention of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.403" offset="2133034">That was the Board's interpretation of its rules and that ends the third submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.620" offset="2157902">Now, as I told the Court at the beginning, the Adjustment Board process in this case is at an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.001" offset="2187368">There is no opportunity for anyone, petitioners or the respondents to have further recourse to the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.271" offset="2220492">There is a labor dispute between the labor organizations and the L &amp; N. Railroad as to Humphries' future treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.705" offset="2262183">That dispute is unsettled and we claim and assert and contain that collective bargaining is the solution to the problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1159.225" offset="4740263">Namely, that the presence of the enforcement procedure is an intrical part of the statutory scheme for the complete and final settlement of grievances and that the presence of this remedy excludes any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.523" offset="4801494">This is the contention we must meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.263" offset="4812466">Now, there are five elements at least which support we believe our contention that the enforcement remedy is not exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.779" offset="4854471">First, it's not stated to be exclusive in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.313" offset="4872652">Stated in another way, the Railway Labor Act does not specifically forbid strikes for the purpose of enforcing settlement of awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.298" offset="4916537">There's no specific prohibition against strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.577" offset="4933674">Second, the legislative history fails completely to reveal that the remedy of an enforcement suit is exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.680" offset="4978082">It reveals, we believe to the contrary that the enforcement suit was made available as an additional remedy to the remedy of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.976" offset="5023326">Third, when the 1934 Amendments were adopted, Congress had before it the question of whether to insert provisions in the amendment authorizing injunction against strikes when Board awards are involved in grievance cases and inserted no such provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.120" offset="5111829">We believe that the Court should not find a broad prohibition in the statute when Congress consciously refrained from inserting such a prohibition, or the doctrine of exclusiveness is inconsistent with the provisions of Section 3 Second of the Railway Labor Act which permits group, regional or system boards to be established by voluntary agreement without enforcement provisions being applicable to such boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.404" offset="5265011">Now, if the achievement of industrial peace is to be accomplished in respective grievance cases by the presence of the enforcement procedure, it is our position that the enforcement procedure would have been made applicable to the establishment of the voluntary regional or system boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.364" offset="5364799">But Section 3 (p) as Your Honors will observe is limited to enforcing the award of the division of the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.697" offset="5402206">And neither in Section 3 Second, nor in Section 3 (p), nor in any other place of the Act is there the slightest indication that the enforcement procedure can be utilized with respect to an award rendered by one of these voluntarily established boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.722" offset="5490291">And incidentally, there is no limitation upon the number of these voluntary established boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.745" offset="5514324">They could have been established on every railroad and in every region of the country and it virtually have done away with the jurisdiction of the National Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1501.476" offset="6109288">Chicago River held that while disputes were pending before the Adjustment Board, strikes could not be tolerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.351" offset="6148786">In the Kansas City Terminal case decided two weeks later, this Court in a per curiam opinion granted certiorari and summarily reversed the Kansas City Court of Appeals which had enjoined a strike conducted by the -- about to be conducted by the fireman's organization to settle some grievances, but under circumstances where neither party had taken the case to the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.124" offset="6283891">Now, the Court said this: The judgment of the Kansas City Court of Appeals must be vacated in the light of our decision in Chicago River because the dispute here is not ending before the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.956" offset="6351182">The cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this position and without prejudice to the power of the Court of Appeals to reinstate its judgment if the dispute is submitted to the Adjustment Board by either party within a reasonable time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.347" offset="6424743">Now, as I see it, there is a reconciliation to the end between the Kansas City Terminal case and the Chicago River case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.425" offset="6493080">When a dispute has not been taken by either party to the Adjustment Board as I construe the Kansas City Terminal opinion, an injunction for strike could not lie, otherwise I don't believe that the Court would have vacated it in a particular instance of the Kansas City Terminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.043" offset="6583568">And the only way as I read the Kansas City Terminal decision for reinstating the injunction would be the taking of the dispute by one party or the other to the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="1676.091" offset="6807698">But I believe the effect that the affirmation of the decision of the courts below I think would be chaotic in this industry, and I want to tell you why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.980" offset="6855241">The solution of the problem of disposing of grievances, the founders of this industry and the founders of this Act in Congress believed, in my opinion, lies in the collective bargaining process and not in the National Railroad Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.913" offset="6939042">Without the collective bargaining process and the threat of strike being posed, the National Mediation Board will become a nullity so far as an effective influence in the disposition of grievances is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.284" offset="7004557">Now, we're here dealing with like -- this is a typical instance of multitude of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.237" offset="7048338">There's nothing difference in Humphries' case from thousands that developed on the railroads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.011" offset="7071431">The primary method of disposing of those grievances has been bargaining, conferences with a strike poised in the back of and without the economic power of a strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.037" offset="7115525">Somewhere along this line, we won't get these grievances disposed off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.802" offset="7142588">Now, our position in this case is that we are at that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1767.766" offset="7174457">The Adjustment Board processes are behind us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.616" offset="7185847">We're trying to enforce award that is favorable to us, with an excellent equitable position and we urge upon you that we are at that point where the economic power which was not attempted to be obliterated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.794" offset="7254497">In the passage of 1934 Amendments must be preserved for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.703" offset="7286157">Since the Chicago River case, let me in a few moments study what has happened to the proceedings before the Adjustment Board, so far as an effective instrument of industrial peace is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.325" offset="7332655">In 1958, 457 awards rendered by the Adjustment Board, that was one year after the Chicago River case where the threat of strike was removed while cases were pending before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1825.298" offset="7404544">In 1962, 163 cases were decided, considerably less than half.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.921" offset="7447071">The railroads were not cooperating with this in the disposition of grievances before that Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.539" offset="7481553">1962 was the poorest year productively in the National Media -- National Railroad Adjustment Board annuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.013" offset="7519378">These figures are obtainable in the reports of the Board in the Mediation Board offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.100" offset="7543724">In 1957, the backlog was approximately 2400 cases pending before that Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.276" offset="7576430">In 1962, the backlog had increased by 50% to 3500 in 92 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.532" offset="7609448">The railroads were preparing under the (Inaudible) of the Chicago River case and the program which they initiated in the courts below in this case and the D&amp;RGW case, to refuse to settle grievances with us, to refuse to dispose of them before the Adjustment Board and enforce this into two, and three, and four year litigation on the courts, to enforce even favorable awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.819" offset="7722611">Now at the rate of 200 cases a year which is more than they disposed of last year would take from 15 to 20 years for that Adjustment Board, to dispose of the backlog of 3600 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.641" offset="7785932">And so far as my figures are concerned, the number of cases coming to the Board is progressively increasing year by year or at least its remaining steady.</text>

            <text syncTime="2655.717" offset="10726275">And Commissioner Eastman says, this is at page 46 of our appendix, “Now the only question I am in doubt about is whether or not there should be an injunction under this Act to prevent a strike.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.845" offset="10850722">Then Mr. Karmel says at the bottom of page 47, “It seems to be at least arguable that a strike by the enjoined of the provisions of this law that to say, a strike is called because of failure to comply with an adverse decision of the judgment of the Board in favor of the carriers against the employees.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.476" offset="10917282">This question of strike injunctions was considered and Congress washed its hands of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.769" offset="10938493">And our preposition to this Court is that we think if Congress refrained from writing in a strike injunction provision that the Court should refrain from writing one in Congress place.</text>

            <text syncTime="2856.962" offset="11531264">Now, in Kentucky under what we called the Wells case which is in 147A and the findings of facts in conclusions of law of the Court, it has been consistently that this rule has been interpreted by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky as back as for 1942.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.046" offset="11631574">The whole -- that the rule means that the man is to be made whole that it is not a penalty rule and that outside earnings, earning during the time he has been off can be deducted and should be deducted and it is on -- and the burden is on him on to so prove.</text>

            <text syncTime="2947.525" offset="11893426">And also I might point Your Honor to rule -- for example, on page 220B of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.460" offset="11917249">You will find an interpretation award in which this very question has came up between the parties and the deduction of outside earnings was allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.369" offset="11968867">And that was based there upon the federal rule and the general common law which permits this deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2973.566" offset="11997602">Now, if Your Honor -- the reason I am mentioning this is to show the area of the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.085" offset="12023724">There is a legitimate dispute here and the trial court so found in these findings of fact that the railroad had in good faith could insist that these deductions be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.396" offset="12076910">Now, when it reached this point, the next thing that was done was what the Act suggests under (o), and the railroad over the objection of the unions resubmitted this award and questioned to the Adjustment Board for an interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.961" offset="12155173">You'll find in the record that interpretation and it came down by a referee, the Board's deadlocked in each one of these instances and actually their decisions by a referee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.776" offset="12202506">And in those particular cases -- in that particular case they said that this was a new cause and therefore could not be interpreted as an interpretation under (o).</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.444" offset="12249109">Therefore, the railroad went back to the union and said, “Let's submit this to the Board as a new question.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.535" offset="12277530">And the union did not agree and the railroad then did submit the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.016" offset="12303444">The union called a strike after it was in the Adjustment Board and as a result, we are here after evidence and proof concerning the purpose of the strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="4113.229" offset="16556283">The only closest thing to it Your Honor is Dorsey against Kansas where efforts were made in a Kansas Act that controlled matters pretty well to bring a suit or to strike on behalf of a second employee who had a claim against the company and it was held in that case that there was not a common law strike or right to strike in all instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.033" offset="16659519">And that it was limited to determining the purpose of the strike and if the strike was for any of the purpose, it could be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.549" offset="16689612">Again Your Honor, going back to the particular Act in question as far as we are concerned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4153.557" offset="16717615">If a time claim is filed which is contented to be a breach of contract, certainly the procedure before the Adjustment Board is available and we have many such claims at our file.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.831" offset="16758680">And they come out as money awards and are enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.120" offset="16771845">Very few of these cases ever get to the enforcement proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.874" offset="16790862">Frankly Your Honor, because most of them were paid when they are against the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.331" offset="16816671">Because the company or the railroad cannot justify the incurring of additional expense, if it feels it does not have a case it can win.</text>

            <text syncTime="4191.593" offset="16869752">Yes sir, but that doesn't mean that the case is after they are disposed off are not accordingly paid or settled out according to the recommendations of the Adjustment Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4203.681" offset="16918131">The last aspect of the case that I would like to say that there are many voluntary rights that we had, that have been limited by the Railway Labor Act, the right -- of course Illinois against Howard and all those discriminatory cases come into play here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.607" offset="16993782">Many rights to bring you different kinds of actions like declaratory judgment actions have been eliminated by the Railway Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.403" offset="17028995">And so there is nothing different or unusual in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4236.829" offset="17050728">Now, concerning the right to an injunction, we believe we're entitled to an injunction under the theory of the Chicago River case because there's no difficulty with Norris-La Guardia here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4249.967" offset="17103287">This is -- injunction is for the purposes of vindicating the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.384" offset="17120946">We believe it's just this simple that the only way the Adjustment Board award can be enforced is by an enforcement suit which is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4262.813" offset="17154591">Therefore, an injunctive process is justified to vindicate the provisions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4269.137" offset="17179878">We believe that on all sides of this question, statutory interpretation, judicial precedent, legislative history, that we are entitled to have this sustained.</text>
