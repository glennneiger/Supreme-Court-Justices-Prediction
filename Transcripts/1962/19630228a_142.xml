            <text syncTime="12.855" offset="156881">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.024" offset="165554">At the close yesterday, I was dealing with the problem what are the Schempp's complaining about?</text>
            <text syncTime="22.158" offset="194079">First, they're not complaining that we're using the Bible in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.232" offset="214350">They have said in their brief that they're not complaining that the fact that the Bible is being used, they say what they complain about is the way it's being used.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.957" offset="253221">This is consistent with the two decrees of the Court, never has the Court said that we cannot use the Bible in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.020" offset="285508">Consequently, the problem here is how do we use the Bible in the school?</text>
            <text syncTime="51.465" offset="311317">We say and the statute says to bring lessons of morality to the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.592" offset="335768">The Schempps say, “No, you can't be doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.582" offset="351754">How can you teach anything?</text>
            <text syncTime="63.476" offset="359278">How can you bring lessons of morality to the children?</text>
            <text syncTime="67.147" offset="374011">How is it a proper way to teach if you only use one source,” we only use one book, “if you don't allow any comment to be made on what, what is being read?</text>
            <text syncTime="78.472" offset="419359">If you don't select particular passages that are unusually good,” they say, “this can't be teaching morality.”</text>
            <text syncTime="87.434" offset="455199">They say, “You're not teaching morality.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.711" offset="464290">What in fact you're doing,” they say, “is you are teaching some kind of a public school creed, it doesn't have religion that's cut adrift from theology.”</text>
            <text syncTime="104.172" offset="522073">On page 29 of their brief, in the second paragraph they say, and they're talking about the Bible reading practice, they say, “The result is to foster a kind of colorless national or public school creed, a religiosity without religion, a sanctimonious eclecticism cut adrift from theology.”</text>
            <text syncTime="128.797" offset="620607">And gentlemen, that is precisely what we're doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.357" offset="630847">We are teaching morality without religion cut adrift from theology, and that is proper for the people of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.341" offset="674732">We can bring to our children the lessons of morality in their school days as long as we're not bringing religion, not bringing theology.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.425" offset="711095">The people of Pennsylvania have wanted to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.715" offset="720290">They have -- since the beginning, wanted to bring these lessons of morality to the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.745" offset="740352">So what did they do?</text>
            <text syncTime="159.552" offset="743591">They picked a common source of morality, the Bible.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.873" offset="760936">They could have picked two sources, ten sources, a hundred sources, but they didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.260" offset="778491">In their wisdom, they picked the Bible.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.685" offset="792179">In order that only the morals would be taught.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.476" offset="803359">In order to keep out any possibility of theology, of doctrines sneaking in, they say it shall be read without comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.163" offset="838050">They say we shall not pick certain particular passages.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.256" offset="858425">They didn't want any possibility of any sectarian or religious instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.206" offset="882249">Now, perhaps the result is as the Schempp say, it's colorless.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.431" offset="903147">I don't know what a colorless creed is or what a colorful creed is.</text>

            <text syncTime="2411.949" offset="9753224">I believe that Mr. Ward has completely stated the procedural history of the case and I'll not repeat that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.126" offset="9789900">And for the most part, I believe it's fairly and most fairly covered the facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.969" offset="9817276">Well, I would like to comment in one or two particular along the evidence, and one or the two of the facts of the case which I think needs some comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.549" offset="9855624">First of all, I think it should be quite clearly understood that the particular practice described by one of the witnesses who are the school district who run the radio and the television workshop was characterized by the lower court as an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.116" offset="9933887">And the record is quite clear that in the other schools of Abington Township where these children went, as a matter of fact, when the first trial was held, the practice is typical of the Commonwealth in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.873" offset="9996894">And if it makes any difference and that is that the teachers generally read the ten verses of -- or in the alternative assign it to some child in rotation, you don't have the public address system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.409" offset="10051020">And in fact on cross examination, the teacher who described that practice conceded that it was only his own individual innovation which had prompted him to suggest that since the children might well read better from the radio techniques then point as he put it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.535" offset="10119565">If they had a chance to practice, they might use at home their own Bibles and then come in and use them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.305" offset="10142657">But it -- if that makes any difference, I think the lower court was quite right in saying that that would only mean that you'd established a number of religions or religion generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.946" offset="10177243">And in fact, we never did find out from that witness what the Jewish children did about the Lord's Prayer because they leave that too, you see over the PA system since the Lord's Prayer isn't in their Bible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.296" offset="10226563">Now, the other point that I would make is this question of where does the Lord's Prayer stand in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.566" offset="10251640">It's quite true it is not mandated by the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2561.210" offset="10350279">And the witnesses' attention was direct to the portion which refers to “Teachers-Professional Obligations”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2568.829" offset="10380685">And it states there that the first professional obligation is to comply with the state regulation in reading at least ten verses of scripture each morning without comment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2679.210" offset="10822259">I don't think that that -- the case turns on whether the teacher could refuse.</text>

            <text syncTime="2721.197" offset="10990174">I really think that the brief was quoted out of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.029" offset="11005534">The Schempps testified, children and father alike, of specific creedal, doctrinal religious beliefs of theirs as taught in their family and in their church that were opposed by, if you will, contrary to specific things that had been read from the King James version of the Bible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.358" offset="11090902">Since they are Unitarians, the most obvious one is the concept of the trinity and the concept of unity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.925" offset="11117129">This is -- this is the -- the most obvious, but there were others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.461" offset="11135310">Mr. Schempp said that he didn't wish his children to get the concept of -- as he put it a God of vengeance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.869" offset="11168852">The Old Testament God, the jealous God who demands blood sacrifices, and says, “If you don't correct, do them properly.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2785.701" offset="11248264">Of course there are morality teachings in the Bible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.497" offset="11259444">And of course those things which I frankly say, I think would offend present day morality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.234" offset="11278357">I have no hesitations in saying that, because to an adult or with teaching, they can be explained as a great evolving concept to these people, first towards monotheism then to rid themselves of these practices left over from Pagan times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.183" offset="11338125">And finally, it will evolve into a concept of God, certainly the God at the end even of the New Testament is not the God of the beginning of the New Testament, but the children can't separate this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2817.839" offset="11376786">I'm not sure it's morality particularly to tell the children that I'm just -- and I'm only picking things that were in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.169" offset="11398102">I mean, you could go at random through the Bible, but Mr. Schempp says, “When the Bible says if it -- animal dies within your gaze speed and not to those within your greats but to the strangers outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.225" offset="11442301">Now, this doesn't seem like morality to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.926" offset="11449093">Now, this can be explained.It just so happened that that particular thing was cited and then Dr.Grayzel, a Jewish expert said, well this can be explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.870" offset="11480858">I won't go to the explanation, but there is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.278" offset="11490576">Now, this is a different thing with the explanation, but the young children -- one wonders whether this is necessarily --“</text>

            <text syncTime="2896.520" offset="11691510">It teaches -- the book teaches from the opening chapter of Genesis to the last chapter of Revelations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.023" offset="11713557">It teaches -- it teaches the way the world was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.825" offset="11728708">And I think it teaches in the sectarian sense from the opening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.584" offset="11743754">From the very open, it says “And lo the Spirit was upon the orders”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.481" offset="11759323">And in the King James version and I'm sure the Douay Version, that word is capitalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.071" offset="11773743">It means the Holy Ghost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.485" offset="11779385">This is the beginning of a teaching of a concept of Trinity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2926.129" offset="11809896">When Jesus said, “Others have said unto you, an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2956.641" offset="11931941">It's really as the Attorney General of Maryland said a question of theism or nontheism is to find a face of hundreds of years of history in bloodshed, I submit, for the religious history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.252" offset="11974468">And I said there that that is -- to do that is to deny the validity to many and the value of specific creedal, religious belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.332" offset="12018772">Not religion in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.235" offset="12026399">Not a kind of generalized theism which is suitable to some, but not to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.757" offset="12048447">And I said that to do that is to lead to a foster of kind of colorless national public school creed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.168" offset="12082092">But, I don't say that's what they're doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3001.298" offset="12110618">We're just reading some lessons of morality, I submit to tend to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.375" offset="12126919">And I submit that it isn't the function of Government, school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.346" offset="12150847">It isn't the function of -- even forces in society to ensure that these religious differences of America shall somehow be sort of blurred and sickle over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.855" offset="12188881">And we'll come out with this kind of morality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.239" offset="12198390">I don't think that's the business of the public schools particularly, but it's a tenancy behind this kind of practice when it's justified in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.430" offset="12227124">And of course, it must be because to say otherwise is to admit it for what it is and for what the legislation so clearly intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.691" offset="12268189">They didn't single out another single work in the range of the world's literature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.383" offset="12286997">And there are other sources of morality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.535" offset="12295565">Not one other book in all the range of the world's religious and secular of the literature is singled out by the legislature of Pennsylvania to be read.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.410" offset="12331092">How many?</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.195" offset="12334226">Ten verses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.303" offset="12338615">It shall be read, how?</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.220" offset="12346347">Without comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.827" offset="12352721">This -- this is -- this is unique to start with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.652" offset="12364006">Now to be sure, the legislature said, “Well we do this for secular purpose.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.610" offset="12391905">And I think that all establishments are nominally done for a secular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.917" offset="12409041">At least since the middle ages, I suggest there's never been an establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.112" offset="12421893">And I mean real complete establishment such as you have in England, you have in Scandinavian countries where their churches such as you have in, shall we say, Italy or Spain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.195" offset="12458151">There has never been an establishment in modern times which purported to be an establishment in order to convert men to the doctrine, but rather to improve their ways, because isn't it true that the majority, and they're the ones who are in the position to have an establishment always say, and they must assume, well it's not only our religion that is so effective, but you know, our particular religion just has a way of making men better than other religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.251" offset="12562432">And therefore, it's to the good of the State to have it established.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.881" offset="12576956">Then I suggest, in answer to Your Honor, Justice Stewart's question, that leads me very close.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.535" offset="12607572">I'd like to try to answer them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.719" offset="12612274">You haven't put it to me, but you put it to one counsel yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.923" offset="12625126">And you said these are not inherited in this situation, a conflict between a Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.221" offset="12662324">And I think not for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.506" offset="12675490">I do not think that the Free Exercise Clause -- well, first of all let me say, of course, it can not prevent people from praying.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.860" offset="12704852">I mean people could pray and they pray and nobody stops them from praying as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.641" offset="12727944">The question is, is it a constitutional right under the Free Exercise Clause to have the State conduct the prayer or to pray in other words under the ejus of the State?</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.363" offset="12770889">And I think clearly not, even if the overwhelming majority has so feel, I think it probably had nothing to do with the question of majority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3718.359" offset="14978863">He said this has been where the multitude Christ not for Barabbas, but for Jesus and Pilate washes his hands and the version exculpates the Romans for the death of Christ.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.220" offset="15026301">And then the Jews say and they've so described they say, “His blood be upon us and our children.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3767.234" offset="15174363">Sometimes deliberately, I am sorry to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.772" offset="15184499">And Dr. Grayzel pointed out that that money was cross-examined inadvertently about the story of the Good Samaritan which would appear to everyone, perhaps to be a very nice story.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.548" offset="15215637">And he pointed out that deliberate anti-Semitic bias of that story and how historically the story had some origin and Jewish roots, but that the Samaritan have been substituted for the Israelite, it originally being a story of the three great nations of Jewish society and their varying responsibilities in terms of the laws regarding cleanliness and disease.</text>

            <text syncTime="4409.555" offset="17743663">And there's necessarily some mechanism behind this as first to purchase, distribution of the King James Version of the Bible throughout the school system.</text>

            <text syncTime="4816.659" offset="19372032">I understand Barnette to be a situation in which the Jehovah's Witnesses are not complaining about professions of belief and disbelief but about the idea that to raise your hand towards the flag was violation of the (Voice Overlap).</text>
            <text syncTime="4831.558" offset="19431696">But, I submit that the flag salute and particularly then before it had the ‘54 Clause in an under God.</text>
            <text syncTime="4838.866" offset="19460848">The act of saluting the flag is a secular act to everyone except to Jehovah's Witness or maybe some other few sects.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.045" offset="19489583">But it's a secular act, and that's the reason that Court there stops short of prohibiting the activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4854.113" offset="19521870">They simply because it's enough there if you simply say you, if your religion thinks of it as a religious act, you don't have to participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4863.065" offset="19557710">But it being to everyone else a secular activity, then you have no standing or did they ask by the way and that's another point, they didn't ask for it and then the doctrine of judicial parsimony why should you do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.373" offset="19602954">But even if they had, you have no right to stop a secular act just like the conscientious objector situation; you make a special exception when the religious basis, the war goes on.</text>

            <text syncTime="5253.722" offset="21120355">And I should think you have too because in McCollum, you really had a couple of preachers that were really less, less of an establishment in one respect and certainly less in the free exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.157" offset="21162047">And now I'm on both clauses because I'm just saying the case controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.449" offset="21175212">After all in McCollum, at least that the religious material was pervade by private instructors and not by the authority of the teacher and in the sense that's less of an establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.058" offset="21217635">And then under the Free Exercise Clause, two differences are that in McCollum and this is important I think under free exercise, you had to volunteer to get the instruction which is certainly a lot less, I would think, a lot less of a violation than to have to volunteer out, so to speak, and decide not to have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.306" offset="21298615">And the other would be that you -- at least got your own religion if you volunteered and you didn't get anybody else's.</text>
            <text syncTime="5305.240" offset="21326409">And that the lower court thought McCollum because they decided this case of course before they had the benefit of this Court's decision in the Engle case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5314.144" offset="21362040">Well, we say that there is an establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5319.243" offset="21382416">In addition to that it is clear as crystal and just ingenuous to say that this doesn't prefer one religion over another.</text>

            <text syncTime="5329.828" offset="21424734">But certainly at the grossest of the broadest than any sense of the word it prefers Christian religions over non-Christian religions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5336.952" offset="21453260">I think it goes further than that and that you cannot do and that statute does.</text>
            <text syncTime="5342.679" offset="21476143">It is a religious exercise.</text>

            <text syncTime="5361.970" offset="21553256">And there will be many, many things read out of the King James Version will rule exclusively -- if you can separate the challenge but it will exclusively concern religious concepts and ideas without any distinguishable moral truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="5379.309" offset="21622638">Certainly, citations could be multiplied endlessly in terms of ritual, in terms of many kinds of beliefs that are religious in nature and haven't any but of most minor degree of morality.</text>

            <text syncTime="5413.813" offset="21760669">Mr. Sawyer what -- have you said in this word of argument that, well even if it is religion, it's religious tradition.</text>

            <text syncTime="5421.210" offset="21790239">Oh, Your Honor, that's just simply saying that if -- if the legislature for Pennsylvania has traditionally had an act that violates the First Amendment, then it's entitled to continue now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5436.070" offset="21849694">Their argument goes a little further than that because it says that the duty of Government and they use the word government as a whole, presumably to include the judiciary and then in the sense, of course it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="5446.945" offset="21893162">The duty of Government is to be neutral about these matters and if you decide to take this practice all out since it is traditional, that is being unneutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="5457.570" offset="21935689">Well, that just seems to me to relegate the role of the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="5461.557" offset="21951676">I don't know what the function would be as to anything that wasn't noble.</text>
            <text syncTime="5466.818" offset="21972679">And the fact that it's old has it seems to me nothing to do with being neutral or unneutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="5470.958" offset="21989292">We're complaining that the legislature of Pennsylvania has been unneutral and under the system we have, I think we've come to the judiciary to set the matter straight if they're minded to agree with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="5483.167" offset="22038089">And this could hardly be said to be unneutral just because in addition to those facts, the unneutrality in our view, it is the unneutrality happens to go back quite a while.</text>
            <text syncTime="5497.205" offset="22094200">I think the tradition is not to be stuck up but let me say this very candidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5501.655" offset="22112068">I think it is the final arrogance to talk constantly about our religious tradition in this country and acquaint it with this Bible.</text>
            <text syncTime="5512.834" offset="22156790">Sure, religious tradition, whose religious tradition?</text>
            <text syncTime="5517.072" offset="22173717">It isn't any part of the religious tradition of substantial number of Americans of a great many -- a great many things and really some of the salient features of the King James Version or the Douay Version to that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="5530.472" offset="22227320">And it is just to me a little bit easy and I say arrogant to keep talking about our religious tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.980" offset="22261384">It suggests that the public schools at least to Pennsylvania or a kind of Protestant institutions to which others are cordially invited.</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.864" offset="22296910">And I think to some extent they have been in our state and nobody and maybe in times gone by, that didn't make very much difference or that those that we're injured were no perhaps legal because of the newness of this doctrine, Your Honor, or psychological or even financial position to complain much about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.315" offset="22374651">But we have here in the schools of Pennsylvania, the conducting mandated by statute day after day as an exercise, the reading of the Sacred Book of Christianity.</text>
            <text syncTime="5582.256" offset="22434419">And I submit to you gentlemen that that is as the lower court found as a fact, finding of fact conducted there as a religious ceremony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5591.061" offset="22469632">I might say the footnote of that that the lower court found as a fact that there was a higher demeanor and standard of the Court that required that during this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5600.460" offset="22507248">Now, that isn't a bad thing if you're going to read the Bible honorably but it's certainly demonstrates again, if it's higher than other secular subjects, it is regarded differently and can only be regarded, I think, as a religious ceremony.</text>

            <text syncTime="5934.615" offset="23843882">Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, I will -- amicus brief as the Court has indicated a bizarre big thing, but what we are concerned with here today is a practice that goes back in Pennsylvania far into the days of its history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5953.311" offset="23918696">This practice as before the Court today is a codified practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5958.918" offset="23941057">The codification occurred in 1913, but the practice goes back deep into the colonial days of our State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5968.346" offset="23978778">The practice is not as the other as Mr. Sawyer indicates a religious practice; it is an educational practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.481" offset="24015350">It is a practice in the schools which has educational values.</text>
            <text syncTime="5984.968" offset="24045338">We've been talking about the moral values that are provided by this practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5990.846" offset="24068848">It is not a religious practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5993.215" offset="24078252">Dr. Boehm, the Superintendent of Public Instruction in his testimony in the lower court was asked whether this practice contained educational value and in his testimony at page 89 of the record states that he thinks that the reading of the Bible, I'll read out a few words “is one of the last vestiges of moral value that we have left in our school system.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6018.410" offset="24179085">This stands out, I quote him, “as a strong contradiction to the materialistic trends of our times.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6027.653" offset="24216074">Certainly, this practice reflects the religious origins and traditional religious levin of our public life.</text>
            <text syncTime="6036.366" offset="24250870">The practice of reading the Bible existed in the colonial days as a reading exercise and for the purpose of moral instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6045.280" offset="24286501">But it is fundamentally and has always been in Pennsylvania, educational practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.211" offset="24314295">It would seem to me that when you're studying the arts, you have to study sacred themes, you have to study sacred music if you want to be a musician, and if you want to be a good citizen and you want your schools to educate you that way, you must study morality and what better source of morality is there than this Bible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6075.245" offset="24406350">The legislature of Pennsylvania was codifying a conclusion that the people of Pennsylvania long before reach that the Bible is a source of this morality.</text>
