            <label>Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion</label>
            <text syncTime="8.224" offset="136234">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.136" offset="155878">I find Louisiana in a unique position here today because frankly we have no quarrel with the law as it presently exist at least in our opinion in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.855" offset="222751">I think that this case of Lombard here, is one that was largely determined revolved its decision on what the facts actually are.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.416" offset="285027">And they are so important that I would like to take a minute to go through the facts of this case.And then we can discuss the appropriate legal points.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.189" offset="348139">Now, the facts surrounding this case was the basis of a criminal mischief charge brought against these defendants are still in Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.601" offset="389726">Between 10 and 11 o'clock on the morning of September the 17th 1960, two Negro men, a Negro woman and a white man took seats at a 24 stew lodge counter, reserved the white customers in McCrory's Five and Ten Cent Store or Canal Street in New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.712" offset="474258">Now, McCrory's is one of the national chain operates in 34 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.451" offset="493171">It sells all kind of merchandize and it's open to the public and of course the statements I'm making here are born out by the record because I am following my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.742" offset="534340">The question of whether the lunch counter facilities in the various McCrory stores are segregated or integrated is left to the National Office of the McCrory stores to be determined by local tradition law and custom as interpreted by the manager of each individual store.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.419" offset="609050">And that's in a transcript of the record at page 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.488" offset="621275">Of course, as it has been point by Mr. Nelson, Louisiana has no law requiring segregation of eating facilities in its state.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.807" offset="658578">It never has had -- neither thus the City of New Orleans nor do I know of any single municipality that has such an ordinance in the state, back there is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.768" offset="698493">Now, the McCrory Store in which these defendants stay and having demonstration had separate food counters for serving food to Negro and white customers since 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.190" offset="740080">And as I said before, there is no law or ordinance requiring the segregation with these eating places and by operating separate lunch counters for whites and Negroes, McCrory was simply following a local custom as interpreted by that store manager, Mr. Barrett.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.718" offset="818239">An employee of the lunch counter at which the defendants sat down called the restaurant manager who informed these four students both white and Negro, that he could not serve them at that counter and that he had to sell them eating materials at the rear of the store were he had a colored counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.257" offset="908413">Now, when the manager received no answer at all from these individuals, this is the restaurant manager, he turned off the lights.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.790" offset="942582">He removed the unoccupied stools -- stools and he closed the lunch counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.887" offset="966928">A sign reading?</text>
            <text syncTime="217.093" offset="971734">This counter is closed was pointed out to the students but they remained silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.519" offset="993468">The restaurant manager then called the store manager and the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.518" offset="1013426">Now, the police -- it's significant, the police were never present in anytime.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.418" offset="1037040">The manger, Mr. Barrett, came behind the counter and he talked to the individuals and he asked them to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.270" offset="1068492">Police still was not in -- were not in the establishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.383" offset="1084897">But they neither answered in nor did they move the concen -- continued to sit down.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.760" offset="1110392">When the police arrived, the store manager advised the students in the presence of the police and prior to talking to the police that the counter which they were seated was close and he asked them to leave the store, nothing happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="281.872" offset="1230869">Up to that time the police were not involved in this factual situation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.291" offset="1252498">And when the police arrived, the store manager talked to the four individuals and he told them that the counter which they were seating was closed and he asked them to leave the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.571" offset="1297638">Now, as I said nothing happened.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.216" offset="1328253">And the manager told these individuals that he ordered them out of store and he asked the police to take them out of the store because it was his custom not to serve them.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.685" offset="1370154">His custom as interpreted by him.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="403.493" offset="1717373">So while -- while this is what you referred or called a criminal mischief statute that part of it at least is very similar to the trespass statute that we have in the previous cases, is that right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack P. F. Gremillion</label>
            <text syncTime="411.600" offset="1749765">Well, you might say that but it -- it was a statute that was passed by the 1960 session of the legislator, and was designed to protect the rights of the private individual on his property from the invasion by anyone regardless of race, creed, or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.135" offset="1827924">Now, counsel -- and I might go into this right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.672" offset="1838059">Counsel has attempted to tell you that there was a great segregation program passed by the State of Louisiana of that session of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.461" offset="1869197">Well, it may be that there were a lot of laws passed that was subsequently declared unconstitutional in litigation in the eastern district and subsequently in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.557" offset="1905560">But these particular statutes, these particular criminal statutes were passed as the result of District Attorney's conferences and I might tell the Court that as Attorney General, I've already made conferences for the District Attorneys in my state which is required to some states.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.330" offset="1964701">And we meet every year in February of the year and we discuss the decisions of this Court as they affect our laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.044" offset="1991555">We discuss the decisions of our Supreme Court as they affect our criminal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.640" offset="2009945">And we are always amending our criminal code to provide the situations that were never covered by law of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.157" offset="2040038">So there is no significance to be attached in such a fact like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.102" offset="2055816">In fact, as the result of the working with the Louisiana Law Institute, our Court of Criminal And Civil Procedures was completely overhauled at the same session of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.826" offset="2090715">So I don't think anyone can say that that was the result in trying to maintain the policy of segregation in my states.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.125" offset="2115897">Some of the laws that we amended we act quite a bit of litigation involving our registrars and voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.754" offset="2138363">We woke up to find out that no one could ever provide the material for the registrar of voters because until recent years, the office was relatively unimportant.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.818" offset="2174621">And it passed the law at that session making the Attorney General the attorney for the registrar of voters just giving me a little more work to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.889" offset="2202937">But I recite that to you because there's nothing in any of these statutes that we passed which would Your Honor upon recommendations of the District Attorneys and this act was drawn in my office.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.738" offset="2250376">So I don't know why it was put in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.513" offset="2257377">We never have a statute before because we never have had situations that existed like this before.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.138" offset="2279946">We never had the statute on our books that could punish someone for coming in and taking possession of their property, much like that someone would walk into your home and say, I'm in your home.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.383" offset="2324877">And you could say, Well I don't want you in my home, get out.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.762" offset="2338461">And we never had a statute to cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.230" offset="2348283">Certainly, you would have the right to invite him out and if he refuse to go out you would certainly have the right to call the police because he has no right to be in your home, no federal right, no other vested right.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.204" offset="2396139">And that's why we pass this particular statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="962.816" offset="3954604">At no time did he say that he was going to take the law into his own hands.</text>

            <text syncTime="986.146" offset="4047914">Now, Mr. Justices let me ask you this and this is one of the dilemmas that Louisiana face -- faces.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.421" offset="4073096">When we in cases of this kind call upon our police, which we've certainly got a right to do after an occurrence has happened such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.655" offset="4109981">If we fail to maintain the peace and tranquility of our community by the use of our own police which is paid to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.558" offset="4141641">If we fail to do that, we are castigated before the eyes of the nation and the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.745" offset="4162330">The first thing, you know, we've gotten marshals and in some cases troops.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.902" offset="4178944">Then if we don't take care of our people, if we don't use our police to maintain law and order in a community, we come before this great tribunal claiming that their rights have been violated as the result of certain sections of the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.498" offset="4241324">Now, what are we going to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.470" offset="4249266">The only thing that we can do is exactly what's transpired in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.867" offset="4266820">I say to this Court that Mayor Morrison is a man of moderation and so is Chief Giarrusso.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.213" offset="4296182">He'd been an outstanding mayor and he acted without discrimination whatsoever in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.187" offset="4316139">He had just run for governor in that law the Negro votes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.824" offset="4326693">Certainly, he wasn't going to turn around and repudiate him and furthermore I say to this Court that the President of the United States would have never appointed Mayor Morrison as the ambassador to organization of American States if he had it in anyway discriminated against anybody in the City of New Orleans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.443" offset="4389177">So I attach no significance whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="2140.918" offset="8667094">And looking at it from the overall picture, I don't think -- I think he was directing his statement to the entire population of New Orleans and not to one specific group to restrain themselves and to act in a lawful manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.425" offset="8729057">Now, that's what I get from it and apparently that's what the Court got from it and I repeat that Mayor Morrison is certainly a man of moderation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.663" offset="8766046">He's very liberal with his thoughts and I don't think that he ever had in mind the utilization of the police force that he's an officer or anybody to take anyone's rights away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.991" offset="8811290">And I repeat that certainly these sit-ins occurred some four or five days after his particular statements so it must have been a situation whereby these individuals wanted to provoke some action where they could come under the cover in the cloak of the Fourteenth Amendment and have their prosecutions voided.</text>
