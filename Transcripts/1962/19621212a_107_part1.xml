            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="5.777" offset="126516">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.310" offset="140622">It appears yesterday that the basic issue which lies at the heart of this case is whether and to what extent, the jurisdictional reach of the Labor Act extends to foreign-flag vessels which are engaged in the commerce of this nation and of also have other substantial contacts with this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.021" offset="247411">It is the Board's position that the Act extends to foreign-flag vessels which are engaged in the commerce of this nation where the maritime operation is either primarily based and directed out of this country or is essentially an adjunct by the American corporation engaged in the seaborne commerce of this country so that unbalanced -- so that unbalanced, the shipping may reasonably be deemed to be a shipping of this nation rather than that of a foreign nation which only the exigencies of international trade bring to these shores.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.736" offset="402265">Analysis of this proposition, I take it, must start with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.010" offset="423372">In sketching the jurisdictional reach of the Labor Act, Congress painted it with an extremely broad brush.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.154" offset="452002">The declared policy of the statute is to safeguard the foreign and domestic commerce of this nation from activity, the intent or necessary effect to which is to burden or obstruct that commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.782" offset="522533">The -- to this end -- to this end, Congress empowered the Board to prevent unfair labor practices and to resolve representation disputes which would burden or obstruct the free flow of this nation's commerce both foreign and domestic.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.822" offset="586689">The touchstone, the touchstone of the Act's jurisdiction is the effect of the particular activity upon the foreign and domestic commerce of this country and not the source.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.398" offset="644995">And as this Court said long ago, Congress in -- the Act reflects the congressional policy in the exercise of Congress' plenary constitutional authority over commerce to eliminate -- to eliminate industrial strife without regard to the source.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.694" offset="726183">Now, there can be and indeed there is no question of the power of Congress to reach these foreign-flag vessels that are engaged in the commerce of this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.771" offset="778428">Indeed, this Court once said that the power of Congress, the condition access to our ports by foreign-flag vessels that complies with what Congress deems to be good American policy cannot be questioned nor can there be any question as to a literal reach of the statute that literally the statute encompasses these flag vessels.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.575" offset="869648">Literary, the statute would go much further than you are now contending.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="194.578" offset="881664">That's right.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="194.948" stopTime="195.371">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="194.948" offset="883127">Isn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="dominick_l_manoli" startTime="195.371" stopTime="508.643">
            <label>Mr. Dominick L. Manoli</label>
            <text syncTime="195.371" offset="884903">Of course, we are aware that the literal language of the statute does not end our inquiry and we're also aware that a part from the language of the statute which is quite broad of course, that apart from the language of the statute, Congress gave no specific indication either in the statute or in its legislative history or in the legislative history whether and to what extent the Act should apply to foreign-flag vessels which are engaged in the commerce of this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.957" offset="987199">And perhaps as the court below said, it would be a bit unrealistic to a trade to Congress, a subjective intent to reach his flag -- this flag of convenience vessels that are engaged in the commerce to this nation because as I said yesterday, the development of these -- this fleet, this type of shipping has come about largely since the enactment of the Wagner Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.216" offset="1076224">But these considerations, I submit, as this Court indicated in the Vermilya-Brown case are not conclusive, nor decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.805" offset="1110601">What is important is the policy of the statute and that policy is crystal clear and it is the function of the Board as well as the Court to determine what Congress, given that policy, given that far broad policy would have done with a situation which now confronts this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.813" offset="1186670">As I said yesterday, the concern of Congress was with the disruptive effects of industrial strife upon the foreign and domestic commerce of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.836" offset="1234735">And the purpose of the statute comp -- is comprehensibly to eliminate this industrial strife.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.475" offset="1257305">Now, it can hardly be thought that Congress would have had less concern with industrial strife affecting foreign-flag vessels which are engaged in the shipping of this country or in the commerce of this country and which may reasonably be deemed to be essentially the shipping of this nation that Congress would have had less concern with the disruptive industrial strife affecting those ships than it had with the American-flag vessels where the plain fact is of course that industrial strife affecting one or the other will impede the free flow of commerce of this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.485" offset="1393351">Indeed, perhaps industrial strife affecting foreign-flag vessels that are engaged in the commerce of this nation may impede it even more than industrial strife affecting American flag ships in view of the important role that these flag ships as I indicated yesterday are playing in the commerce of this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.538" offset="1465553">Now, the problem of determining the reach of domestic legislation which like the Labor Act has broad jurisdictional coverage is not a noble one.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.606" offset="1553847">Congress has not infrequently enacted legislation which has had broad general coverage without at the same time specifically indicating to what extent such legislation should apply to activity which has foreign aspects, activity which may have extraterritorial aspects, or activity on board foreign-flag vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.674" offset="1646111">Where that is the case, where that is the case, the statute is -- issue of statutory interpretation must not be determined in a mechanical fashion either on the basis of the literal universality of the language or on the basis of outmoded concepts that a ship is floating piece of the flag nations territory or by slavish submission to the flag in -- to the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.500" offset="1741406">On the contrary, we think that the proper test is that the scope of the statute must be determined in the light of the policies of that statute upon the American and foreign interest present, the substantiality of one as against the other and a weighing of these interests with due regard to considerations of international comity.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.557" offset="1829595">This, as we understand it, is the teaching of this Court's decision in the Lauritzen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.303" offset="1852583">Now, in the Lauritzen case and that case involved the Jones Act which provides that any seamen may bring suit in a federal court -- Federal District Court to recover for injuries suffered in the course of his employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.173" offset="1908067">In that case, the problem was whether a foreign seaman who had been injured on board a foreign boat in foreign waters could take advantage of the Jones Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.088" offset="1947773">Now, this Court held that he could not.But the approach which this Court took to the question of statutory coverage of the Jones Act which again had this literal universal language, the approach which the Court had took this question of statutory construction we think has relevance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.792" offset="2018513">The Court there said, the Court there said that the flag is of cardinal importance but domestic interest, domestic policies and the substantiality of American contacts may tell -- in a given case, may took the balance against the flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.558" offset="2089566">Now, the Board in determining the reach of our statute with respect to these ships has taken its cue from the Lauritzen case.</text>

            <text syncTime="729.540" offset="3021511">But as against that factor, it has taken into account the following factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="786.377" offset="3248880">If, on the other hand, upon an evaluation of these factors, the Board concludes that the contacts with this country are relatively insubstantial and that the shipping is essentially that of a foreign country which only the exigencies of international trade bring to this shore -- bring to our shores then the Act does not apply.</text>

            <text syncTime="944.940" offset="3883133">However, we haven't -- we don't read, we don't read their decision to stand for so broad of proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="962.295" offset="3952515">The courts in saying that the Labor Act did not apply in that case, stress the fact that the ship that was involved in there was only transiently and temporarily in a United States port and that the only contact, the only contact which that flag had was that a labor dispute erupted, erupted while that ship was temporarily in an American port.</text>

            <text syncTime="1153.156" offset="4716022">Now, in this case, you do have contacts with the flag nation and engage to some extent of course in the commerce of the flag nation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.866" offset="4746846">Now, in at least three cases that the Board has had, and at least three cases that the Board has had that has been American ownership, foreign-flag registry and absolutely no contacts, absolutely no contacts with the flag nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.930" offset="4807137">Now, as I say, our reading of Benz is that it does not cover a situation where the vessels have substantial contacts with its nation and we are strengthened in that reading, we are strengthened in that reading of Benz by this Court's subsequent decision in the Marine Cooks case where again the Court in referring to Benz, stress the highly fortuitous context of the vessel in Benz where the -- with this nation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1209.189" offset="4940152">But in connection with that, this Court had occasion to speak of the Benz case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.228" offset="4956244">The Benz case as I say it again stressed the highly fortuitous nature of the ships contacts, the Benz ship contacts with this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.386" offset="4992920">Now, the argument is made -- the argument is made that labor relations on Board vessels have to do with the internal order of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.659" offset="5058017">And that it is the general recognized practice among the nations that the internal order of the vessel should be governed by the flag nation and the law of the flag nation and that in the light of this practice, we should not attribute to Congress in the absence of an expressed statement for the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.363" offset="5124786">We should not attribute to the Congress a purpose -- a purpose to extend the statute to regulate matters which the argument goes, deal with the internal or to the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.818" offset="5166686">We believe that this argument misconceives the internal order doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.604" offset="5189778">That doctrine which of course is an ancient one, has to do with the exercise and control of -- exercise and control and authority over ship, over the vessel, over the passengers, over the crew and disciplinary matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.387" offset="5260936">The classic statement of the doctrine made in the Wildenhus case by Chief Justice Waite is that the doctrine pertains to -- is that all matters of discipline and all things done onboard which affected only the vessel or those belonging to her and did not involve the peace or dignity of the country or the trend carried apart should be left to the authorities of the flag nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.059" offset="5367620">Now, we believe that labor relations extend beyond any internal order of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.451" offset="5409207">They affect the commerce of the coastal state or the territorial state where the ship happens to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.169" offset="5444002">And in the classic phrase, we think that labor disputes involving vessels affect the tranquility, the peace and dignity of the coastal state and that therefore it is not covered -- that these matters are not covered by the internal order doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.568" offset="5521638">Now, of confirmation of this understanding of the internal order doctrine is furnished I think by the treaty of peace that exist between this country and Honduras which contains this provision and I may say that this provision is typical of many of the treaties that this country has with other treaties of friendship that this country has with other countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.755" offset="5606379">The relevant article of that treaty provides -- this is at page 44 of our brief, that a counselor officer shall have exclusive jurisdiction over controversies arising out of the internal order of private vessels of this county and shall alone exercise jurisdiction in cases wherever arising between officers and crews pertaining to the enforcement of discipline onboard provided the vessel and that person charged with wrongdoing shall have entered as part of his consular district.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.538" offset="5713481">Such an officer shall also have jurisdiction over issues concerning the adjustment of wages and the execution of contracts relating thereto, provided the local laws so permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.510" offset="5769383">This treaty itself seems to recognize the matters having to do with wages, the execution of labor contracts -- of labor contracts that this is not a matter that is governed by the internal order doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.595" offset="5825703">Now, I go on to another argument that is made against the Board's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.487" offset="5849318">It is urged that for the Board -- for the Board to extend the jurisdict -- its jurisdiction to this foreign-flag vessels to read the statute as covering some of these foreign-flag vessels will necessarily invite international discord, perhaps retaliation and that in the light of these considerations, we should not attribute to Congress a purpose to extend the Act for these foreign flag vessels, absent the specific declaration by Congress to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.319" offset="6008665">Now, this argument of course is a familiar one in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.302" offset="6032593">It was made to this Court very forcefully by these three departments of the executive branch in the Vermilya-Brown case that if the Fair Labor Standards Act were extended to a base which is contrary at least in Bermuda that it would provoke all kinds of horrible things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.687" offset="6094137">The Court was not exactly overwhelmed by the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.576" offset="6109706">And I suspect that the reason the Court was not exactly overwhelmed by the argument because in large measure the argument is a speculative one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.199" offset="6144188">In assessing this argument, I think we must be mindful of the fact, as I said yesterday, that the great majority of these flag of convenience vessels have no contacts with the flag nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.730" offset="6190268">And the few that do -- the few that do as in this case only do so in connection with the American beneficial owners operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.175" offset="6224123">Now, in the great majority of cases certainly, in the great majority of cases where the flag -- where the flag -- where the boats never touches the flag nation shores, the -- any notion of international discord or retaliation or repercussions are perhaps more theoretical than real but to the extent that there is and I shall address myself to your question Mr. Justice Harlan to the question -- to the extent that there may be some international discord on happiness over the Board -- over the extension of the Labor Act of these foreign-flag vessels, we think that there is no solid basis, no solid basis for attributing to Congress an intent to prefer foreign interest at the expense of American policy and American interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.956" offset="6403218">Indeed, quite the contrary, if the peaceful procedures of this statute are not available for the resolution of these industrial disputes affecting these foreign-flag vessels, the result would be of course that the parties will deal after their economic weapons with a consequent disruption of American commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.141" offset="6479914">Now, we think that in these circumstances, in these circumstances, there is no compelling reason, no compelling reason for attributing the purpose of Congress to sacrifice American policy, what Congress deem to be good American policy to sacrifice American interest in deference to the conflicting demands of a foreign country.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herman E. Cooper</label>
            <text syncTime="2203.861" offset="8918810">May the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.778" offset="8926438">I appear on behalf of the National Maritime Union which is the intervenor in this proceeding and which in fact initiated the conduct by the Board which in turn has been suppressed by injunction by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.636" offset="8981922">In fact, we started this in November 1959 when having procured a majority of the cards of Honduran seamen in the Maine, aboard some 17 Empresa vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.795" offset="9034585">We filed a petition for an election with the Board and what appeared to have become a vain hope that we would promptly have an election and ultimately emerge as the certified bodily representative for the seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.135" offset="9087875">Two years later, November 15th, 1961, the Board ordered for this election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.368" offset="9116818">In the meantime, some four ships had dropped from the fleet and the status of our Union with respect to the seamen today is a relatively uncertain one, however, if an election is ultimately ordered, we intend of course to proceed actively in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.738" offset="9174288">Now, in selecting the Board as the vehicle for this operation of becoming the bargaining representative for the Empresa seaman, we attempted to utilize the orderly processes available to us instead of proceeding by economic pressure to accomplish the same result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.711" offset="9258193">Necessarily what I have to say will be a factual footnote to the arguments of counsel for the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.319" offset="9284629">I think that with all great respect, he has covered the important case law, the statutes but the one aspect of this case which requires amplification of the real underlying facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.706" offset="9338232">In this instance, the primacy of the facts, I submit, would deal directly with the key determination by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.021" offset="9375431">And these facts assumed in decreased importance because they were not available to any of the courts below by the curious situation that the Board record was not before the courts either in New York or Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.310" offset="9440632">It was not before the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.368" offset="9448887">It is before this Court by stipulation or by certification of the parties and therefore references which I will make to that record will necessarily be references primarily directed to the record before the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.311" offset="9508655">Now, the Board did not act in haste.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.619" offset="9521821">The Board had two years from the day we filed our petition to come to the conclusion which it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.759" offset="9550451">The hearing commenced shortly after the filing of our petition and it took two years, let me underscore this, before the Board and the Commission came to the conclusion that it had jurisdiction of this case and that it should order an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.987" offset="9615339">By the same token, it took the Courts just about a week or two at the most to decide that the election should not be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.851" offset="9646791">The absence of this Board record before the courts below may have led to the critical error which we feel is inherent in their decisions and that is the rejection of the Board's finding that these ships operate as the face of the United States enterprise under and I quote “the continuous direct control” and either direct or ultimate ownership of United Fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.099" offset="9743757">Now, the -- these facts assume even greater importance because if Empresa stands as an independent entity which is the framework in which our adversaries view it necessarily and therefore United Fruit is not the employee or even the joint employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.644" offset="9817945">It provides the whole framework of argument for claiming that sovereignty of Honduras floats this corporate entity and therefore makes it immune from the operations of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.429" offset="9869040">All of this is predicated on a Honduran corporation, on a Honduran flag, on the main Honduran crew and the fact that they carry Honduran products.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.950" offset="9907179">And we submit that while these facts are important, while these facts may bear on the ultimate issue that they're overcome by the real issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2459.695" offset="9942183">And the real issue is defined in the record before the Board that that captures the realities of the case and discloses the true relationship between Empresa and United Fruit and United States commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.544" offset="10001533">Now, what is significant here is that United Fruit is not a stranger for the National Maritime Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.828" offset="10022640">Back in February 1938, we were certified, 1938 as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for all seamen, unlicensed seamen aboard United Fruit vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.557" offset="10085648">It took us some eight months and wasn't until October of that same year before we achieved the contract with United Fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.704" offset="10118144">And we are and have been since that time, the exclusive collective bargaining representative for the unlicensed seamen aboard, the American-flag vessels of United Fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.141" offset="10163911">There are some 20 of them today and it covers some 800 seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.364" offset="10180838">And we will demonstrate from the Board record that there is a single fleet operating here which is combined as part of Empresa ships and American ships under the direct United Fruit control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.985" offset="10231306">And that while they may be dual flags, there is a single centralized control and that this whole operation is by virtue of the decision not of Empresa, not of Honduras but of United Fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.017" offset="10291388">And United Fruit itself has created the situation because by perhaps no strange coincidence, only three years after we got our first contract, they suddenly created the Honduran corporation known as Empresa and that Honduran corporation is the one that we're dealing with now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.142" offset="10363904">They own all the stock in Empresa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.444" offset="10373099">They dominate Empresa completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.859" offset="10386787">They named the Boards of Directors who in turn select the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.865" offset="10406849">The Empresa itself is a mere shadow of United Fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.790" offset="10426493">United Fruit itself as its well-known is a colossus which travels in four continents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.194" offset="10448123">It operates through some 50 or 60 varied subsidiaries of which Empresa is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.224" offset="10472260">Its main business is the growing, the transporting and the marketing of probable produce enacting as a shipper of cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.699" offset="10502144">The bulk of its trade is between Central and South America and the United States and it ships its own good and also solicits general cargo from others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.869" offset="10542895">But the produce which it carries is either carried in ships which it owns directly or which at time charters from others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.939" offset="10571107">And this is where its relationship operatively with Empresa comes in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.101" offset="10591796">Because United Fruit not being exclusively a holding company but being actively an operating company, also runs these 50 or 60 subsidiaries through this American central agency which in turn exercises close control and supervision over the acts of all of its subordinates including Empresa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.366" offset="10672880">And Empresa has no independent existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.110" offset="10683852">It's completely subordinate to the United Fruit and it could exercise no choice which is inconsistent with the decisions and will and wish of United Fruit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3151.505" offset="12709386">Ostensibly, the master is the one and responsible for the internal order and control of the operations of that vessel but the master himself is subject to the direction of United Fruit, perhaps not directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.023" offset="12763512">But as one of the witnesses testified on behalf of United Fruit, it would be surprising if Empresa did not fulfill a request coming from United Fruit and it would certainly be surprising if United Fruit would supposedly demonstrate dominance of Empresa, could not impose its will directly or directly on the master of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.596" offset="12853791">Because the master takes his reports and orders from the United Fruit Marine Department which is based in the United States and which is the overall agency which in turn passes upon and determines the operations of its entire fleet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.471" offset="12921292">It's this United Fruit Marine Department and this is the test as to what is the unit here, solicits general cargo business, schedules run, fixes destination, departure and arrival times.</text>

            <text syncTime="3235.599" offset="13045739">And the United Fruit uses these Honduran vessels interchangeably with its United States flag vessels for the same cargo and the same ports and the decision as to which vessel shall be utilize by this marine department does not depend on the flag but on the availability, the size, and the speed of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.864" offset="13138840">The supplies which go into these ships both Honduran as well as United States flag are principally brought in the United States from another subsidiary of United Fruit, Maritrop Trading Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.480" offset="13193279">The food is purchased in the same source whether it's the United States ship or a Honduran-flag vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.961" offset="13219192">They're both dry-docked and repaired usually in the United States as United Fruit decides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.062" offset="13243643">And as this whole question of do we really have an independent entity is sharply revealed by this following circumstance that United Fruit in this constant testimony of United Fruit, witnesses makes all decisions as to capital improvements or the acquiring of old or new United Fruit ships or Empresa ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.241" offset="13340296">All funds are advanced by United Fruit to acquire new ships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.407" offset="13357014">United Fruit decides the capital expenditures and substantial operational changes for Empresa.</text>

            <text syncTime="3351.032" offset="13507480">But I defy them to demonstrate another time charter relationship which gives to the charter this absolute control over life and death and existence and the dominance which is revealed by the record as existing between United Fruit ostensibly a hiree from -- a hirer from Empresa of its vessel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3398.551" offset="13697546">But Article XII provides that wages to these Honduran seamen shall be paid in U.S. currency, its schedule of wages is all scaled to the American dollar and it provides the defending payments that are being made in equivalence, it's an equivalence in lempiras or in the currency prevailing in the place of payment but the base calculation is the American dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.268" offset="13788453">All other benefits in the same contract, so-called contract, are similarly geared for the dollar and not to the local currency, the lempiras.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.180" offset="13824084">And in the same contract under Article XVIII, it provides that a vessel's requisition or under -- or not even requisition or under war conditions that the seaman get the identical bonus as to death or disability compensation as seaman employed in the U.S. Merchant Marine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.335" offset="13896704">However, the identification is not casual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.918" offset="13907048">This is not the normal relationship which you can anticipate between a so-called independent foreign entity and an American corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.714" offset="13938186">This is if anything a captive corporation, subordinate to and subject completely to the dominance of United Fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.776" offset="13970474">And this catalogue of facts, I submit, effectively destroys the image of Empresa as an independent entity and supports the Board's conclusion of full integration and operation in which Empresa and United Fruit are under the most generous construction joint employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.992" offset="14039333">And that this Honduran corporation is nothing but a tool and instrumentality of United Fruit subject to its absolute control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.190" offset="14076113">Left with only one function and that is to serve the purposes of United Fruit which in this case seeks to hide behind its own subsidiary corporation in Honduras.</text>

            <text syncTime="3514.991" offset="14163362">Let me give you the -- the pay to a Honduran seaman working side-by-side, ship by ship is approximately 25% of that paid to American seaman notwithstanding the fact that the same cargo rates, the same passenger rates prevail on whether the ship is a Honduran ship or an American ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.732" offset="14250297">Now, from these facts, the facts in the record before the Board which were considered by the Board for almost two years, they properly concluded and I cannot improve on the language of the summary made by the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.823" offset="14302647">Empresa's maritime operations are a part of a single integrated maritime operation under the continuous direct control and either direct or ultimate ownership of United Fruit and are an essential part of seagoing enterprise located in and directed from the United States and engage in the commerce of this nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.975" offset="14391254">And the Board further observed, that and I quote, “the relationship between United Fruit and Empresa is one in which the affairs of the subsidiary are designed essentially to further the shipping operations that are apparent and not one in which Empresa is considered an independent undertaking whose success or failure is gauged by its role in the open market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.763" offset="14482474">Empresa vessels are utilized by United Fruit as an integral and necessary part of its fleet of vessels and not chartered as an alternative to acquiring vessels elsewhere or only to meet particular contingencies that may arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.670" offset="14546004">In short, the Board found that they are joint employers of the affected crew members.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.847" offset="14570768">And certainly, as such joint employers, the effect of that relationship submits and subjects this company to the jurisdiction of the Board and entitles us to what we have been seeking for two years, and namely an opportunity to demonstrate that a majority of the crew members of Honduran nationality or otherwise desire to be represented by the National Maritime Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.200" offset="14672123">Now, let us examine, if I may, advert to its impractical consequences that flow from this controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.991" offset="14699290">Assume that the Board's jurisdiction is upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.798" offset="14710575">Assume if you will and as we hope that an election ultimately comes here while we're all still around and that in this election, the National Maritime Union emerges as the choice of the majority of the seamen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.984" offset="14763342">What happens then and this is a practical problem with which we are very much concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.894" offset="14786957">Now, we then engage under the law in collective bargaining with Empresa and with United Fruit or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.904" offset="14819035">They're not required by law to reach agreement with us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.845" offset="14834709">All they required by law to do is to bargain with us in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.362" offset="14852786">They're not obliged to reach any specific understanding as to any particular condition of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.951" offset="14879222">All they're obliged to do is to demonstrate that they're sitting with us and that -- within the limits where the legal or otherwise are contractual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.315" offset="14904613">They're trying to reach some understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.077" offset="14915688">What are we really interested in here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.327" offset="14924675">As the Union of American Seamen, were primarily concerned with seeing that their wage rates in some measure not entirely equal because this is unlikely but approximate more than 25% of the scales which we now receive and which their scales act constantly as a depressing impact and threat to our own existence in this economy, so that the practical consequences are that we will reach some agreement on wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.425" offset="15053093">We already have dealt with their parent organization since 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.449" offset="15069184">We don't have to negotiate with United Fruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.894" offset="15078902">And once United Fruit comes from behind as the side of Empresa, we're not concerned that we'll reach agreement with them and that this agreement will be as every agreement is and the accommodation by all parties to the realities of the economic situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3992.155" offset="16071973">If I may continue, the question of retaliation which I submit is not very real.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.969" offset="16103215">We have very recently, Mexico protested because we wouldn't permit -- the coast guard wouldn't permit one of its crew ships to sail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.033" offset="16131532">There's been international opposition to the Maritime Commission's implementation of the Bonner Act which seeks to regulate rate making.</text>
            <text syncTime="4014.127" offset="16159848">And you have Prime Minister MacMillan's threat the efforts of the Maritime Commission to regulate affairs of foreign shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.859" offset="16190777">The -- this kind of friction, we submit, insofar as Honduras is concerned, is within the control of United Fruit because United Fruit could decide tomorrow that there should no longer be a single vessel under Empresa and that decision would be rapidly implemented and become a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.569" offset="16273638">United Fruit could decide tomorrow than set up time chartering, it would bareboat charter and this whole issue would disappear so far as Empresa is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.974" offset="16307284">And United Fruit is the one rather than the Honduran government, rather than Empresa which in fact makes the decision as to the real relationship between these vessels and their ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4062.696" offset="16354200">Now, let's examine what happens if Board jurisdiction is rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.477" offset="16369246">I think this is a necessary subject of concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.460" offset="16385233">It will leave the union no other recourse but self help which we would approach most reluctantly.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.427" offset="16409057">This in effect would mean economic pressures in effect that it would neither picketing permitted to us in the Marine Cooks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.479" offset="16433298">It would mean that in -- of other cases, we would be thrust before a variety of coastal state courts and then we'd have to fight out the issue after each time a vessel was stopped, the port would be disturbed that a strike might spread in all of its complexities as these industrial disputes have a habit of doing and at the same time there could be no real resolution of the underlying question and that is the activity of the Board as an instrumentality of avoiding this kind of industrial strike on the waterfront.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.138" offset="16559940">And this is not the kind of in terrorem argument which I submit is characteristic of some of the amicus curiae briefs of foreign countries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.522" offset="16593481">This is a concrete and foreseeable consequence if we are denied access to the orderly processes of the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.858" offset="16626813">And I may ask with all due respect, how would a rejection of Board jurisdiction contribute to fulfilling congressional purpose of avoiding through the machinery set up by the Act, the domestic industrial strife and the rest, the burdening and obstructing of the free flow of commerce, the encouraging of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="4149.482" offset="16701315">The Court of Appeals below recognize that American unions like the National Maritime Union have a vital interest in labor conditions on Empresa vessels and that a labor dispute between our union or any union and these vessels would disrupt the flow of commerce to and from this nation no less than if we are engaged in such an issue with an American ship.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.648" offset="16809984">There's been some reference made to congressional intent and we submit that it clearly upholds Board jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.497" offset="16841331">And in this relationship, I would like to make reference to one point not raised by my friend of the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.406" offset="16869021">And that has to do with the antitrust statutes which have been hollowed by case law as representing authority for Congress to exercise extraterritorial jurisdiction and appropriate situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4208.006" offset="16935372">We were very troubled by a question which was asked as to legislative history, did Congress intend that it would extend the arm of the board into a situation of this character.</text>
            <text syncTime="4219.984" offset="16983333">We could find no specific legislative history because this statute is a statute of general inclusion and specific exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.844" offset="17018755">And the other statute which bears the closest relationship to it is the Sherman Act in 1890.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.786" offset="17046549">And what we did then was to take the Sherman Act, the language of the Sherman Act, defining commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.629" offset="17077896">And we discovered in this comparison that the frameworks of the Labor Act must have gone to the Sherman Act for the definition of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.321" offset="17124707">Because if you follow the description of commerce in the Labor Act and the one contained in the Sherman Act in 1890, you find that the language is almost identical in specific particulars so that when the reference is made to any foreign nation or any foreign country that the inference may fairly be drawn that the congressional intent when it framed the Sherman Act in 1890 and obtained extraterritorial jurisdiction through it or gave it and by the same token, the utilization of the same if not identical language in the Labor Act, accomplished the same purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.123" offset="17279875">And I submit that under U.S.C. 8 Title XV and if I may take a moment to read the language so that the impression of it is left clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.676" offset="17322088">The language is contained in the Sherman Act by its commerce as follows: This commerce is used therein means trade or commerce among the several states and with foreign nations or between the District of Columbia, or any territory of the United States and any state territory or foreign nation, or between any insular possessions or other places under the jurisdiction of the United States, or between any such possession or place and any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia or any foreign nation or within the District of Columbia or any territory or any insular possession or other place under the jurisdiction of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.094" offset="17479764">It makes it very specific when you compare this language with the language utilized in the Commerce Clause of the Labor Act that Congress might well have intended and I dare not to say must have but may well have intended that the same reach granted in the antitrust statutes were to be utilized and the statute of general inclusion and specific exclusion because under the Labor Act when they wanted to cut something out, they cut it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.052" offset="17591568">When they wanted to cut out agricultural workers, they cut it out specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.192" offset="17608182">When they wanted to cut out domestics, they cut them out specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="4380.009" offset="17623437">But when they were talking about the reach of the area of jurisdiction, they left it in terms of foreign commerce precisely as the language itself is conveyed by the language in the Sherman Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4398.786" offset="17698565">I would like to conclude on one note, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="4402.790" offset="17714552">We -- I argued the Afran case which this Court referred to with the approval in Marine Cooks before, Judge Bryan from the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="4412.303" offset="17752586">And we had the same problem there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.771" offset="17758438">We had this question, does the Liberian treaty superimposed its contents over the activities of American citizens in American commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.974" offset="17807235">And this engaged Judge Bryan's attention to a great degree because it had to do with not the extra territorial impact of United States law on Liberia but the extraterritorial impact of Liberian law through a treaty on the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4441.414" offset="17868988">And he concluded after viewing the authorities and listening to the argument that the treaty relied on in that case as the treaty relied on in this case does not confer upon the plaintiffs in that case or in this case or upon their vessels, any greater rights than those of American corporations or vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.676" offset="17966059">It goes no further than to place them on a parody with American corporations and vessels in the respects enumerated in the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.568" offset="17997615">I submit that all references that may have been made to the impact of the Honduran Treaty of Friendship with this country fall into the same category.</text>
            <text syncTime="4482.178" offset="18032097">It is a fact that while we owe respect and comity to the decisions, to the laws of other countries they owe us respect too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4490.619" offset="18065847">We are entitled to the same comity which they expect of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="4494.558" offset="18081625">And when we are talking as we are here about American commerce by an American corporation behind the façade of Honduran corporation, are we not justified and expected that American law will be upheld notwithstanding this vague and we call it threats of reprisal which are intended to defeat the congressional purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="4522.603" offset="18193742">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.101" offset="18227806">The United States has filed the brief amicus and obtained -- believed to participate in the oral argument in this case because the executive branch is convinced, not only that the decision of the National Labor Relations Board asserting jurisdiction over these vessels is wrong as a matter of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.169" offset="18308054">But more important that because we are convinced after careful study that if upheld, the decision of the Board will disturb our international relations and prejudice of the national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4566.167" offset="18368031">The Government urges, therefore, that the decision below in each case should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4573.394" offset="18396975">In the beginning, I think it may be helpful to draw certain distinctions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4579.729" offset="18422262">Much of the argument thus far has dealt with all foreign-flag vessels and it's been a considerable effort to speak of the Panlibhon fleet as if these were all vessels which have the same characteristic in relation to this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="4598.136" offset="18495927">This is not true at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.394" offset="18508988">One important distinction is between apparently all Honduran vessels and a large number of Liberian and Panamanian vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="4613.436" offset="18557158">The 13 vessels involved in this case, whatever may be our jurisdiction over them plainly do have a very substantial connection with Honduras, on the other hand, and there are only 13 but -- 13 Honduran vessels beneficially owned by American interest so that apparently there is no case of the use of the Honduran flag simply as a flag of convenience using the term in the sense of a flag on a vessel which does not carry the trade of the flag nation or have other substantial contacts with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4659.258" offset="18740433">I found it convenient in my analysis of the problem to divide the universe of foreign-flag vessels which are engaged in the commerce of the United States and necessarily also with the commerce of some foreign nation into four categories which are not perfect but which I think are helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.203" offset="18832175">But first, I would list those foreign flag vessels whose beneficial ownership is foreign and which are substantially engaged in carrying the trade of the foreign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4695.941" offset="18887137">The most obvious example is of course the Queen Mary and the other Cunard Liners or the claims of BOAC.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.535" offset="18925484">Everyone would agree that this first category of foreign-flag vessels is outside the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board even though it is plainly engaged in the foreign commerce of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="4728.018" offset="19015450">-- provision of the statute and clearly demonstrates I think that Congress did not undertake to show where the Board's jurisdiction was to break off in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.727" offset="19066232">In the second category, I would put those foreign flag vessels whose ultimate beneficial ownership is in U.S. interest but which are substantially engaged in carrying the trade of the flag nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4757.042" offset="19131538">This would be the case if the Cunard stock was held by citizens or other domiciliaries of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4766.547" offset="19169573">It is the present case because all 13 of these vessels are engaged in carrying the trade of Honduras.</text>
            <text syncTime="4776.476" offset="19209279">They serve the Honduran academy, indeed I suspect that they are more important to interest located in Honduras and to the Honduran economy than they are to the economy of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.270" offset="19264449">Furthermore, let me point out that in the case of a foreign-flag vessel which carries the trade of the nation whose flag it flies but there may often be as and then dangerously would be a substantial additional contact with that nation but the present case is again an illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4813.041" offset="19355564">The crew of these vessels is a Honduran crew, indeed it required to be Honduran by a Honduran law and it's covered by a Honduran collective bargaining contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="4824.351" offset="19400808">The employees are represented by Honduran Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="4828.305" offset="19416586">The crew signed in Honduran -- Honduras under Honduran article and it will go back to Honduras normally at the end of each voyage then they're released.</text>
            <text syncTime="4839.466" offset="19461204">The vessels are managed by Honduran corporation whether one pierce of the corporate friction or not, the fact is that they are managed by an office in Honduras, by the people in Honduras who have a substantial amount of discretion particularly in relation to the matter that we're now concerned with, labor management relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4865.409" offset="19564962">The third and fourth categories have to do in my judgment with vessels who's beneficial -- with vessels which are not substantially engaged in carrying the trade of the flag nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4883.359" offset="19636851">And I distinguish between the third and fourth according to the ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.237" offset="19656286">In the third category, in other words, I would put those foreign-flag vessels whose ultimate beneficial ownership is thorough but which are not engaged in carrying the trade of the flag nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4901.076" offset="19707695">The Incres case which is to be argued following these N.L.R.B. cases is a good example of this category.</text>
            <text syncTime="4909.498" offset="19741341">The vessels fly the Liberian flag and apparently except for that in the text and regulatory consequences have no other contact with Liberia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4920.184" offset="19784077">On the other hand, they're Italian owned, Italian managed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.964" offset="19803199">The crew and home base are all Italian.</text>
            <text syncTime="4928.986" offset="19819290">The only connection with the United States is that the enterprise is commerce between the United States and West Indian ports.</text>
            <text syncTime="4940.064" offset="19863594">In the fourth category, I would put those foreign-flag vessels whose ultimate beneficial ownership is in U.S. interest which are operated essentially as part of the U.S. enterprise and which are not engaged in carrying the trade of the flag basically or perhaps the best examples are the ore boats carrying bentonite from South America but not from Panama or Liberia under whose flag they register.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.795" offset="19986578">Many tankers fall in this category and some iron ore boats, other boat carrier to that carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4979.048" offset="20019597">This fourth group should be carefully distinguished, of course, from the present case where the vessels are carrying the trade of the flag nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4988.939" offset="20059094">In this fourth category, we must earnestly submit, is not presently before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4996.519" offset="20089396">The United States takes no position in this case because the issue is not before the Court and whether the National Labor Relations Board has statutory jurisdiction over foreign-flag vessels which are owned and operated as part of the United States enterprise and which are not engaged to a substantial extent in carrying the trade of the flag nation.</text>

            <text syncTime="5888.886" offset="23658872">And we must take it, I think, that Congress in the original Wagner Act left a literal universality of the language to be confined by recognition of the settled principles of international maritime law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5903.662" offset="23718013">I should say too that no additional light has grown on the problem by the amendments that came at later stages of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5914.756" offset="23762422">The Board cites Section 14 (c) (1) which was enacted in 1959 as part of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5924.299" offset="23800560">It provides that the Board shall not decline to assert jurisdiction over any labor dispute over which it would assert jurisdiction under the standards prevailing on August 1, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="5938.523" offset="23857507">We think this provision is utterly irrelevant really for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="5944.820" offset="23882689">In the first place, Section 14 (c) (1) was directed to an administrative practice of declining to exercise and acknowledge statutory jurisdiction on the ground that the matter was too small to be of concern to the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="5964.940" offset="23963146">It was not concerned and Congress at that time did not review what was the statutory jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="5974.705" offset="24002226">Second, Section 14 (c) (1) speaks of the standards prevailing on August 1, 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="5982.364" offset="24032841">Those were published, announced standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="5986.997" offset="24051336">It doesn't refer, I think, to each or every decision that the Board might have handed down sometime in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="5995.634" offset="24085922">And finally, one can review the legislative history of the 1959 amendments through every word and he will not find a single word that addresses itself with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6010.207" offset="24144227">In the absence of any contrary guidance from the Congress, we submit that the case is governed by the settled principle that the federal statute will be construed to recognize the need for comity and reciprocity in relation to international maritime commerce and to avoid conflict with international use.</text>
            <text syncTime="6032.999" offset="24235342">That rule is old.</text>
            <text syncTime="6035.932" offset="24247150">It goes back at least to the words of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in The Charming Betsy where he said that “An act of Congress ought never to be construed to violate the law of nations if any other possible construction remains.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6049.240" offset="24300335">The rule is laid down in a number of cases including Lauritzen and Larsen.</text>
            <text syncTime="6054.829" offset="24322696">Most pertinent here no doubt is the Benz case in 353 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="6061.298" offset="24348609">There, an effort was made to bring under the National Labor Relations Act, a labor dispute affecting a foreign vessel, foreign registered and foreign owned vessel in a port of the United States engaged of course in the commerce of the United States because she was beginning to load grain to be transported to one of the West Coast ports to a foreign nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6087.995" offset="24455398">In the Benz case, the Court rejected this effort to extend the National Labor Relations Act saying, for us to run interference in such a delicate field of international relation, there must be presently affirmative intention of Congress clearly expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="6106.695" offset="24530108">It alone has the facilities necessary to make fairly such an important policy decision where the possibilities of international discord are so evident and retaliative action so certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="6119.769" offset="24582457">We therefore conclude that such an appeal should be directed to commerce -- to Congress rather than to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6128.267" offset="24616417">It's unusually important, indeed, I think it is essential that to adhere to this principle in applying a law regulating the choice of a collective bargaining representative and the relations between employer and crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="6147.742" offset="24694366">But the collective bargaining relationship is a unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6151.637" offset="24709935">It's an integral thing and only one nation that can successfully regulate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6158.504" offset="24737416">In this respect, the current problem differs remarkably from the situation with respect to personal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6166.253" offset="24768345">There's inconvenience as the Court recognized in the Romero case in having the law applicable to compensation for personal injuries or vary with the port in which the injury occurs or the forum in which the suit is brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="6180.506" offset="24825396">But once the case is decided, that's the end of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="6185.887" offset="24846921">It's a transient thing and it does not therefore affect as here an ongoing relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="6193.438" offset="24877119">Now, the situation with respect to collective bargaining, the choice of representatives is quite difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="6201.577" offset="24909720">You can't have one bargaining representative in Honduras, another in Singapore, another in London and another in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="6211.866" offset="24950888">A collective bargaining agreement is designed to be a continuing thing to govern the relationships of the parties and exclusively to govern them for a year or two years whatever it may be</text>
            <text syncTime="6225.572" offset="25005641">.You can't bring men under one contract in New York and another in Honduras.</text>
            <text syncTime="6232.170" offset="25032077">Decisions about the bargaining unit have a continuing effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="6237.379" offset="25052871">Once the decision is made by one jurisdiction, the organizational problems within that company will never be quite the same as if the decision had not been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="6251.075" offset="25107623">This Court recognized this problem of representation proceeding in its earliest cases dealing with the problem of federal occupation of the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="6261.979" offset="25151300">The Bethlehem Steel -- the Bethlehem case and the La Crosse Telephone case, both decided in the Court, clearly recognize that it would be intolerable to have both the states and the Federal Government handle questions of representation affecting the same company.</text>
            <text syncTime="6282.212" offset="25232175">Now, the situation would be far more intolerable as between the United States and the foreign nation because the likelihood of divergence in the applicable laws is much, much greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="6297.237" offset="25292361">For example, in the present case, the N.M.U. could not be certified to represent -- under Honduran law, under Honduran law, it may not represent the crew of this vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6309.666" offset="25341994">On the other hand, Sociedad cannot lawfully appear on the Honduran law at least before the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="6318.448" offset="25377207">That's the reason I take it that it didn't take part in those proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="6323.139" offset="25395911">The provisions with respect to the bargaining unit and duties in collective bargaining are bound to be altogether different.</text>
            <text syncTime="6331.009" offset="25427362">For example, under Honduran law as I read it, there is no right to exclusive recognition, whereas of course our law gives the majority the right to exclusive recognition or if there is any such right, it is quite different under Honduran law and its goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6349.354" offset="25500818">Again, you'll find that under Honduran law that the regulation and limitations on the right to strike are very different from the regulation and limitations of the right to strike in the National Labor Relations Act that conversely the guarantees of the right are considerably different.</text>
            <text syncTime="6370.800" offset="25586604">As it's implicit in what I have said, there is a very considerable body of Honduran law regulating on the relations between employer and crew on these vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="6383.952" offset="25639163">Some of it is direct regulation, other parts of it deal with the rights and duties of the employer and any labor union chosen by the Honduran employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="6396.410" offset="25689004">Those laws are collected in the lieu brief amicus filed by the Republic of Honduras.</text>
            <text syncTime="6405.233" offset="25724322">This brings me to what I conceive to be the basic fallacy in the approach of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="6414.301" offset="25760580">It takes an egocentric, one might almost say a chauvinistic point of view, and repeatedly asked whether the vessels are engaged in the commerce of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6432.084" offset="25831737">Of course, they're engaged in the commerce of the United States, but a vessel trading between the United States and a foreign nation is necessarily engaged in the commerce of the foreign nation as well as the commerce of the United States and so are the vessels in this case engaged in the commerce of the flagged country to a regular and substantial degree and they're obviously important to that country.</text>
            <text syncTime="6460.750" offset="25946363">Similarly, the N.L.R.B. approach, wholly fails to resolve the problem of dual regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6468.084" offset="25975724">The Board acknowledges the likelihood of some conflict between the duties that it would impose and the duties imposed by Honduran law but it shrugs them off in the briefs saying, “This is a burden which the shipowner must bear as a consequence of doing business in a manner which subjects into the laws of due sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="6487.032" offset="26051480">Well, I doubt that that is very much comfort to the shipowner caught between conflicting laws but I'm sure that it is an utterly inadequate approach as a matter of international relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6501.624" offset="26109889">A friendly foreign commerce is to be carried on overseas, one must look at these problems from a detached point of view being mindful that the problems of interest of the foreign state as well as the problems and interest of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6520.105" offset="26183764">It is essential then, we think, and to the circumstances of this case and indeed in dealing with labor management relations generally to have a single internationally accepted standard for determining which of two or more nations with an interest in the labor management relations for the vessel shall have jurisdiction and which others shall stand aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="6546.298" offset="26288567">The traditional and almost universally accepted maritime principle is that the law of the flag nation will be allowed to govern the internal affairs of the vessel such as labor management relations and the relationships between the vessel or the master and her crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="6566.708" offset="26370173">That's the principle unrecognized in international law, in the decisions of this Court, in the treaties of the United States and in the consular regulations issued by the state department, the references are voluminous in the briefs and I don't stop to do more than what's referred to.</text>

            <text syncTime="6889.380" offset="27660936">Now, of course if one thinks where should the underlying distinction be drawn, it would seem to put quite clearly the labor management relations on the side of things which are predominantly of the concern of the vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="6904.480" offset="27721331">They don't arise out of the vessels relations with the literal state or with the people of its port, they remain constant including their problems remain constant as she's on the high seas or regardless of the port she's in.</text>
