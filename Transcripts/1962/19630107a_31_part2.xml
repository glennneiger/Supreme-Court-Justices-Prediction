          <heading>Argument of Archibald Cox</heading>
          <turn speaker="archibald_cox" startTime="0.000" stopTime="414.731">
            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.795" offset="146578">We think there are three answers to the argument that the petitioners in 51 and respondents in 31, the plaintiffs might make with respect to the county of origin and watershed statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.410" offset="209063">The third of the three that I want to develop, I simply mentioned the other two.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.463" offset="229230">The first is that we think that Section 8 of the Reclamation Act when it requires the Bureau to conform to state law is talking about the rights that the Bureau must respect in making a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.565" offset="281684">That is to say, you may not wipe out state right if the right exists by state law, you must take it but you can't override it, and that it does not limit the power of the Bureau and the administration of the project which would include the taking of rights under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.460" offset="353259">This we think is settled by the Ivanhoe case where the Court drew a distinction between the administration of project and the recognition of state rights in acquiring land and water rights of the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.410" offset="416998">Second, we think that in any event, the California watershed in county of origin laws have no application to the Friant Dam, Madera Canal and Friant-Kern Canal to that part of this project.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.368" offset="488887">We think that's the two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.631" offset="497873">In the first place, California did not purport to make its watershed law applicable to the United States until 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.126" offset="539878">And at that time, this project was substantially completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.282" offset="560462">Now, we think it exceedingly unlikely that either California or the Congress in enacting the Reclamation Act intended to give the state power ex post facto to control the building and taking of rights for federal projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.275" offset="632456">Now, the reference -- now, I invite Justice Goldberg's attention to this particularly.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.315" offset="652622">The references in Mr. Rowe's brief to congressional declarations referring to the state county of origin and watershed laws are very misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.509" offset="705390">If you read the entire statute, these come from the acts making preliminary appropriations for studies, the one on page 16 in his brief is for the American River Unit of the Central Valley project.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.202" offset="776129">Now, for our template in that, well, it's up here some place, way north in any event of the south -- the branch of the San Joaquin we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.382" offset="820851">And it speaks of a -- shall make recommendations, this is in making the feasibility report, which precedes construction, shall make recommendations which with respect to that aspect of it deal -- had conformed to the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.385" offset="892949">Our third point, and the one which I really think is dispositive and that I want to take the rest of my time dealing with, is that we think it is very plain that there has been no violation of the state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.322" offset="944671">Once that meaning is correctly understood, that assuming we're required to conform to them, we have conformed to them a 100%.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.077" offset="987721">This requires treating them separately and you will find a great deal of useful information about the state laws even if you don't feel bound by the interpretation, and the opinion of the Attorney General of California which is in 25 opinions of the Attorney General of California beginning at page 8, that's a general discussion, 25 opinions Attorney General of California page 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.522" offset="1109452">It's not referred – and that's it's in a footnote, it's not in our brief, and it has a great deal of useful background.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.450" offset="1145187">Now, it's necessary to talk about these statutes separately and I speak first to the county of origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.689" offset="1178102">It has no application here at all for these reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.798" offset="1202552">California back in the 20s, when water began to be getting short, hit upon a scheme whereby the State would acquire all the water rights theretofore unappropriated because there had been people who had made appropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.240" offset="1272351">There had been riparian rights, but California made a filing for everything over and above that.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.237" offset="1300355">Then the -- a state official was authorized under certain circumstances to release filings or to assign the State's filing to other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.186" offset="1352077">And the county of origin statute says, “No priority under this part shall be released, nor assignment made of any appropriation that will in the judgment of the Department of Finance deprive the county which appropriated water, I must have made a mistake but deprive the county of any such water necessary to the development of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.044" offset="1455522">But if we speak, it was a limitation on his power to make assignments and it was a limitation that he shouldn't make assignments when in his judgment the water was necessary in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.632" offset="1505886">Now, in this case, the United States did get an assignment and even if it hadn't, there would under this statute, be no right that could be asserted here under the county of origin statute because the only thing they would have the right to do would be to go to the Department of Finance and try and get an assignment themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.367" offset="1612884">They haven't been able to have done that so that we think that statute is entirely inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.815" offset="1642663">Now, with respect to the watershed statute, it seems to us that they add absolutely nothing to the case of the riparian and overlying owners for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.384" offset="1704939">The watershed statutes which are as conveniently set forth as anagram at pages 381 and 382 of the light-colored volume of the record, that's the opinion of the Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="434.581" offset="1841716">Well, perhaps, Mr. Veeder can give it to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.056" offset="1863555">I've got a little time left for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.230" offset="1884244">These statutes, you will note taking Water Code 11460 at the bottom of 381, in the construction and operation by the department of any project under the provisions of this part, a watershed area where water -- wherein water originates, an area immediately adjacent thereto which conveniently be supplied from water there from shall not be deprived by the department directly or indirectly of the prior right to all water reasonably acquired to adequately supply the beneficial needs of watershed.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.467" offset="2017259">This applies to the way the State Water Department shall operate its projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.917" offset="2055084">Now, assuming that it is applicable to the way the United States uprights its projects, which seems doubtful, it's still quite clear that it applies only to people who are hoping to acquire rights in the stream by appropriation in the future and they have the right to go and make a filing intending to show that they can use water.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.085" offset="2183711">This is made very clear in the California Attorney General's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.334" offset="2200743">No inhabitant of the watershed of origin becomes possessed of any presently vested title or right to any specific quantity of water as the result of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.007" offset="2239404">As the need of such an indivi -- inhabitant develops, he must comply with the general water law of the State, that is he goes and tries to make a filing in the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.937" offset="2279111">I'm reading from the opinion of the Attorney General of California, the one that I've referred the Court to a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.347" offset="2308786">He goes and tries to make filing, he must comply with the general water law of the State both substantively and procedurally to apply for and perfect a water right.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.602" offset="2349746">Now none of the overlying and riparian owners that -- may I take the liberty of going out a few minutes, Mr. Justice Black, None of these riparian or overlying owners have gone to make the filing and they have no need to make the filing, because they as riparian owners do have a vested right and the statute deals with people who hope to get rights in the future with the protection of people who don't have any water right at the present time, but who may later want it and the statute has an effort to protect them as in that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.238" offset="2532289">Now, what protection does it give them?</text>
            <text syncTime="610.878" offset="2546918">Part of the answer to that is in Water Code 11461, the first full section quoted on page 382.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.443" offset="2597177">In no other way than by purchase or otherwise as provided in this part shall water rights or watershed area or the inhabitants be impaired or curtailed by the department.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.702" offset="2646183">But the part gives the Department power to take by eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.031" offset="2671470">Now, in the opinion of the Attorney General and in the portion that it's quoted by Mr. Rowe, the Attorney General said, “Well, you can't condemn these water rights, any rights under the watershed statute until the inhabitant has gone and made a filing because these are future things and you can't take them away until they inchoate something, has been vested but he goes on and says in the opinion, once it is vested then it can be condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.165" offset="2824025">Well now, these people, assuming the statute applies to them at all which is dubious because it's intended to these people over those who have vested rights, at the very least they have their rights are vested, the riparian and overlying owners, and therefore assuming the statute applies to us, we were in a position to condemn them either by eminent domain proceeding or by appropriation of taking, and that to the extent that we interfered at all is what we say we've done.</text>

            <text syncTime="775.167" offset="3204054">My ultimate rule says that under state law as soon as these become vested, they can be condemned and that either they are vested so they could complete the dam here or the will of the risk, there's been no violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1160.193" offset="4744129">Nobody ever appealed from that opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1896.095" offset="7687711">Now, on the waiver of immunity, we are standing fundamentally on the theory that even on the case that's cited by the Solicitor, that when an administrative official goes beyond the powers given him by Congress as he's done in our contention by charging profit on top of interest then we are entitled to sue the local official and get justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.725" offset="7842252">Supposing the Postmaster General would charge 6 cents for the new price in stand, it certainly wouldn't be affecting the United States Treasury if somebody files a suit to get stamps at the rate that the Government has set forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2183.239" offset="8836368">The general position taken on behalf of the districts, is that all the water rights in this case which are necessary for the operation of the project have been taken that by that taking title has vested in the United States, but there is nothing further to do in these cases except you dismissed them in trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.008" offset="8931453">Now, before going into that general subject, I'd like to pause a moment on the question of the counties of origin and the areas of origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.904" offset="8970951">As Mr. Cox has pointed out, there are really two different sets of statutes here, the county of origin statute, sometimes talked about is a statute water code -- California Water Code Section 10505 which is a scheme for withdrawing unappropriated water so that it may be used in the development of coordinated water projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.485" offset="9057364">And assignments of those applications can be made in the discretion at the time of this case, the State Director of Finance, if in his judgment it will not deprive the county of origin of the water necessary for its development.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.655" offset="9113997">Such assignments were made in this case bearing the record in Volume 1 at pages 110 to 111.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.263" offset="9172407">The more difficult problem is the problem of the so-called watershed protection statutes or area of origin statute which gives a preferential right really to project service.</text>

            <text syncTime="2358.203" offset="9536136">Well, the answer to that appears in the statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.970" offset="9551287">It says, “In no other way then by purchase or otherwise as provided in this part, this is California Water Code Section 11461 at page 382 of Volume 7 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.508" offset="9597367">The vested rights within the area of origin can be condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.190" offset="9616175">There is no restriction in state law on their condemnation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2677.835" offset="10814673">It's simply a right to project service on the same standing as other users.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.533" offset="10837556">So in our opinion, the county of origin statute and the area of origin statute have nothing to do with this case any longer, indeed if they ever had anything to do with it and the only question before the Court really is whether these water rights have been taken by physical seizure through the operation of Friant Dam and it is to that subject to which I would like to address the balance of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.437" offset="10949151">Now, the way in which a water right appears to be taken by a seizure, is the same way in which any other use up front, is taken by a physical seizure or right to light or right to air.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.132" offset="10999933">It's when the United States demonstrates an intention to subordinate that right to the federal purpose or the public purpose and to proceed to implement that intention and it is not necessary for the implementation of that intention actually that the water right itself – excuse me, that the water itself be seized and then that connection I point to Gerlach because as Gerlach, particularly the opinion in the Court of Claims, but it is reflected in the opinion in this Court at page 755 or 339 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.535" offset="11149563">The taking in Gerlach was held to have been -- to have occurred on October, I think 21st, 1941, at which time the Gerlach plaintiffs were getting just as much water as they have ever gotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.669" offset="11210062">The taking in that case occurred not because they had been deprived of water, but because the United States had manifested its intention and had implemented its intention by closing Friant Dam to take those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.502" offset="11269413">Now, of course the importance of detention of water is that it may be evidence indicating the intent with which the United States has been acting and that is referred to in the leading case on this subject, the Portsmouth-Harbor cases which we have cited in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.061" offset="11339630">But actually, the intent may be proven not only by physical occupation of the property involved but it may also be approved in a number of other ways, for example by express admission and here, of course, we have a number of expressed admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.814" offset="11402637">To take some of them just chronologically, we have the letter from then Regional Director Boke in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.803" offset="11438582">By the way, the record has a misprint, it indicates 1957 which is obviously incorrect, it was 1947 when he wrote to the named plaintiffs in the Rank case and said, it has been indicated by some people that a taking occurred in October of 1941 and if you do not wish to lose your rights, you'd better act on them before the sixth anniversary of that taking date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.530" offset="11549445">Then we have the Rowes' letter which appears in the record in Volume 7 of the record, pages 5 and 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.297" offset="11584554">Acting Secretary Rowes of the Department of the Interior spelled out again but he decided that the rights be taken by the process of eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.487" offset="11617364">And then we have the McKay letter of 1953 during the course of this lawsuit where Secretary McKay spelled out in some detail his plan for the operation of the street and those two latter letters set out the McKay letter particularly with some specificity the standard by which the stream will be operated and that standard is that enough water will be led through Friant to have a flow of five cubic feet per second pass the downstream boundary of each holding between Friant and I think it is Gravelly Ford.</text>

            <text syncTime="3034.753" offset="12242422">Then in the Court of Appeals, it was held that the rights could be taken in this without equivocation and without equivocation that they could be taken by a physical seizure as well as by judicial proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="3257.650" offset="13133928">Yes and as far as the actual flows are concerned, you can get some idea of what's involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.418" offset="13173008">I made a little tabulation during the irrigation season, took the maximums in June and in the minimums in September and during the last five years, you find that in June, the flows range some place between 5,000 second feet at Friant and 300 at Friant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.643" offset="13261928">And I may say that it was that high at Friant presumably because they were still making flood releases in June or they may have been making a release to satisfy the exchange contract along with Gravelly Ford due to a shutdown for some reasons in the Delta-Mendota Canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.916" offset="13339042">Now, in September, you'll find that the flows have been as low as 83 feet per second and as high as something in excess of 140.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.826" offset="13386689">Now, the reasons why the flows vary in this manner through Friant is that if the irrigation season progresses, there is irrigation in the area largely from the Kings River as they are now indicated in our map and that irrigation causes groundwater to drain into the river so that in some regions of the river, it is a drain rather than a source of supply.</text>

            <text syncTime="3666.493" offset="14769298">There is no question about what the river definitely influences the underground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.986" offset="14787271">Indeed within the plus, the river in the area involved here taking of the upper regions rather deeply entrenched, maybe 200 feet at a maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.344" offset="14828753">And in that entrenched area, there is open alluvial soil, the water level in that alluvial soil is just the same for all practical purposes as the water level in the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.533" offset="14873475">Then you get back a little bit from the river and you'll find the water level is somewhat lower than it is in the river, but nevertheless varies to a degree in accordance with the river and finally as you get further back, there is no perceptible change at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.830" offset="14930735">Well, based on the study of the groundwater contours, a map of the elevation of the groundwater table, it seems to the conclusion and are still of the conclusion that the area affected by the groundwater -- by the river is a relatively narrow band extending along the uplands along the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.042" offset="15007535">Now, just how far I -- I really don't recall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.786" offset="15022477">The Court took the position that the movement of groundwater depended not on this groundwater claim or groundwater table but on the fact that Fresno is in the alluvial cone of the San Joaquin River and the District Court set up the hypothesis, groundwater moves from a river to the outermost boundary of the rivers in the alluvial cone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.041" offset="15099486">Fresno was within the outermost boundary of the alluvial cone, therefore, water moves to Fresno.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.134" offset="15119862">We have resisted that entirely and one of our firmest objections to the physical solution, Your Honor, is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.034" offset="15147551">The Court in the physical solution has reserved jurisdiction to alter that solution in the event such alteration becomes necessary and we say that the Court is in effect putting thus in this position and saying, “You've got to make water move against the laws of nature.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.291" offset="15220485">And frankly, I feel we were in the same -- the same situation as Galileo before the Peruvian Inquisition except not only do we have to recamp the heresy or we have to make the earth stop moving around the sun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.774" offset="15274506">Now, we cannot live with the situation of that sort, however, we recognize that - and the districts will be the ultimate authority and recognize that if a court in a proper proceeding for compensation finds that rights are there of people within an area which it believe to be affected by the river operations have been taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.077" offset="15367711">Like it or not, we will have to pay for it, but it's quite one thing to pay for the right, buy your piece and operate the project and it's quite another thing every summer, you have to get up with the insecurity that, well today, you're going to have to start releasing the full natural flow down the river and start drying up the crops and drying up the industries which are dependent on the service of the canal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.549" offset="15465618">It simply prevents -- this sort of decree simply prevents the rational operation of the Friant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3876.653" offset="15610023">To briefly answer Mr. Goldberg that it's merely a matter of dropping the wells a few feet, the Bureau of Reclamation's own engineer specify that in this area prior to Friant Dam from here to Mendota and they kept record for years 211,000 acre-feet procurated from the river out into this alluvial cone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.304" offset="15764564">And you can see it how far, but there's no dispute that 211,000 acre-feet procurated from the river to supply the underground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.999" offset="15803329">Now, when Mr. Goldberg tells you that five-second feet passing down the river is going to make that amount is arithmetic, is slightly erroneous and I don't mean to be criticizing either, but five-second feet means to 2 acre -- a second foot is two acre-feet a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.731" offset="15902281">Five-second feet would be 10-acre-feet a day and if you ran that all year, that amount would produce 3,630-acre-feet if I'm correct, Mr. Goldberg, circulation for the whole year, 3,600 as against 211,000 acre-feet.</text>

            <text syncTime="4106.243" offset="16528384">They have been during, I don't say they do it just on account of a pendency of this action, but they've been allowing 626,000 acre-feet a year to come down the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.965" offset="16583241">From 1951 when they finished the Kern Canal up to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.492" offset="16605288">Now, that would not show this yet in the destruction of a land.</text>
            <text syncTime="4131.133" offset="16627858">But the Court found that 100,000 acres would be destroyed and my recollection is that the price per acre, run as high as a thousand dollars and it means that the damage to the Government is $100 million as against the cost of the Government approximately 1 million for the check dam.</text>

            <text syncTime="4159.491" offset="16741334">I -- the State of California, the original Bureau defendants and the Irrigation Districts and the city all ask for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.192" offset="16792116">Now, if they don't want it, there's a provision in the complaint for inverse condemnation at paragraph four which the District Court has held for damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="4185.380" offset="16844884">Now, I seriously wonder whether the Bureau engineers want a ruling -- had a physical solution of doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4195.280" offset="16884485">As the Ninth Circuit said, a physical solution isn't for the benefit of the land owner, that's to give an appropriator like the Government the right to give him a substitute service by any means in the most economical and with the less use of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="4214.721" offset="16962226">In the Gerlach Cattle Company case, 11140 claims that this Board approved the doctrine of physical solution was of which this Court affirmed was approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.129" offset="17027845">Now, I'm not going to argue the physical solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4234.610" offset="17041847">I think down in the heart of the engineers as opposed to theorist in the legal departments maybe myself included, I think they'd be very happy with that cheap physical solution but I can't say that.</text>

            <text syncTime="4263.054" offset="17155636">Well, the answer to that is given in Nebraska versus Wyoming a quote from the -- my brief here, the same question this Court asked itself, should we get in to continuous administration of the stream?</text>
            <text syncTime="4280.771" offset="17226480">And the Court said, “Well, if it's our duty to do it, we should do it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.660" offset="17249991">Now, that in Nebraska versus Wyoming is cited in this -- in my brief, I'm sorry, I can't just put my finger on this but it's there and there's another case where this Court approved, the Water Master which was continuous.</text>
            <text syncTime="4304.905" offset="17323029">I know the way I feel, there are a lot of merits in that suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.329" offset="17344658">The Court still going to be in there running it, but the California doctrine of physical solution as set forth in the Lodi case requires the court to take continuing jurisdiction so that he can -- if he can, he can cut the water down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.913" offset="17419055">Now, I can argue if you have a feeling that -- well here, these engineers are running these projects and what does the Court in there for but under the doctrine of physical solution, it does give the Government the right to force a substituted service upon the riparian owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.624" offset="17513827">And as the Ninth Circuit quoted in their decision, that's an advantage to the Government, that isn't an advantage to the landowner because they can substitute wells, they can substitute check dams.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.675" offset="17578088">And if you will notice the check dam idea is in a general way approved by almost everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="4379.354" offset="17620825">Mr. Goldberg himself put on evidence that there ought to be five check dams and he cut it down to three when he was trying the case and the Government admitted that might be necessary to put in four or five.</text>
            <text syncTime="4396.420" offset="17689057">I'm not going to argue the physical solution part because I think there would be a tremendous damage action possible there whenever they cut down this 626,000 acre-feet a year to 60,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="4453.586" offset="17917680">They didn't intend to take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4456.596" offset="17929801">The Secretary McKay, he says, we go along with the State of California, and plan a physical solution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4462.806" offset="17954565">Well, if they're going to keep putting water down there, you're not taking something from somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="4469.029" offset="17979538">Also, if you'll notice in the Bureau of Reclamation officials' answer, they ask the complaint be dismissed, but in the alternative, they ask the Court to determine what lands are entitled to water, two, the amount of water they're entitled to; and three, to make a decree to give it to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4490.512" offset="18065429">Now, as I say, I think somewhere down the line in the lawsuit, the Government should be bound by the standard things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4501.499" offset="18109419">And if you ask me, I think it's just fairness and logic when they ask the Court to make a determination of how much water should go down the river, they shouldn't be able to later on say on a field, “well, we're immune” from what we ask.</text>

            <text syncTime="4655.506" offset="18725386">Now, assuming that isn't true, I haven't tried to press it, but under the Gerlach case, this Court held that when a -- the Government comes in to seek an appropriation of water in a state, they must conform to the state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="5704.658" offset="22922010">With regard to Fresno drying government, Fresno is not becoming one with minivan tire.</text>
            <text syncTime="5711.616" offset="22949804">Fresno is pumping more water now than it pumped 20 years ago or 12 years ago when this lawsuit began.</text>
            <text syncTime="5719.442" offset="22981151">They started out their pumping around 40,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="5724.096" offset="22999751">Now they're pumping 60,000 acre-feet.</text>

            <text syncTime="5736.883" offset="23050951">That's in addition to what they pump.</text>
            <text syncTime="5739.215" offset="23060250">So if you assume that Fresno needs a 100,000 acre-feet, when are they going to need it?</text>
            <text syncTime="5743.828" offset="23078640">Well, as I read -- as I read the little table on page 83 of Mr. Rowe's brief in Number 51, they're not going to need that hundred thousand acre-feet until sometime between 1980 and 19 -- 1990, allowing for 30,000 acre-feet of their well.</text>
            <text syncTime="5763.666" offset="23158053">So they have 60,000 plus 30,000 which is 90,000 here about that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="5776.073" offset="23207685">If they go ahead and put in a system so they could get the water from Friant, they could turn off their pumps and let the ground water come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="5784.540" offset="23241540">They'd be getting 60,000 and that would take their full supply for a while.</text>
            <text syncTime="5789.037" offset="23259512">As the city engineer who testified, I've made a little collection of these because I find them rather amusing, the city engineer testified at one time that he have to curtail service in some area of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="5801.226" offset="23308309">Where it turned out under cross-examination, he had to curtail service not because there wasn't enough water there but there was so much demand for it that he couldn't get it through the existing pipe system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5810.450" offset="23345194">I refer to five record at page 2179, but what concerns me is this 100,000 acre-feet and actually the impact of Judge Goldberg's question, because the problem is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5824.629" offset="23401932">You can't say, you can't say for the City of Fresno or for anybody else, you're going to need a 100,000 acre-feet in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="5831.474" offset="23429308">You could only say you're going to need 100,000 acre-feet if present conditions of growth, patterns of growth continue and these projects have to be kept elastic and you have a splendid demonstration of the last or future project here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5845.754" offset="23486360">The original feature is Friant, Delta-Mendota Canal, Madera Canal, Friant-Kern it's just the way up here in the north the best dam, the most feasible one built first, Tracy Pumping System.</text>
            <text syncTime="5858.785" offset="23538500">Now, the next dam, the next most feasible one was the American shortly north of Sacramento up here on Poso dams on the America.</text>
            <text syncTime="5867.492" offset="23573295">So they built that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5868.687" offset="23578102">This water supply is a constantly expanding thing when Fresno says in page -- I think its page 52 and so of their buff reply brief, I identify it as buffed because there are two of them in 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="5883.389" offset="23636929">May I continue for just a moment, when they say that they have no source of supply except from the San Joaquin River sir, that is not correct?</text>
            <text syncTime="5890.710" offset="23666186">They have a source of supply from the Central Valley project.</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.814" offset="23678621">They indeed what have a source supply from the state project which will be coming on the west side if they chose to use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5899.948" offset="23703176">The fight is not over, source of water, availability of water, it's over the price that's going to have to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5907.264" offset="23732433">Thank you.</text>
