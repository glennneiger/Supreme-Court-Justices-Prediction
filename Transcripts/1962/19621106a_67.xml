          <heading>Argument of Constance Baker Motley</heading>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="0.000" stopTime="14.172">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 67, F. L. Shuttlesworth et al.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.230" offset="124322">Petitioners, versus City of Birmingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.793" offset="142503">Ms. Motley, you may proceed with your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="constance_baker_motley" startTime="14.172" stopTime="323.111">
            <label>Ms. Constance Baker Motley</label>
            <text syncTime="14.172" offset="160057">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.321" offset="172701">In this case, the petitioners are two Negro ministers here on the grant of certiorari by this Court to review their convictions by the Alabama State Courts on a charge of inciting, aiding or abetting for violation of the trespass after warning ordinance which we have just discussed as a basis of the convictions of these students in the preceding case.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.202" offset="284191">Now, the ordinance in this case also appears on page 2 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.043" offset="319509">It is a very strong ordinance which reads, “it shall be unlawful for any person to incite or aid or abet in the violation of any law or city ordinance or any provision of state law, the violation of which is a misdemeanor.”</text>
            <text syncTime="71.723" offset="390248">Now, the records on which the state seeks to sustain these convictions, contained only the testimony of a Birmingham City detective, and this detective did not himself personally witness any of the facts to which he testified on this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.239" offset="480319">He was present in the Recorder's Court when these petitioners in this case were on trial and he testified in the Circuit Court on the new trial as to what he heard other witnesses say in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.807" offset="550640">Now, the entire testimony in the record in this case is very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.751" offset="574360">The first petitioner is Reverend Shuttlesworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.336" offset="588675">Now, the testimony as to what Reverend Shuttlesworth did, the detective said, was that Gober and Davis, petitioners of the preceding case, testified that they took part in the sit-in demonstrations on March 31st, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.649" offset="665997">And that they went to Reverend Shuttlesworth's house the preceding evening and discussed sit-in demonstrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.560" offset="713644">Reverend Shuttlesworth was present, his wife was present, and several others students were present and the second petitioner in this case, Reverend Billups was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.348" offset="760769">At this discussion, somebody prepared a list.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.868" offset="774875">Now, who prepared it or what the list was, the record does not show.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.902" offset="799013">The only other thing the record shows is that Reverend Shuttlesworth asked for volunteers and at one point said or announced, that he would get them out of jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.535" offset="849481">Now, on that testimony, Reverend Shuttlesworth has been sentenced to 180 days at hard labor and a fine of $100.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.454" offset="893158">Now, the testimony as to Reverend Billups, the other defendant -- or the other petitioner in this case, Davis one of the students in the preceding case reportedly testified that Reverend Billups picked him up on the campus of Daniel Payne College which Davis attends and drove him to Reverend Shuttlesworth's house and that Reverend Billups was present during the discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.842" offset="1010709">What Reverend Billups said does not appear in the record at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.110" offset="1031816">From the record, it appears and he said, absolutely nothing and on that evidence, Reverend Billups has been sentenced to 30 days at hard labor plus a $25 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.993" offset="1103391">Now we say first, that these convictions must be reversed because the record is devoid of any evidence to support a conviction that these petitioners urge the violation of any valid law of the City of Birmingham.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.120" offset="1179878">What they were urging was a sit-in demonstration.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.707" offset="1206209">Now, in order for this Court to find that what they were urging was a violation of some valid law of the City of Birmingham, it seems to me that this Court would have to find that a sit-in per se, as the court below finds, is a violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.686" offset="1274128">Now, as the prior decisions of this Court show, a sit-in per se is not an unlawful activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.888" offset="1302967">In the Garner case and in many state court cases, these convictions have been reversed or the petitioners have not been convicted and their cases have been dismissed, so that to urge somebody to participate in a sit-in demonstration is not itself a violation of any valid law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2215.028" offset="8963532">If -- it must not be commented upon to the jury but whether he commented or not, there is no evidence to negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.519" offset="8997491">That's the only point I make, not that he did negative that there is nothing to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.102" offset="9015777">And the Court in the Appellate Court opinion said, there's nothing -- have no choice but assume he was part and partial but he didn't get up leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.140" offset="9047960">There was no evidence of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.237" offset="9052348">There was no evidence that he recuse himself in any way from any responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.832" offset="9066663">But he did take someone there, he did remain there and these things were discussed in his presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.202" offset="9092159">I don't know whether it's a fact-finding of group of people gathering one person maybe standing over here just to count his own money, but I think they generally assumed he is part of the operation unless he takes the stand that it was of some strong defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.723" offset="9170213">Thank you.</text>
