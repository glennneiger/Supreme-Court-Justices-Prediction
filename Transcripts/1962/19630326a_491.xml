            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="24.103" offset="199764">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.737" offset="210317">I propose if I may to reverse Mr. Prettyman's order of argument into your first question on the merits and second with the question of appealability.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.911" offset="251068">On the merits, we concede that the failure of Judge Walsh at the sentencing proceedings specifically to ask the defendants if they had anything to say before being sentenced was not inconformity with Rule 32 (a) and therefore, was reversible error under this Court's decisions in Green and Van Hook cases on direct appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.050" offset="351587">I might say -- I think it's pertinent to note that that was not clear at the time in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.868" offset="378859">There was a considerable body of thought since the rule -- although the rule requires that the judge shall afford an opportunity that didn't necessarily require that he's specifically address each defendant, particularly where as here, they're represented by counsel and the counsel had made a full statement in their behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.400" offset="457017">Nevertheless, the Court so held and we don't challenge that.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.623" offset="469870">Nor do we question as a fact that he'd failed to make that inquiry in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.296" offset="508531">I think in truth, the error occurred only at the second proceeding in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.905" offset="539042">The first proceeding, Judge Walsh was acting under the appre -- misapprehensions as it turned out that this sentence was mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.956" offset="567150">He had no choice about the matter and I doubt that a failure to afford an opportunity to the defendant to speak would even be a reversible error in the case of a mandatory sentence, but nevertheless on remand, he should have done it and did not, and we agree that that was error.</text>

            <label>Justice Arthur J. Goldberg</label>

          <turn speaker="wayne_g_barnett" startTime="138.732" stopTime="149.176">
            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="138.732" offset="658265">Judge Walsh, at that time, believed not and so his error was in that belief and not in affording -- failing to afford an opportunity to speak.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="149.176" stopTime="149.826">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="149.176" offset="700061">Is that an error --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wayne_g_barnett" startTime="149.826" stopTime="724.121">
            <label>Mr. Wayne G. Barnett</label>
            <text syncTime="149.826" offset="702673">He was -- if he was right on the law, I don't think there was an error in it to say to let them speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.377" offset="720854">He was wrong in the law and that's why it was reversed and he should have given an opportunity to speak at the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.406" offset="748962">The only question here is having failed to raise that question on direct appeal even though they appealed from both sentencing procedures, can they in a collateral proceeding, brought some more than six years after the original sentence, more than four years after the reaffirmation of the sentence, can they then set aside the sentence in a collateral proceeding for that failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.436" offset="857109">This Court held only last term, 14 months ago in Hill and Machibroda that they cannot that the mere failure to specifically invite the defendants to speak before sentencing is not such a basic fundamental defect in the proceedings as to warrant a collateral vacation of the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.409" offset="960972">Now, I would deal with the question first in terms of Section 2255 and the Court acknowledged that Section 2255 was the proper procedure in which to question irregularities in the sentencing proceedings, but said that this was not a sufficient showing of the kind of fundamental error that would warrant the relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.411" offset="1072985">Now petitioners here suggest that there are additional circumstances present in the case which altogether do add up to a fundamental defect, a question which of course was left open in Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.450" offset="1129200">They point basically to two circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.536" offset="1141530">The first are the events transpiring at pages 20 to 25 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.201" offset="1200149">The -- after the first sentence was remanded for reconsideration, the case was called on May 15th, 1957 and Mr. Friedlander -- Mr. Friedman representing as he then said, all three defendants and he said that by the way in the presence of Mr. Healey who was normally the attorney of record for Mr. Donovan and Mr. Donovan did not object, asked for a continuance so they might prepare a brief on the question of the Court's powers in the sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.587" offset="1329716">A continuance was granted to May 20th.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.277" offset="1336508">On May 20th, the case was called and after the attorneys of -- the United States Attorney and Mr. Friedman announced that they were ready, the Court asked if the defendants were present, Mr. Friedman said, “No, they're on their way up.”</text>
            <text syncTime="323.722" offset="1398262">The judge said, “Alright.”</text>
            <text syncTime="326.154" offset="1407979">Mr. Friedman then apologized for not having the brief he had promised to supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.097" offset="1435773">The Court said, “Yes” and at that point, Mr. Friedman, on his own without any other cue, proceeded to deliver an oral argument on the question initially of the Court's powers on resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.532" offset="1497527">Now during the course of that argument which the judge did not object to, he referred to several circumstances that would bear on the sentencing question namely that they've been in jail for two years and eight months and he hope the Court would take that into account, and secondly, that the Court had at the original sentencing expressed some dissatisfaction with having to give a 25-year sentence and perhaps having greater discretion wouldn't have.That's all that he said bearing on the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.666" offset="1626049">Now, I would point out that both things were fully developed later in the presence of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.173" offset="1652067">The United States Attorney answered solely on the question of law, of the powers that the judge had.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.161" offset="1684041">At that point on page 25, the Court said, “Well, I think that's as far as we can go without the defendants,” and ordered a short recess to the defendants who were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.329" offset="1740675">Their first aggravating in circumstance, I say, that announced to a fundamental defect was the conduct of that short proceeding in the absence of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.337" offset="1792711">First of all, and if the answers are many, many arguments on questions of law, of course, take place outside the hearing of the defendant at the Bar, in Chambers many of the times, and that is not the kind of thing that a defendant is required to be present for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.653" offset="1874004">He is required to be present for all the legally operative events in the trial: the sentencing, the admission of evidence, the verdict and those steps in the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.053" offset="1927607">Secondly, this was initiated by Mr. Friedman who when to use the opportunity to make what he thought was an argument helpful to the defendants and how because the Government did not object to Mr. Friedman utilizing that opportunity he should now -- the sentence would be vacated.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.464" offset="2005243">I don't really understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.284" offset="2012557">In any event, even assuming that it was error, there's no possible suggestion that it was a basic error that it affected the outcome of the proceedings in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.827" offset="2058637">The second circumstance that they offer as an aggravation is the assertion that the judge was acting under misapprehension at the time of sentencing, and that the defendants, have they spoken, might have removed the misapprehension.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.431" offset="2145050">The facts of the crime don't appear in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.121" offset="2167829">From the record of the earlier proceedings, it appears that Mr. Donovan boarded a Post Office truck when it was stopped at the stoplight wearing a Post Office uniform that he had acquired and pointed a gun at the driver.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.592" offset="2245778">Now he boarded, it appears that he boarded the Post Office truck on a signal from Mr. Andrews, the other petitioner here who was standing nearby and the plan was to -- for Mr. Donovan to force the driver to turn into an alley where they would then remove the currency from the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.655" offset="2333968">Now, Mr. Cohen's part in the transaction, he was the third defendant originally and he's not a petitioner here, was that he was a Post Office employee who informed them which truck would have the money and that was his only role.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.013" offset="2391437">He did not participate in the actual events.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.495" offset="2409305">Now, at the sentencing proceeding on page 25, United States Attorney very briefly summed up what had transpired.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.674" offset="2450056">He recalled the crime to the judge and said that the -- there was a holdup -- the actual attempted holdup with the revolver was performed by Donovan.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.504" offset="2489344">The person who planned and helped execute the holdup was the defendant Andrews and Mr. Cohen's part was that he was the Post Office employee who informed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.485" offset="2533334">That was all that was said about the crime upon by any counsel prior to the sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.184" offset="2568129">The -- Judge Walsh, after hearing the arguments presented by counsel and why a lesser sentence -- why it should suspend the mandatory sentence then rules on pages 30 and 31 said that he has given a great deal of thought to this since the Court of Appeals has reversely remanded it for reconsideration and says, I have concluded that I cannot, in connection with Donovan or Andrews do that, in other words, the two men who perpetrated the holdup of the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.219" offset="2716296">Now petitioners say that he's confused there and more clearly later on in thinking that Andrews actually also got on the truck with Donovan rather than was simply at the scene signaling Donovan.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.698" offset="2786200">Now it seems to me perfectly clear that all the judge means is to distinguish Cohen who didn't participate at all from the other two who carried it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.713" offset="2826219">These are the two men who perpetrated the holdup and he explained that I do not think that I can suspend sentence and permit you to serve only the sentence that a person has to serve who was conspired, but did not carry out the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.210" offset="2892257">And as -- he says, as to Mr. Cohen, he's unhappy with the choice he has but he would take the chance and says, “Frankly, if you had been with the other two on the truck, I would not suspend your sentence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="710.985" offset="2947323">And it's that phrase “on the truck” that the petitioners primarily rely upon to show a misapprehension by the judge i.e. that he thought that Andrews was physically on the truck itself rather than he should be at the scene of the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1836.848" offset="7450728">Now in doing that and putting it back into the sentencing court, there was, I acknowledge, a blurring of the separation of a collateral proceeding and the criminal proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="2126.608" offset="8609834">And that ambiguity, I think, is evident in the language of 2255.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.557" offset="8633553">Now it starts out, it says that a prisoner in custody claiming the right to be released may, on stated grounds, move the Court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.341" offset="8688724">Now, the grounds stated are those for which habeas corpus generally was available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.887" offset="8710875">And to that extent, the parallel is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.523" offset="8725504">In addition, he may move to have the sentence vacated, set aside or corrected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.849" offset="8746820">Now apart from the word correct which I think have a special meaning in that context, the release -- the relief he may ask for is the same sought in habeas corpus i.e. to have the sentence vacated or set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.754" offset="8794363">However, note that it is to be brought on by a motion in the sentencing court and there is at least an implication as to be by a motion in the criminal case, the sentencing court and the criminal case and that implication is added to by the next paragraph which says that unless the files and record of the case conclusively show that he is not entitled to relief to have a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.598" offset="8893733">And that refers to the files and records of the case presumably only one case of the criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.190" offset="8912123">Now, it is finally -- the implication is finally extended at the end of paragraph 3 which directs the Court, tell the Court what it's suppose to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.594" offset="8957785">And it says that if the Court finds the motion to be well founded, the Court shall vacate and set the judgment aside and -- and it goes on, and shall discharge the prisoner or resentence him, or grant a new trial, or correct the sentence as it may appear appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.421" offset="9037093">That is to say under the -- literally under 2255, the judge doesn't stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.898" offset="9058931">He was simply vacating what was done that was wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="2299.345" offset="9300720">But when you put the collateral proceeding together, put it back into the sentencing court so that you don't have that necessary separation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2426.401" offset="9808959">Now, the first paragraph describes the motion where he may move the Court to vacate, set aside, or correct the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.831" offset="9858696">Now correct the sentence I think has to deal with cases when all you do is simply loft off the excess.</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.132" offset="9927868">So the motion simply asks that it would be vacated and set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.903" offset="9950960">Now, it could be that the order entered on the motion as used in the appeal provision refers that to order granting the relief asked for in the motion authorized to be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.047" offset="9995577">Now, in fact the judge is told upon granting such relief to go on.</text>

            <text syncTime="2487.236" offset="10052315">Now, I say that most consistently with the traditions of appeals in criminal cases, the proper way to construe this is to read it as giving us an appeal from the action on the motion asking to have it vacated and set aside, i.e. the order vacating the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.012" offset="10139460">You could, I agree, read it as given this right to appeal from the further order resentencing it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2608.688" offset="10538088">That -- I think all of those considerations equally go to the errors prior to conviction, an illegal conviction equally once you reach the result in Heflin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.786" offset="10590542">Let me say that the system of remedies in criminal cases is not a neat pattern and I think the result in Heflin does increase the difficulties of trying to make a rational system of post-conviction remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.592" offset="10657729">It was only dictum and I suggest that it is to be reconsidered as that is probably the more appropriate thing to reconsider.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.288" offset="10684479">I agree that on the law, on the development from habeas corpus, it seems a sound interpretation of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.942" offset="10715094">It doesn't -- it leaves a gap in the system of post-conviction remedies and the Government is cognizable of that gap, but that gap, we're not going to solve by the attempted use of Rule 35 here because that gap is equally present and much more glaring in the case of the defendant who was, he claims unconstitutionally convicted and no one suggest that he has a remedy under Rule 35 for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.799" offset="10830555">And the problem -- the problem is whether we should give preferred status to errors in the sentencing procedure as compared to errors in the trial and I see no reason why a rational system would do that, but the -- we don't deny that Rule 35 applies to the correction of sentences which are on their face illegal, a sentence in excess for such maximum for that sort of correction as it was done in the Heflin case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.905" offset="10986977">To end up on Rule 2255, the interpretation I suggested, I think is given further support by the express analogy to habeas corpus, the appeal from the order as from the final judgment and application of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.026" offset="11059493">The final judgment of habeas corpus would be simply the release, the vacation of the erroneous sentence and not the entry of the new sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.215" offset="11092198">And it seems to me to -- in the light of its history, its development from habeas corpus and the express relation back to habeas corpus in the statute, but that is the appropriate time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.277" offset="11144443">Certainly, that is the time that the independent civil proceeding termi -- necessarily terminates because this resentencing is necessarily back in the criminal case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2934.266" offset="11840449">The advisory committee noted that simply it was a continuation of existing law and what the existing law had to do with was what powers the Court had after the exploration of the term to modify its judgment and basically that was limited to errors appearing on the face of the common law record, the judgment role of the indictment, the verdict of the plea -- the verdict, the judgment and sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.567" offset="11973674">And as applied to the sentencing errors, that was necessarily limited to sentences that were not authorized by the basic statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2987.789" offset="12054549">Now even so limited, even so limited, there's an overlap between it and 2255 because that that kind of defect to which Rule 35 does speak is equally covered by the language of Rule 2255.</text>

            <text syncTime="3040.565" offset="12265618">It doesn't say anything about how it's labeled and in our view, the appeal authorization in Rule 2255 reads directly on the motion filed whatever it was labeled or one looks to is the content of the motion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3113.219" offset="12556204">Now, I would address myself very briefly to the -- what seems to me the much more troubling question where relief is of a kind which both authorized, namely the excessive sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3920.240" offset="15784312">It seems to me that forecloses that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.543" offset="15793507">Now, Mr. Justice Goldberg, I have not argued that Rule 32 (a) or denial of Rule 32 (a) denies due process per se because I have not had to on this record, but I can assure you that it's my personal view that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.654" offset="15866023">But whether it does or not, certainly, there is a denial of due process in the context of the situation in this case where you have the absence of the defendants during a crucial stage of the sentencing process where you have the absence of one attorney where you have a misapprehension as to a vital fact and I do not agree with great respect to Mr. Barnett's characterization of the judge's misunderstanding but I will not go into that, it's in my brief, with the fact that we have Donovan's record here and the fact that you have two denials in the same case of the right of allocution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3981.839" offset="16030699">All of these together, the sum total of the circumstances, clearly, it seems to me, amounts to a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.141" offset="16071973">Now the importance of the right of allocution in this case, it seems to me is pointed out by a chance remark that was made here that if you have a mandatory sentence and if the judge could not have given probation, why of course the denial of the right to speak was not important, not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4015.474" offset="16165282">Rule 32 (a) gives two rights, the right to speak in mitigation of sentence and that would go to the situation I was just stating, but also the right to speak in your own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="4029.627" offset="16221915">Now, in regard to the right to speak in your own behalf, that's not just talking about the sentence, this maybe the first time the man has had a chance to speak and that is true in this case because Mr. Cohen testified, but Mr. Andrews and Mr. Donovan did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.074" offset="16291715">So we reach the conclusion of the case, we reach this vital stage where these men are about to be sentenced and this is the first chance that they have had to get on their feet and say anything that they want to say, I have been defrauded, my counsel has not represented me, I want to get on the stand, this witness like the sentence is beyond the mandatory, the sentence is not in accordance with your -- the judge's instructions to the jury, any number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.412" offset="16416998">This is his chance to speak and I say regardless of what the sentence is, regardless of whether probation is involved or not, that man at this point has a right to speak and should be granted it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4156.506" offset="16729422">No, it doesn't but it's not his fault that the record doesn't show it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4162.455" offset="16753142">Well, I just wanted to make that point because when he filed his motion, you see, there wasn't even a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4167.312" offset="16772577">The judge simply looked at the record and he said “motion granted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.832" offset="16794728">Now, so on the question of full disclosure, the counsel for the Government says, “Well, there's no problem here because there's a full disclosure of everything they wanted to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.910" offset="16839032">The Government -- the defense counsel spoke at length.</text>
            <text syncTime="4188.567" offset="16857631">We don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.020" offset="16863483">That is an assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4191.211" offset="16868185">We don't know what they would have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.267" offset="16876440">We don't know whether there was a full disclosure or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.562" offset="16893576">As I've pointed out, they didn't testified the trial, they weren't granted the right of allocution the first time or the second time so we have no idea what they're going to say as of this juncture.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.005" offset="16939342">Now the Government says, well, they didn't ask to speak and they didn't raise the question in their first appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.687" offset="16974137">May I ask how they knew they had the right to speak?</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.259" offset="16988453">Nothing was indicated anywhere in this record indicating until Green was decided that they had the right to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="4229.124" offset="17019904">But further on their appeal, they were represented by the very gentleman and I do not say this adversely to the counsel but they were represented by the very gentlemen who were in effect responsible for they're not speaking in the sense that they spoke in place of this man and quite obviously, it seems to me it's rather strange -- it would be a strange situation for them then to turnaround on appeal on the ground that they have not protected this right of their clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.620" offset="17145814">Now, I'll say only one word in regard to this finality question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4269.584" offset="17181759">It's interesting that in the -- as you know, 2255 came as -- came about as a result of rec -- number of recommendations from the judicial conference which finally resolved in an extended bills before Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.397" offset="17241004">And one of the original suggestions that was made by the judicial conference as the language for rules or for Section 2255 and this appears in the report for 1953 -- 1943 I am sorry on page 44, “the wording in regard to appealability was an appeal from an order granting or denying the motion shall lie to the Circuit Court of Appeals.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.991" offset="17355316">Now, I cannot find in the legislative history the reason why that was changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.286" offset="17372557">The legislative history is somewhat involved here, but it was changed and it was obviously changed with a view to adding this idea of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4327.554" offset="17413622">They didn't want 2255 appeals to lie simply from an order entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4334.169" offset="17440057">They wanted to lie only from final order and that was the language they used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4340.460" offset="17465240">Now here, we have a situation where the order was entered whether it would be Rule 35 or 2255 which both vacated sentences and ordered resentencing and that I say did not on its face and in effect have any semblance of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.069" offset="17551653">Now, in conclusion, I think we ought to look finally the end of this case as a practical matter that what is involved here and what the Government is asking you to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4376.301" offset="17608600">What is the effect of allowing the Government an appeal in this type of situation?</text>
            <text syncTime="4382.963" offset="17635244">Since these petitioners have now served their five-year sentence, remember that was on count three, every single day that passes now in this interlocutory appeal stage is a day which these defendants if they could prove to the District Court on resentencing that they were entitled to probation, everyday that goes by is a day that they would be free.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.265" offset="17760423">In the case of short sentences, the Government can totally defeat the right of resentencing by the simple act of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4423.457" offset="17797204">You get a man who is sentenced to a year-and-a-half which has been the time since the order of Judge Murphy was entered and the Government notes its appeal, it takes its time, it writes its brief, it goes up, receives cert, and then at the end of that time, the order of resentencing was correct, too late, it's all over.</text>
            <text syncTime="4446.963" offset="17891244">That's what the Government is asking you to do in this case and I think that the figures which I cited to you at the end of yesterday, in terms of the time the Government sought in the last fiscal year, any type of repeal, namely none is an indication not only that this right is not necessary and that they do not really need it, but as shown by the facts of this case that it actually denies the right which we're all seeking to protect.</text>
