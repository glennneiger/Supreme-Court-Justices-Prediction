            <label>Mr. Newell Edenfield</label>
            <text syncTime="170.329" offset="784697">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.729" offset="794311">I have some authority on that which I'd like to present consisting of a Shanferokee case which I mentioned yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.401" offset="829001">I think that is the only case where this Court in a full bench decision has ever discussed the relationship between Sections 3 and Section 4 of the Arbitration Act and I believe that decision puts the question at rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.035" offset="887515">Now, the Shanferokee case is cited in our brief but it was not cited on this point because the conflict or possible conflict between 3 and 4 was not mentioned or had not been raised until yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.313" offset="940596">For that reason, I would like to discuss it just a minute and to read what the Court said, what this Court says as to relationship between Sections 3 and Section 4 of the Arbitration Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.624" offset="985840">Now Shanferokee, if the Court please, involved an interstate sale of coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.793" offset="1010500">The defendant was sued by the plaintiff and upon being sued, he sought to pend -- to stay the action pending arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.367" offset="1044877">Now as to what happened in the court below, this Court said and I'm reading from 293 U.S., page 451, this is mere recital of what happened in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.458" offset="1089181">The District Court interpreted the clause that is the Arbitration Clause as making the arbitration enforceable only in the State Courts of New York and on that ground denied the stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.158" offset="1144038">On appeal from the order of denial, the Court of Appeals held that even if the clause should be so interpreted, Section 3 of the United States Arbitration Act authorized the stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.248" offset="1188342">It, therefore, reversed the order and direct to the District Court to grant the stay and would leave and so forth and this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.839" offset="1222719">So we had a situation there where there was an application for a stay under Section 3, the court felt like that Section 4 would go to be enforced in New York that it couldn't grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.624" offset="1261902">Now, in dealing with relation with that question and relationship between Sections 3 relating to stay and Section 4 relating to enforcement, this Court says, “The plaintiff contends that the District Court was without power to grant the stay because the contract provides that arbitration can be compelled only by proceedings in a State Court of New York.”</text>
            <text syncTime="314.752" offset="1362422">The provision here is that, “Either party may apply to the Supreme Court of the State of New York for an order compelling specific performance of this arbitration agreement in accordance with the arbitration law of the State of New York.”</text>
            <text syncTime="328.956" offset="1419160">The contract does not in terms prohibit proceedings in the federal court whether it should be construed so as to exclude the bringing of a suit in the federal court to compel specific performance of the agreement arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.978" offset="1471300">We have no occasion to decide for the District Court was not asked this in the proceeding now under review to compel specific performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.179" offset="1508080">The motion was to stay the action until arbitration shall have been had and the direction of the Court of Appeals was limited to granting a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.044" offset="1543502">Now, if it please the Court, we've come to what this -- this Court said about relationship between Sections 3 and 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.352" offset="1572760">Section 3 of the United States Arbitration Act provides the broadly that the Court may, “Stay the trial of the action until such arbitration had been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="381.298" offset="1628557">We think the Court of Appeals was clearly right in concluding that there is no reason to imply that power to grant a stay is conditioned upon the existence of power to compel arbitration in accordance with Section 4 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.519" offset="1697416">Marine Transit versus Dreyfus if not to the contrary, there is on the other hand strong reason for construing the clause as permitting the federal court to order a stay even when it cannot compel the arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.340" offset="1756766">But otherwise, despite congressional approval of arbitration, it would be impossible to secure a stay of an action in the federal courts when the arbitration agreement provides for compulsory proceedings exclusively in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.798" offset="1814549">So it seems to me, like what the court is saying, if the Court please, is that under Section 3, you can grant a stay which is what is here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.832" offset="1854673">Irrespective of whether or not the Court would have jurisdiction to enforce under Section 4, and incidentally in the Circuit Court, Judge Learned Hand in the same case before it got here, made this remark which was confirmed by what I've just read and this appears from page 297 of 70 F.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.970" offset="1947251">We see no reason for a limited construction, that is of the United States Arbitration Act, and conclude that Section 3 authorizes a stay even though the arbitration must take place beyond the jurisdiction of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.177" offset="2016110">So it seems to me that a right to a stay under Section 3 is unrelated to and fully independent of Section 4.</text>

            <text syncTime="786.910" offset="3250970">The main opinion in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals incidentally cites other instances and the Lower Federal Courts, I'll admit, flatly holding that the venue provisions of the Miller Act can be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.809" offset="3302588">Not a word is there said in the Miller Act prohibiting arbitration then you can be waived and incidentally, that is the next point which I wanted to address myself is what is this provision in the Miller Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="813.444" offset="3357132">Is it simply a venue provision which can be waived or is it as Mr. Grant says on any group part of a new federal right which prescribes not only the right but the remedy by which is to be invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.165" offset="3416064">Now, that is the thrust of his argument and his main argument, I may add.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.321" offset="3436648">He says and his contention is relying on this provision in the Miller Act that suit shall be brought here and not elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.227" offset="3468309">And that it may be prosecuted there to final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.646" offset="3485968">And that that is a mandate first that you can't do it anywhere else, and second that means you cannot arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.119" offset="3519822">Now I agree with the principle of law which he cites that where Congress creates a new right unknown to the common law and as an integral part of that right, Congress prescribes a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.853" offset="3574784">The right becomes -- the remedy becomes a part of the right and the right can only be enforced in a manner prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.940" offset="3603101">Mr. Grant cites and I agree with those cases, the case of Wilko versus Swan.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.382" offset="3628910">In that case, there was a suit under -- for a violation of the marginal of the provisions of the Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.887" offset="3662869">Now there was no such suit in common law, the Securities Act created the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.524" offset="3685439">It not only prescribed a venue provision but it provided for a non-waiver provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.108" offset="3707800">And I think clearly having -- Congress having provided a new right and having prescribed the venue provision and having gone further and put in a non-waiver provision, you had to follow it as this Court held in the Wilko case and exactly the same way in the Griffith Saving Bank case which Mr. Grant cites.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.077" offset="3783659">That was a Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.549" offset="3793586">There was no such cause of action as the Fair Labor Standards suit at common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.357" offset="3812812">Congress created the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.473" offset="3821275">In creating the right, they made as a part of it as an integral part of it a venue statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1122.258" offset="4592410">And since there was to be but one suit on behalf of everybody, of course, there had to be someplace specified where was it to be brought and therefore, the Heard Act first contained this language that it should be brought in a district where part of the work was performed and that it should be -- could -- could be prosecuted to final judgment right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2395.169" offset="9684093">And I would say one thing, if the interpretation of Mr. Grant and I'm trying to get back now to where I was awhile ago, if the interpretation argued by Mr. Grant is sustained, the effect of it will be, if the Court please, to imply the repeal to the Arbitration Act to the extent of Miller Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.180" offset="9760057">In fact, that itself is what Mr. Grant argues in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.330" offset="9776671">He said that arbitration act was passed first, now the Miller Act was passed second with these unusual provisions about why you bring a suit and prosecute under final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.524" offset="9821497">And to that extent, the Arbitration Act, you go then to say to a repeal pro tanto, but in substance, he said that, that takes the Miller Act cases out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.418" offset="9857024">Well, of course, that argument in the first place implied repeals are not favored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.908" offset="9878967">If my theory is correct, they can be harmonized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.531" offset="9893491">And furthermore, while it's true that the Arbitration Act was passed before the Miller Act, and therefore, there might be an implied repeal by the later Act, the Arbitration Act was subsequently enacted as substantive law in 1947, 12 years after the passage of the Miller Act and not a syllable in it was changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.748" offset="9986382">So, Congress had not only said that that was their policy as far as the Arbitration Act is concerned, they've never said there was any exception in Miller Act cases, and after the Miller Act, they have repeated it in exactly the same language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.328" offset="10044688">So that I say that what he is seeking to do, would be to work an implied repeal and that in spite of the fact that Congress had reenacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.470" offset="10077288">Now, if the Court please, I don't know what my time is but I want to move on to this business of fraud just a minute, if I may, which was argued by Mr. Grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.639" offset="10113964">I am sure the Court would be aware, how easy it would be to destroy any policy of arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.269" offset="10148446">If it could be furthered the way in every case by having the unwilling party come forward and say it was obtained by deceptive fraud, however ground this or however frivolous.</text>

            <text syncTime="2562.620" offset="10353873">But there was a very interesting case, Devonshire Fabrics which is cited in our brief, where that question did come up and was considered by Judge Medina in New York and incidentally, this Court granted certiorari and as our judge, the case must have been settled because it never, I mean, it was declared moot or something or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.703" offset="10442167">But in any rate, in that case, Judge Medina flatly holds that in order to -- for fraud to prevent arbitration, the arbitration provision must itself have been obtained by fraud.</text>

            <text syncTime="3144.062" offset="12679607">And that he can see -- this whole contract, 13 pages of fine print, hadn't got but one single thing in it that the main contractor promises to do, every other paragraph as an agreement that the subcontractor shall not, but his one obligation was to pay and to pay promptly under that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.972" offset="12755257">And we say he conceived this scheme to avoid that payment and that one means by which he intended to avoid it was by use, by insertion of and use of this arbitration provision that when a claim arose and the man says, “I'm entitled of $90,000 you haven't paid”, that he would say, “Well, I'm not going to pay you.</text>
