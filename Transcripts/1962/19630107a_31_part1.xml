            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="43.616" offset="277817">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.769" offset="290461">This is one of three cases here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, all growing out of a single action brought against the United States and officials of the Bureau of Reclamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.746" offset="350333">The central issue is whether the action in all its aspects is in reality, a suit against the United States barred by sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.209" offset="404250">Our position is that it is such an action and is so barred and that the plaintiffs have a remedy for damages under the Tucker Act in a suit in the Court of Claims but they're not -- but they're not entitled to this action for a specific relief under the doctrine of the Larson case and Malone and Bowdoin.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.084" offset="495679">The justices, who were on the Court at the time of the Gerlach and Ivanhoe cases, will recall the complexity and grandeur of the Central Valley project.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.447" offset="537161">The north half of the Central Valley in California, the Sacramento Valley, has a surplus of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.739" offset="570284">The south half, the San Joaquin Valley, has a shortage of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.673" offset="594108">The purpose of the project, the essence was to improve the use of water in both halves of the valley, but also particularly to bring surplus down to the water hungry regions in the San Joaquin.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.858" offset="658787">For present purposes, there are only two units of the project that are important to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.407" offset="688985">Both were the key units in the sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.536" offset="705494">The San Joaquin River rises in the Sierras in the area just south of the Yosemite and then flows southwesterly and breaks through the mountains here at Friant.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.723" offset="766307">Then it continues on, flowing a little bit more to the west and then take a sharp bend up to the northwest and it -- in the delta area, it joins the Sacramento and the two flow out through the Golden Gate to the sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.605" offset="829837">The first unit that we're concerned with is the Friant Dam which was built right here where the river breaks through the mountains and behind which is Millerton Lake, a storage reservoir.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.816" offset="894621">Extending from that dam north is the Madera Canal and south the Friant-Kern Canal, which transports water to regions that otherwise, would be shortage areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.391" offset="952926">And they take, when the dam is close, all or virtually all the water of the San Joaquin.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.233" offset="984273">The Irrigation District which are the petitioners in the third case to be heard today are the districts that are furnished by these two canals, one runs about 50 miles and the other about 150.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.512" offset="1041429">Now closing the Friant Dam and diverting the water via the canal would of course unless something else was done, cut off the irrigation water available to the lower San Joaquin Valley.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.772" offset="1102451">To take care of that, we have the second significant unit in the project here, the Delta-Mendota Canal which runs from the Delta where it hooks on to the Sacramento River, comes to the pumping plant of Tracy and is then raised and closed by gravity down here to a place called Mendota Pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.128" offset="1191894">There it is released and flows back up north again and water these lands, which previously received water of the San Joaquin River.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.332" offset="1356675">We will try to get it reproduced and then return this along with the reproduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.021" offset="1379453">You will notice of course that since the Delta-Mendota Canal comes only to Mendota pool, this would mean that if Friant Dam were closed completely, this area on which I've marked with red running from Friant Dam down to Mendota Pool would be without water and that is the area that we're concerned with in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.942" offset="1515186">The diversion of the natural flow at the San Joaquin having made no provision from those lands in the red area, gave rise to a problem that the Reclamation Bureau and the United States of course have to face.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.541" offset="1601494">Some of the water rights in that area, indeed, most of the water rights in that area were required under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.784" offset="1634513">We entered into contracts either buying the rights or contracts to supply them with water or agreed a partial arrangement to supply some water and to make some payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.848" offset="1682787">A minority of the land owners and the United States were unable to grip -- to agree and this suit resulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.114" offset="1719777">The water rights asserted by the plaintiffs were of three kinds, some of the plaintiffs whose land actually along the river claimed riparian rights which California still recognizes to a degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.310" offset="1784560">The United States has always acknowledged some interference with those riparian rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.467" offset="1817266">It claims to have taken them to the extent that there is interference and it denies the full amount of the interference that the plaintiffs claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.414" offset="1861047">Some of the plaintiffs claim what are known as overlying rights to the underground waters which they claim were fed by the San Joaquin River.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.934" offset="1899081">They were mostly in this area, south of the river, barely reaching to the City of Fresno.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.253" offset="1936384">The United States, for the most part, denies that it has interfered with the overlying rights to the extent that they have been impaired, again, we claim to have taken it.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.875" offset="1994898">Some of the plaintiffs -- I might -- I should say too that the City of Fresno has been spoken off for the most part as being in the category of the owner of overlying rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.865" offset="2046830">Finally, some of the plaintiffs claim appropriative rights that is to say they are not neither overlying land owners nor riparian but they claim to have taken water and put it to beneficial use in time to have acquired rights under California water law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="525.913" offset="2207013">Oh yes, subject to only one -- subject to one possible qualification and I don't -- we don't have enough facts to say how much the qualification it is, but some of them may now be barred by the statute of limitation, although most of them have already brought their suits and were not barred by the statute, but I wouldn't want to say that there was nobody who might be barred by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.265" offset="2304397">But we acknowledge to the extent we'd interfered that there clearly -- we were clearly bound to recognize the rights under state law to that extent, if we have to take them, we couldn't just wipe them out, and that that gave rise to an obligation to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.841" offset="2362702">So the real issue here isn't one of the obligation to pay, it's to whether they can tie up the project as a way of asserting their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.094" offset="2399796">The action was brought against officials of the Reclamation Bureau to seek what is called a physical solution of the plaintiff's originally riparian rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.210" offset="2452250">Under California law, a riparian or overlying owner who can show that other people on the stream are interfering with the natural flow of the water, may obtain a decree restraining interference with the flow of the stream unless the junior appropriator at his own expense make some physical arrangements which will protect the superior right of the riparian owner to water to a reasonable extent.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.938" offset="2583176">For example in the present case, which is as good as an example of a physical solution as any, the District Court enjoined the operation of Friant Dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.179" offset="2620061">They said you can't use Friant Dam and required the Reclamation Bureau to release all the waters of the San Joaquin River unless the United States build a series of 10 more dams and operated them in the manner that the District Court required, describing the dams in great detail even down to gantry trains and the size of rails of the train should run on and so forth, and it provided that there should be a specified flow of water over the last dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.197" offset="2760182">The individual defendants when the suit started, moved to dismiss upon various grounds, but especially on the ground that the action was in reality, one against the United States barred under the doctrine of the Larson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.139" offset="2823920">When that motion was denied, the officials made a number of answers, including answers on the merits but they preserve the position which we insist upon here at all times that this was an unconsented to suit against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.701" offset="2894137">The District Court found against the reclamation official, both on the question of jurisdiction and on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.049" offset="2927574">It entered a decree which as I have said, enjoined the operation of Friant Dam, enjoined the transfer of water through the Madera and Friant-Kern Canals unless the United States which it recognized would have to go in, chose to build 10 additional dams on the strip of the river down the Gravelly Ford at an expense of somewhere around a million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.415" offset="3053066">I must now I think for the purposes of clarification, turn to a second aspect of the case in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.418" offset="3093086">The City of Fresno was one of the plaintiffs in the original action seeking protection of what Fresno said were her overlying rights to the underground waters alleged by her but denied by us as coming from the San Joaquin.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.418" offset="3173021">At this stage when Fresno came in, the United States was joined as a defendant or at least attempted to be joined because the United States never appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.002" offset="3215339">In addition, Fresno filed a separate complaint and intervention against both the Reclamation Bureau officials and the United States seeking a declaratory judgment that her right to take additional water from the San Joaquin River from the natural flow was superior to any rights of the United States to the waters of the San Joaquin because we had acquired assignments of rights to the waters of the San Joaquin from the State of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.446" offset="3349191">Third, Fresno sought a declaratory judgment that the United States was obliged to furnish Fresno with water from Millerton Lake behind Friant Dam at the price of 350 an acre foot, although the price charged to all other municipalities for water under the Central Valley project is higher and ranges up but not above $10 of acre foot.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.715" offset="3458278">The District Court gave judgment against the Untied States on both these claims for a declaratory judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.897" offset="3490983">The Court of Appeals reversed, as to the United States, holding that there was an unconsented suit against the United States and the City of Fresno by the petition in Number 51, the second case to be argued today, brought that ruling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.954" offset="3579173">With respect to the original suit, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in favor of the riparian overlying owners so far as the individual defendants were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.929" offset="3647091">It held it was not an action -- really an action against the United States because it fell within the exception which permits its said suits against officers of the United States where they are acting outside of the scope of their authority and committing a tort against the plaintiffs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2687.738" offset="10854275">The Federal Act, the 1937 Act puts domestic use and irrigation use on an equal footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.838" offset="10910699">The Act of 1939 contains a provision which I do not think is material in this case for the reason that as the California Water Rights Board found, the districts are getting so much water, they're about to become water logged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.777" offset="10998471">Now that was the decision of the California Water Rights Board which has never shown any particular friendship for Fresno, but that Act says, the 1939 Act says that the Secretary may not give water to a city if it would injure the irrigation features of the project.</text>

            <text syncTime="2879.302" offset="11620603">Now, we claim that if there is a shortage of water that -- that Section 9 (c) is unconstitutional, we ask this Court as they did in the reapportionment cases, the farmers controlled all the legislatures.</text>

            <text syncTime="3170.694" offset="12786186">If you will read the answers of the various defendants, practically all of them ask that the District Court make a physical solution.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="5165.052" offset="20763564">Mr. Justice Black, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5168.958" offset="20779238">I think it might be most helpful if I spent my time treating these cases as run together dealing with three topics.</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.832" offset="20830751">First, it might be helpful to describe again, exactly what was the judgment that Fresno got in the District Court which is before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5192.595" offset="20873801">Second, I want to deal with an argument which Mr. Rowe makes in his brief and which impressed Judge Peirson Hall in the District Court although it was rejected by the Circuit Court to which that we had consented.</text>
            <text syncTime="5205.723" offset="20926255">And third, I would like to deal with the county of origin and watershed statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5213.352" offset="20956766">Now Fresno obtained under the District Court judgment, three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="5220.626" offset="20985919">First is an allegedly overlying owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.992" offset="20999293">It obtained an injunction against the Reclamation Bureau of Fisheries and the United States enjoining the operation of Friant Dam as a great work, carrying water north and south.</text>
            <text syncTime="5240.203" offset="21064182">As to that issue, the United States was dismissed in the Court of Appeals, that is to say the judgment was reversed as to us and the question would be whether we consented and whether the action against the individual defendants can be maintained and I dealt pretty much with the second of those points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5261.849" offset="21150804">The second thing that Fresno got was a declaratory judgment really against the United States and only the United States in this respect to the effect that its right to make future appropriations of water from the prime -- from the San Joaquin River.</text>
            <text syncTime="5288.119" offset="21255816">This isn't its right as an overlying -- this is making appropriations out of the river, was superior to any water rights the United States might get in the river and that seems to me clearly and indisputably to be a judgment against the United States and only the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.758" offset="21330422">The third thing that Fresno got is a declaration and I guess an injunction saying that Fresno was entitled to water -- it was entitled not to have the natural flow of the stream interfered with unless she got water from the project at 350 and in effect, that seems to me to be a declaration that the United States or somebody must furnish affirmatively property of the United States at this price and I really see no escape from the proposition that that is a judgment against the United States and clearly wants to be dismissed unless we have consented.</text>
            <text syncTime="5356.915" offset="21531042">Now there is at this stage, really no dispute about Fresno getting water.</text>
            <text syncTime="5366.090" offset="21567718">Her contract for water from the project covers all the water that Fresno can possibly use within the intermediate to run future.</text>
            <text syncTime="5380.205" offset="21624142">There is a testimony that Fresno might someday have uses in demands in excess of this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5387.645" offset="21653922">But for the present, as soon as she builds the necessary work, she will get all the water she can use for some time.</text>

            <text syncTime="5554.071" offset="22319626">I do mean to deal with it, but I think that it would be better to deal with it a little more length than trying to deal with it halfway now.</text>
            <text syncTime="5561.872" offset="22350869">Since the one common question probably to all three suits is whether the United States has consented to be sued, I want to deal with that first and then I will come to the county of origin and watershed legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5577.395" offset="22412936">Judge Hall said that we had consented to be sued because of the statute that appears on pages 2 and 3 of our brief in Number 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="5589.414" offset="22461001">That's the City of Fresno case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5594.327" offset="22480645">You'll note that it provides the consent is hereby given to join the United States as a defendant in any suit for the adjudication of rights to the use of water of a river system or other source or for the administration of such right, where it appears the United States is the owner of or is in the process of acquiring water rights by appropriation under state law and the United States as a necessary party to such suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5626.014" offset="22607391">It is our view that that statute has no application because it applies only to a particular class of litigation to the well-known suit in western water law for the general adjudication of all rights in a river system that it does not apply as a reverse to suits by some owners on the stream against the United States to enjoin the United States from interfering with their water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="5661.728" offset="22750333">I rely really on three lines of argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.312" offset="22768619">The first deals with words.</text>
            <text syncTime="5669.854" offset="22782830">You will note that the statute does not give permission to sue the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.074" offset="22803623">It gives permission to join the United States as a defendant and thus implying that there will be other real defendants whose interests are diverse to the United States imply normally other private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5689.156" offset="22860048">This certainly is consistent with the notion of this being a special kind of well known suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="5695.203" offset="22884185">Second, it speaks of a suit for the adjudication of rights to the use of water -- of a river system or other source.</text>
            <text syncTime="5703.076" offset="22915636">It's not all suits dealing with the interference of right -- with water rights or alleged trespassory conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5710.255" offset="22944371">It's suits for the adjudication of rights and we think it means all rights to the use of water from a river system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5718.169" offset="22976031">And then finally over on the top of page 3, it again speaks of a case in which the United States is a necessary party and we think this confirms our reading because of the obvious fairness of not having when the United States has acquired a great many water rights on western streams, of not having the whole class of suits for the general adjudication of rights preceded by the fact that you can't join the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="5749.307" offset="23100583">So the statute says, where you have a suit like that, the United States is a necessary party then you can join them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5757.939" offset="23135169">In addition to the words, we rely very strongly on the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5766.210" offset="23168188">In this course of the Senate report describing this bill, the report quotes at some length from the decision of this Court in Pacific Live Stock Company against Oregon Water Board and the passage that it quotes is describing the kind of suit that the statute deals with is described in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="5790.269" offset="23264423">All claimants are required to appear and prove their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="5794.775" offset="23282500">No one could refuse without forfeiting his claim and all have the same relation to the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="5800.628" offset="23305906">It is intended to be universal and to result in a complete ascertainment of all existing rights to the end first that the water maybe distributed among all lawful claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5811.936" offset="23351150">Second, that the rights of all maybe evidenced by appropriate certificates and third that the amount of surplus or unclaimed water maybe made available to appropriate it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5883.579" offset="23637661">Such action of the part of the appropriators might be taken on their own initiative or might be stimulated by third parties who are opposing this development.</text>
            <text syncTime="5891.612" offset="23669844">And then he went on and said if that isn't the purpose, we ought to make this clear in the committee report or some similar way by legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5899.507" offset="23701400">Senator McCarran wrote back S-18, speaking the bill that became the law that I was dealing with, is not intended to be used for the purpose of obstructing the project to which you speak or any similar project and it is not intended to be used for any other purpose then to allow the United States to be joined where in it is necessary to adjudicate all the rights of various owners on a given stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="5927.813" offset="23814666">This is so because unless all the parties owning on process of acquiring water rights on a particular stream can be joined as party defendants and a subsequent decree would be of little value which fits right in with the words I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="5941.640" offset="23869942">I agree with you that for the purposes of legislative history the report should show that S-18 is not intended to be used for the purpose of obstructing or delaying Bureau of Reclamation project for the good of the public and water users by the method of which you speak and I'm translating that into legal terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="5959.548" offset="23941517">I would think that it finally was not intended to be used for the purpose of a suit to manage the way the project is carried on as it's happening here or as to prevent it from being built as to what have happened if we have brought this -- the action had been brought a little earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="5977.311" offset="24012570">Third, I would point out that both the Fifth and in a case prior to this one, the Ninth Circuit have interpreted the statute in a way that we contend that it should be interpreted and the Ninth Circuit particularly of course is one familiar with water law and with this kind of problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="5999.079" offset="24099715">The case to which I refer in the Ninth Circuit unfortunately is not in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="6023.507" offset="24197413">Now we have set forth in our brief the respects in which this case fails to be a suit for the general adjudication of water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6036.261" offset="24248404">There are a number of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6037.625" offset="24253837">Without taking time, I'll simply going to refer to one and that is that it is perfectly claimed that this decree does not adjudicate any rights as between the various water owners -- well, various water rights owners on the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="6056.213" offset="24328234">It simply adjudicates what are alleged to be rights against the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="6069.156" offset="24379956">It said that for the reasons mentioned in our brief that this was not a suit for the general adjudication of water right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6076.717" offset="24410258">The most important of those reasons is that Judge Hall in the District Court himself said and I quote from his opinion, “This is not a suit wherein plaintiff seeks to establish for each of them their separate rights [Inaudible] to a given quantity of water as between themselves or as against one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="6097.457" offset="24493223">And again, this is not -- this suit is not a case where water users either riparian or overlying are seeking to enforce any separate or several rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="6107.454" offset="24533138">In the findings and conclusions, the judge said, it is not the intention of the Court to attempt to divide the waters of the San Joaquin River between the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="6118.364" offset="24576815">This was plainly a suit against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="6120.522" offset="24585488">It wasn't for a general declaration of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6123.552" offset="24597608">Now, there is only one other thing I need to add on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6128.628" offset="24617880">Even if there could be doubt as to whether this statute gives consent to the kind of suit seeking a physical solution which I don't think there's anybody, even if it could, it certainly doesn't give consent to a suit seeking a declaration of the price that the Secretary shall charge for a project water and it certainly doesn't constitute consent to a declaratory judgment as between the United States and Fresno just the two of them as to future rights through appropriation in the natural flow of the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="6165.785" offset="24766464">So that we think that the Ninth Circuit was quite plainly correct on this point in ruling in favor of the United States that it had given no consent to be sued.</text>

            <text syncTime="6177.380" offset="24812857">Suppose that the charge if there was, this case was brought based on the fact that the Secretary has somehow arbitrarily taken a surprise that the statute absolutely prevail.</text>

            <text syncTime="6207.534" offset="24933543">There are decisions which would seem to sustain -- Swigart and Baker was a case of that kind Justice Black, the one referred to by Mr. Rowe.</text>
            <text syncTime="6217.722" offset="24974294">There it was claimed that the Secretary had wrongly included the cost of maintenance in calculating the rates that were to be charged for irrigation of water because the maintenance budget and he threatened to cut off the water as I recall it unless the owners pay them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6241.447" offset="25069171">The suit was allowed to proceed to enjoin the cutting off of the water on the ground that it was a wrongful interference with the irrigators' rights because of the unauthorized act of the Secretary to which that he had not computed according to the statutory formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="6264.493" offset="25161331">But note that it was -- he had done something, he was alleged to be doing something outside of his authority whereas here -- and the suit wasn't against the United States, whereas here, the judgment is sought against the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="6279.363" offset="25220786">It is sought in advance to bind the Secretary as to what he shall do and it doesn't run against anybody threatening to cut off Fresno's water from the project because Fresno hasn't built the system and equipment, it can't take any water from the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="6296.820" offset="25290689">So that what I'm saying is that if sometime in the future when Fresno were taking water, the Secretary should determine a rate which it was alleged that he had no authority under the statute to determine then I would think that there was at least an argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6315.262" offset="25364459">Certainly, they would be under Swigart and Baker that the action could be maintained.</text>
