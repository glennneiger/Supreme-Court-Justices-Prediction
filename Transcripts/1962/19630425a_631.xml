            <text syncTime="26.838" offset="210735">Mr. Chief Justice, Honorable Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.098" offset="227767">As you know in this situation, may it please the Court, this particular case has been the subject of two District Court opinions, three opinions of the Court of Appeals and one prior opinion of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.559" offset="293595">The case is entirely one involving the scope and extent as well as the interpretation of the so-called Jencks statute, which is 18 United States Code, Section 3500.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.211" offset="352214">Now, the facts of this case will work into the law as it is discussed by myself and my colleague, Mr. O'Donnell, but I wish to begin by showing the diverse positions in this case and arguing the -- of course, the position of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.588" offset="421700">In the first instance, we have the Palermo decision which was followed by the first Campbell case in which this Court stated that to that extent, meaning the extent as limited by the Jencks statute, and I shall refer to it as the Jencks statute, to that extent as the legislative history makes clear that Jencks Act reaffirms our holding in Jencks versus United States that the defendant on trial in a federal criminal prosecution is entitled for impeachment purposes to relevant and competent statements of a Government witness in possession of the Government touching the events or activities as to which the defend -- the witness has testified at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.922" offset="583032">Then it goes on to say that the command of the statute is thus designed to further the fair and just administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.632" offset="613857">Now, that is followed by Judge Wyzanski in the Federal District Court stating, “With reference this second remand going back to the United States Court of Appeals that that Court has still seized of the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.807" offset="674565">Its judges are as mindful as I that at the root of this case is not a mere school master's problem of construing the ambiguous language of a legislature, but the protection of the fundamental right of any defendant in a criminal case to impeach a witness by a substantially verbatim statement he previously made and which he has adopted and approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.894" offset="758993">Seldom indeed is there such a clear showing as there has been in this case -- as there has been here that Exhibit 3 as a witness' substantially verbatim statement made on the day after his crime, Exhibit 3 of course being the FBI agent's report, the so-called agent summary.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.627" offset="933909">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.733" offset="942268">This was followed by Judge Aldrich in the Court of Appeals stating that, if for any reason that with impeachment material does exist, a defendant is entitle to have the benefit of it, but this is in a sense a windfall rather than the performance of a duty owed.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.265" offset="1016456">The word windfall may sound alarming but either there is a duty owed or there is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.221" offset="1036204">We do not find in the statute any such duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.539" offset="1053550">This is followed by the statement of the United States Government in its briefs on page 49 that petitioners are incorrect in assuming that 18 U.S.C. 3500 creates a right of discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.309" offset="1112586">Now, the word create may be an ambiguous word here.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.211" offset="1128260">I'm not sure whether that means that the petitioners or a defendant on trial in a criminal case has no right of discovery or whether the statute does not create it.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.922" offset="1167026">Perhaps, the statute itself does not create it.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.045" offset="1175594">It would appear that the right was created prior to the statute, of course, and the statute in the petitioners' position was to limit the extent of it and not to create it of itself for the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.971" offset="1223241">Of course, the Jencks case itself which caused the statute to be enacted was not new nor was such in it, it was very obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.080" offset="1255737">This is followed by the petitioner's position as set out in its brief in the summary of argument that the approach to be submitted by the petitioners to the overall question of discovery in a criminal case under 18 U.S.C. 3500 is that within the statute, another words, so -- within the limitations set by it such as the prior appearance on direct examination of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.817" offset="1358660">A defendant on trial has a right to discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.077" offset="1371721">I don't speak of the creation of a right but has a right to discovery perhaps even a constitutional right since the statute to the extent that it goes reaffirms the holding of this Court in the Jencks case.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.838" offset="1422712">Therefore, it is submitted that discovery is to be had fairly liberally within the framework of and under the limitations set by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.160" offset="1463986">And the petitioners further stated that where there is a right, there must be a corresponding obligation or at least some form of remedy for the possessor to enforce his right or to seek redress for the violation or denial of his right.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.875" offset="1522918">Now, in that respect, we come to the important question that this Court listed in the first Campbell opinion which was the interpretation of subsection (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="366.400" offset="1568998">Now, subsection (d) which provides for the striking of a Government witness' testimony from the record, and of course, this would not be merely accumulated, but perhaps in the situation where the witness has applied an essential element in the statutory crime, a defendant would be entitled to a verdict on the striking of such a testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.842" offset="1662725">This was a law enacted by the Congress for the protection of the Government and it is undoubtedly so that it was done at the behest of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.012" offset="1695431">Now, this particular sanction seems severe, it is one that the Congress' interest in the protection of the Government and the installation of the Government witness' statements, I refer to the FBI because this is the agency or bureau involved in our particular case, interested in the protection of these FBI files.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.770" offset="1786441">If the remedy seems severe, it is one that the Congress provided them, and one which we must live with if we want to have the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.725" offset="1822281">Now, of course, I have proposed in my -- in the petitioners' brief that there is an alternative to the sanction of striking the witness' testimony because it was very obvious during oral argument in the first appearance before this Court that the question of bad faith and good faith was going to arise as to the destruction of the notes and certainly, it has in the cases on Jencks law that has followed in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.107" offset="1931786">Now, it is almost impossible speaking realistically to show bad faith on the part of an FBI agent in this destruction of the notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.938" offset="1967104">I'm not saying that it can or cannot happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.213" offset="1976195">I'm just saying as I said last time, it is impossible to know and I think that as practical people, we can assume that it will be just about an impossibility to have a proof of such a showing of bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.741" offset="2030320">On the other hand, if we set up the objectives or the object of standard versus the subject of standard, we can come to a situation which would be fairer to a defendant and I have proposed the word, the phrase secondary evidence and come to the agents' Interview Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.927" offset="2123107">Now, the Government's --</text>

            <text syncTime="594.563" offset="2481612">Well, I should like then to start under Section (e) (1), the production of the statement under the adopted or approval portion of Section (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="610.406" offset="2545037">Under that Section, the Court stated of course that this could be a statement taken by a third party or written by a third party and that if it was adopted or approved, there would not need a signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.783" offset="2590490">I think that law is already been established, but in this instance, we submit that we have shown through the testimony of both Agent Toomey and of Mr. Staula himself that these were adopted or approved certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.206" offset="2664155">The Government takes the position that it must have specific approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.711" offset="2686203">Now, I'm not sure how broad or narrow the scope of the phrase specific approval is, but if that phrase means that it can only be an approval of the exactly the very words that the agent was given by the witness, this, of course, is not necessarily encompassed by subsection (1) of the Section (e), for the reason that I've used the phrase in the brief and I repeat it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.645" offset="2805948">It was stated by a member of this Court last time, it doesn't matter what his notes are even if they'd be hieroglyphics so long as the -- they are read back and approved by the witness appearing before the FBI agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.646" offset="2849938">Now, in that context, the agent wrote down the notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.430" offset="2873135">This is undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.378" offset="2876897">He took notes while the witness spoke to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.930" offset="2887137">He also went over the notes, the FBI agent at various times said, “No, I didn't go over the notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.094" offset="2911796">I went over the story,” but this is a conclusion which was given by the agent when he could put it across which was self-serving in nature but when asked specifically, “What did you read back to him, how did you do it, what did you say” and we got to the actual factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.013" offset="2983476">It was very obvious that this man read back his notes just as any men who take notes would do it, whether he'd be an insurance adjustor or an FBI agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.547" offset="3021511">The job is to make sure that the notes are taken correctly and accurately.</text>

            <text syncTime="1630.391" offset="6624946">The finding supported by the record is that that Interview Report so captioned by the FBI Agent, John Toomey is producible in behalf of the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.334" offset="6672697">It wasn't produced and therefore I say that petitioners are entitled to a reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.992" offset="6695372">Now, may it please the Court, insofar as the proposition is concerned, the record stands in the findings of Judge Wyzanski that evidence supported his conclusions, but I say this, considering the Government's brief, we have this type of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.112" offset="6787845">I say it's an -- indisputable that the Jencks Act merely reaffirms the Jencks' decision and that this proposition and -- at the trial level of the case to ask a Government witness or any witness whether or not they've made a prior statement and -- to lay a foundation for it is something that is common place in the law and has been part of the law for many, many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.243" offset="6908322">So in analogy, what we have here is a principle of law that's been followed by the Court for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.474" offset="6941236">All we have is our old friendly principle dressed in formal clothes and he has a congressional past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.437" offset="6973106">However, insofar as this -- application of this law that the trial level is concerned, I see now after having the opportunity of examining Agent Toomey on two occasions and originally examining Dominic Staula, it reminds me as a person that tries cases that stereotype is coming in to the defense of producing these documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.250" offset="7096404">And by that, I mean this, we know when not to belabor this august Court with the proposition like trial of a drunk driving case but we know there's some ritualistic stereotype statements that's constantly coming from the witness stand such as glassy eyes, thick speech, he staggered, we hear that all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.149" offset="7183966">Now, there's been introduced some new slogans.</text>

            <text syncTime="1782.842" offset="7234748">And I say that the Government's brief is covered with the slogans and ritualistic statements of jottings of the agent, investigative notes, summary, not verbatim, not substantially verbatim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1828.787" offset="7418546">And in support of the record and the conclusions as found by Judge Wyzanski, I think it does violence to reason for anyone who think as it show the record that this FBI agent of 16 years experience and the records supports that he's out interviewing a -- an eyewitness to a bank robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.833" offset="7502660">The whole atmosphere of the interview is private.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.608" offset="7517811">He's with him in a police station and he's sitting down taking it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1858.582" offset="7537664">And therefore, the record supports that he took the observations of Dominic Staula and asked him what he observed in the bank and he was told that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.683" offset="7586147">So, with that in mind, when we come to the various provisions of the 3500 in the trial of cases when one is attempting with his responsibility to impeach a witness, we come up against the test of verbatim, a defendant has a test of substantially verbatim, I say that there was an attempt in Congress to have it verbatim but that yielded to something less than verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.541" offset="7733582">So what would happen?</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.960" offset="7739225">We have experiences in the trial of cases of what legal tests are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.195" offset="7764198">In -- on the civil side of the Court, a person can lose a fortune on the legal test of fair preponderance of evidence and on the criminal side of the Court, the Government has a burden of proving as a legal test that we're familiar with beyond a reasonable doubt to the modal of certainty every element of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.437" offset="7857089">Now, there's a test shifted over to a defendant concerning the wall of evidence as we read the Circuit's opinion of something that we have to get the exactness of some science that just wouldn't be in keeping with the science of jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.973" offset="7955310">So in this regard, we can't overlook propositions that when you do find yourself confronted with looking for report, I say, and I say respectfully that there seems to be in the courtroom that people reason what their glean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.580" offset="8057710">If the phrase FBI is mentioned, suddenly right on the remand of this case, we heard such phrases as we were examining an FBI agent that I've -- not while this country is having a rendezvous with destiny, I've got too many grandchildren, you're not going to put this flag in half mast and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.297" offset="8152586">This is the -- and what we're looking for is something that's not a vast secret in the Department of Justice but something that involves a person outside the Department of Justice that's already testified for the Government and we're merely looking to examine them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.613" offset="8225834">And I go further it seems as though -- and it's obvious that when we think of that department of the Government then they naturally hold out that law enforcement serves a high purpose and that the big brother to law enforcement throughout the nation that you now can say that their agent with 16 years experience had any motive for taking a bad report, wasn't capable of taking an accurate report which the record supports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.369" offset="8360835">And I further say this that when we're dealing with this Bureau, I know that they have a lot of prestige when they're on the witness stand and I say that the year books of the Encyclopedia Britannica indicate to us that their success in Court averages something around 94% or 95% or 96% guilties and the vast number of that on pleas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.398" offset="8488939">So when a trial of a case, I say that Congress never intended to set up a congressional blockade so that someday the reports might contain 100% convictions of all the matters treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.251" offset="8560410">So, may it please the Court, I feel that what we have here to decide on the already existing record is not the slogans, not the stereotype, ritualistic statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.640" offset="8633971">It's not in the Government brief but in the record that it will show Mr. Toomey stated them as Mr. Staula that they had a conference and that an accurate and reasonable report that is producible was had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.941" offset="8707114">So I respect --</text>

            <text syncTime="2273.088" offset="9195708">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.452" offset="9233220">I think it may be helpful in the beginning to recall very briefly the sequence of events in this case also perhaps most of the Court has it in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.073" offset="9283688">The robbery occurred back in 1957 and of course, these interviews with the witness were conducted before the Jencks Act had been passed and just after the Jencks decision had been handed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2314.233" offset="9360280">The trial was held as there as I can make out from the record some time in the Spring of 1958, that's five years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.580" offset="9409703">Then the case -- there was a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.489" offset="9421302">The case came up to this Court on certiorari from the affirmance of the conviction and it was held that there had been an error in the procedure or perhaps I should say in the substance, in any event an error with respect to the handling of the Jencks Act question, both because the Judge failed to call Agent Toomey to find out whether the writing that Staula referred to had ever been adopted and approved by Staula because he hadn't perhaps inquired sufficiently into what had happened to the writing as it was described by Staula, and because the judge had more of an affirmative duty to inquire into the existence of valid impeaching material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.102" offset="9631744">The case then went back and there was a hearing before Judge McCarthy upon the questions that this Court had formulated in the course of its opinion and Judge McCarthy heard Toomey, the FBI agent who'd taken the -- made the report at some length.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.648" offset="9717948">And that the conclusion of that hearing, Judge McCarthy made very clear findings of fact in which he found that this was not a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by Staula to Toomey, and he found that the notes had not been adopted or approved by Staula.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.401" offset="9829021">Then the case went to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals did two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.452" offset="9865174">First it said that reviewing the records for itself, because he thought that Judge McCarthy had a committed view on this, that if found, as a fact, that this was not a qualified statement under (e) (2), that it was not a substantially verbatim recital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.201" offset="9944168">And it sent the matter back to a new judge who by lot became Judge Wyzanski to determine a single question and that was because Staula, who haven't been called and to have him testify and Toomey testified again upon the single question of whether Staula had adopted and approved the notes as his statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.146" offset="10031940">Judge Wyzanski, then took testimony and instead of confining himself to the question that the Court of Appeals have put before him, he went out of his way and on the basis of the evidence before him and apparently disregarding all the evidence before Judge McCarthy which had been submitted when that issue was the one in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2634.696" offset="10642160">I take it if the record would permit only one finding that that would be entirely a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.144" offset="10663999">If there could be no difference based on what a reasonable man might find based on the witnesses and so forth then it was proper to go ahead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.458" offset="10705168">Now, I was relating this not to argue that Judge Wyzanski's views under (e) (2) were irrelevant because I don't think I'm entitled to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.510" offset="10749367">I think he did go outside its structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.354" offset="10760756">I am relating it because I do think that -- well, barely several things, I think that the whole record is before this Court, both the testimony taken before Judge McCarthy and the testimony taken before Judge Wyzanski.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.231" offset="10840273">I think that the -- that second -- that interpreted -- that in interpreting Judge Wyzanski's finding and in resolving the contradictions between them, there is no escape from going back to the facts and I think third, that if Judge Wyzanski's findings, which of course like all findings are open to some interpretation, are interpreted in one way, if -- when he finds that the two accounts given by the agent were in ipsissima verba, he really means that they were in ipsissima verba then we respectfully submit that his findings are clearly contrary to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.642" offset="11021981">So that I do say no escape from a considerable consideration of the evidence at both hearings and it was really that point as well as recalling when it happened that I was attempting to lead up to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.710" offset="11090213">The actual issue in this case is very narrowly confined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.575" offset="11125635">The Government's duty with respect to statements is laid down in the Jencks Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.282" offset="11152488">The only contention that has been made here is that the testament was producible under the Jencks Act and we have as a starting point in this case the interpretation could have found the Jencks Act by this Court, in the Palermo case where the Court held that although (e) (2) particularly does go beyond, somewhat beyond mechanical or stenographic statement still thereafter the statute is to be construed most narrowly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.182" offset="11288116">And the Court attempting to indicate of what it thought was the proper formulas in, it is clear that Congress was concerned that only those statements which could properly be called the witness' own words should be made available to defense for -- purposes of impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.137" offset="11363871">Summaries of an oral statement which evidence -- substantial selection of material or which were prepared after the interview without the aid of complete notes and hence rest upon the memory of the agent are not to be produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.047" offset="11423535">Now, our argument is that, under the Palermo case, under the words of the statute and under the sense of fairness of the problem which I'm going to try to attempt to develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.782" offset="11474526">Neither, the Interview Report by which I mean, the same as you Mr. Justice Brennan, the agent's signed report, nor what I shall call them notes, the thing he wrote down during the interview is producible under the Jencks Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.196" offset="11548191">I do think also, it's not in the record, that it maybe helpful before I come to those to say just a word about the general practice as I understand it, of the FBI in taking these interviews.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.787" offset="11622484">And I will try to distinguish between today as a result of the Jencks Act and the Jencks decision in our experience and what was done earlier, also really there's very little difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.278" offset="11672534">An agent maybe sent out or maybe sent out and may choose to do either of two things, if he thinks a man is what is called a key witness, one who can give a substantial account of whatever it is he's investigating then he is told to get a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.593" offset="11753723">And by a statement, he means the witness' own words as to what occurred or preferably signed although as we all know, you can't always get a man to sign something even though you will say it was his statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.820" offset="11814640">If he does not think the man is unimportant or if you can't get him for one reason or another to make a statement, then he is instructed to prepare a written report that is a complete and accurate account of the information that he got from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.507" offset="11893426">The first is the witness' statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.096" offset="11903770">By statement, they mean, I think something like Justice Goldberg was suggesting earlier or something the witness, I said or that something the witness -- in his words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.357" offset="11952776">On the other hand, the report involves selectivity of the agent's judgment of what was the important information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.856" offset="11990810">Now, all statements have always been kept and this of course has always been kept by the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.113" offset="12039816">In the -- today, and this was simply because they were supposed to be important and people knew that they might be used in Court either for the Government or against the Government and for that reason, they were preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.743" offset="12102301">Today, they are preserved, of course, because of the Jencks Act and because we now know that's there's an obligation to have them and to turn them over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.457" offset="12153187">In addition as I understand it, it's not relevant I think to this case because Your Honors may have the whole picture, as I understand it, the instructions today are also to keep anything that the agent regards as a substantially verbatim recital even though it isn't a statement in the technical sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.520" offset="12237406">Now, I'm not -- I want to make it clear, I'm not suggesting that that statement of mine is relevant in judging what the agent did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.122" offset="12263842">There were no so such instructions back in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.122" offset="12287875">The agent's notes are taken and his instructions apparently are, don't try to write the whole thing, write down enough to remember and then you go back and you make a narrative report, which is an accurate statement of the information you've got and which does involve memory, selectivity, emphasis and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.296" offset="12388603">At that stage, the practice has always been to allow the agent and possibly even to encourage the agent to throw away the notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.510" offset="12433429">I inquired why are the notes thrown away?</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.736" offset="12446281">Why don't we keep them?</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.475" offset="12453282">And the answer I got was, “Well, they've served the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.273" offset="12468433">It's just as if you call me up and asked me to get you certain things to prepare your argument but once I've come and seen you, then I throw the notes away.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.170" offset="12508035">They are made for the purpose of preparing this report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.304" offset="12524544">And there's nothing as one of the FBI agent said to me, “If the Court says, “We have to keep them, we'll keep them.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.801" offset="12554533">But there didn't seem to be any purpose of it up to this point and that is what happened in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.989" offset="12599359">The notes were destroyed as the agent testified when they had served its particular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.367" offset="12636871">Now I come specifically to the statute and to the particular issues here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.752" offset="12674382">And I'm going to talk first about the Interview Report because the Interview Report is available, was available at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.093" offset="12715760">The essential facts I have already indicated, there was this interview and the agent somewhere from six to seven to nine hours later went back and dictated this report using his notes for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.106" offset="12787754">It seems to us plain, first from the words of the statute that the Interview Report does not qualify for a production.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.561" offset="12833625">Certainly, it does not qualify under Section -- subdivision (e) (1), the statutes on pages 2 and 3 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.870" offset="12870823">It is not the writing of the Interview Report, plainly was never adopted or approved by the witness and certainly, it wasn't signed by the witness.</text>

            <text syncTime="3526.223" offset="14208293">As a matter of fact, today, some of the immediate reaction to the Jencks decision had calmed down.</text>

            <text syncTime="3549.552" offset="14301602">I'm not sure that if I've been there, I wouldn't have turned it over here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.182" offset="14312051">I think there were very good reasons not to that I am going to develop but maybe there are on the side of doing it to avoid this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.454" offset="14341204">I don't mean to imply it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3618.741" offset="14578291">We do say that Judge Wyzanski's findings, if interpreted most strongly against it, simply are not supported by the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.151" offset="14616012">And we do say second, that to confine Your Honors' examination of the evidence, simply to the hearing before Judge Wyzanski, it would be unfair both to the Court of Appeals and to the Administration of Justice because we thought we've tried (e) (2) out before Judge McCarthy and we had a definitive ruling by the Court of Appeals on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="4042.068" offset="16271653">Now, that is certainly fair and proper where the difference in the order of treatment or where the omission, where the contrast and emphasis are the result of the witness' own doing, but where they result from what somebody else has done -- said Your Honor, from a defect in his memory, from his selections because of his attempt to decide what's important or whether it's simply that forgetfulness.</text>

            <text syncTime="4080.033" offset="16423476">In the second place, it seems to me that it may shake the witness' confidence in what he said, quite unfair if he's confronted with the paper that purports to say what he said, “Didn't you say this?”</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.585" offset="16485752">The FBI agent has it written down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.112" offset="16495783">Now, even so he is very sure that he didn't say it, he'll begin to wonder.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.352" offset="16516786">I think in this connection of a quite different incident, here in Court, perhaps a month or so ago when one of the Justices suggested through some aberration in his recollection that a private party couldn't sue for an injunction to restrain violations of the Sherman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="4192.283" offset="16872469">I'm not making great deal of this, but if the agent can take notes on the -- to get the information, the substance of the information and forget any danger that it will ever be used in an effort to impeach a witness later, he can carry on his job quite differently then if he has to be told.</text>
            <text syncTime="4210.982" offset="16947284">Now, remember, any report even of the substance of what the witness said to you is subject to being used to impeach him and therefore you always must take a statement of the witness what the instruction would be and this would simply be a narrowing into that degree and interference.</text>

            <text syncTime="4693.804" offset="18878568">The agent, knowing that there was three men and remember that he had interviewed other people, who might very well have said, this was apparently done over a full half hour and he was asking questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4706.575" offset="18929664">“Can you describe the third robber?”</text>

            <text syncTime="4719.503" offset="18981386">He might have replied, “I didn't get a chance to observe him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4723.291" offset="18996537">He might have said, as the Agent said he said on page 115, that he did not observe the third man standing in the back.</text>

            <text syncTime="4780.790" offset="19226520">Now to illustrate to Judge Wyzanski what he did with respect to the notes, he took the statement that's reprinted in 365 U.S., the one on page 213 of the first record that he held it in front of him as if it was his notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4796.788" offset="19290572">And then he gave what he called a narrative account such as he gave to the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4802.596" offset="19313768">And taking just the two paragraphs that they -- as they appear at page 115 of the present record, let me point out some four differences, there are others but let me point out four that seemed to me of -- perhaps not of significance in cross-examining this witness, but they show the kind of thing that it could be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="4826.187" offset="19408123">In the first place, in the statement as it was written up, it says, he did not know -- he did not know what type of gun was carried by these two individuals whom he observed but believed that they could've been 45 caliber automatics.</text>
            <text syncTime="4850.051" offset="19503626">As he put it to Judge Wyzanski, you were not certain what kind of guns they are but you feel they are 45 caliber automatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="4859.057" offset="19539571">Now, I suggest Your Honor, Justice Brennan, could do quite a lot with that on cross-examination as to the difference in the degree of the witness' recollection, which time was it right, which time was it wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.697" offset="19590144">Again, he tells it quite differently with respect to the chance to observe the robbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.260" offset="19620446">The one that is written down, the agent's report says, that after facing the wall, Staula observed these individuals no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.457" offset="19657226">I may say that the “observe” seems to me almost surely to be the agent's word.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.745" offset="19674363">It comes in over and over again and Staula didn't use it himself during his prime, the word observe, although, he answered questions with observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4903.196" offset="19716159">Now, the other time in the one of the trial, there's no such assertion at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4910.486" offset="19745311">There's no statement as to whether he had a chance to observe them further or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4915.955" offset="19767150">Another difference with respect to the opportunities and observation, in the agent's report, he has Staula saying that he entered the vault as directed and observed these individuals no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="4932.236" offset="19832351">In Court, the agent says that what he read back would have been, one of the men ordered you to go into the vault and as you got there, you saw these individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.357" offset="19876760">Now, again, let me know the qualification.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.153" offset="19887940">The next line says, you saw them no further and it maybe that the agent started to make a mistake and that the stenographer was not able to catch the intonation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4958.324" offset="19936632">But even the fact, he started to make a mistake, he got that far enough, demonstrates I think, the danger of not having something that is an attempt to recite the witness' words.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.807" offset="19986578">The final one, there's a difference with respect either to the orders that were given them about entering the vault or with respect to the time they were in the vault.</text>
            <text syncTime="4983.064" offset="20035584">In the agent's actual Interview Report down toward the end, Mr. Staula stated that one of the robbers closed the door of the vault, he issued some order to the effect that people locked inside should not leave and that they stayed there for five or ten minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5006.020" offset="20127431">The one he gave at the trial says, “Somebody closed the door of the vault and said something to the effect that people in there should not leave for five or ten minutes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5016.172" offset="20168077">There are two more -- it's the same thing but two more things.</text>

            <text syncTime="5437.451" offset="21853184">Well, I think the agent's narrative report fails under (e) (2) for several reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="5449.118" offset="21899891">In the second place, if you're -- it's not substantially verbatim, so there's no attempt to record what the witness said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5458.171" offset="21936044">And in the third place, and each of these stands as a sufficient reason, it certainly wasn't recorded contemporaneously whether it was seven hours or nine hours or something in between, I can't say but it was at least that long.</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.983" offset="22011277">Now, I said a moment ago that this was a deliberate decision by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5484.757" offset="22042415">I'm aware that the courts have been through all this in connection with Palermo, but let me just recall the fact very, very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5493.331" offset="22076688">The original bill reported by the Senate Committee made it very plain that the statute was intended (e) (2) but they weren't in that form then but the equivalent of (e) (2) was intended to be limited to recordings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5516.173" offset="22168116">And the Senate Committee report quoted some testimony by the Attorney General, making it very plain in words applicable almost to this case, that it was not intended to make producible the agent's reports of the substance of what a witness said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5536.485" offset="22249305">On the floor, the sponsors of the bill, Senator O'Mahoney and others, struck out recordings and put in records.</text>
            <text syncTime="5547.580" offset="22293713">And I think if the word record had survived, I would certainly have a much harder case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.250" offset="22312417">In fact, I doubt that I would care to argue it against the light of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.286" offset="22336554">At that stage, we know that from the debate on the floor that the Department of Justice was objecting and Senator Dirksen introduced a proposed amendment that would have gone back to recordings.</text>
            <text syncTime="5572.470" offset="22393292">And Senator Dirksen and Senator Roscoe and Senator Keekal and their statements are in our brief, all made it clear that they were supporting the amendment and objecting the Senator O'Mahoney's version because as Senator Keekal put it, witnesses should not have thrown at him records which are not agreed to be -- not agreed to be the witness' statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5595.098" offset="22483780">They didn't want it unless it was the witness' own words.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.548" offset="22497573">Now, the Senate rejected the Dirksen Amendment so that up to that stage, I -- I would have a harder if not impossible case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5608.261" offset="22536443">Over in the House, the bill was passed in a form which made it perfectly clear whether there would even be a doubt about recordings, that it took the very tight version of being espoused by the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5624.226" offset="22600286">The Conference Committee obviously rejected the Senate version.</text>
            <text syncTime="5630.816" offset="22626617">It substituted the word recording, but it did put in that it should be a substantially verbatim recital and there were some discussion in both Houses about what was meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5644.826" offset="22682728">Senator Keating said in the House, “The conference provided the only statements of defendant, provide the only statements the defendant could see and then only in the courtroom were those actually signed or formally approved by the witness or stenographic verbatim recital of a statement made by a witness which is recorded contemporaneously with the making of such oral statement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.837" offset="22770709">In the Senate, Senator Jarvis made what I think was the most authoritative statement, what has been done with the so-called record provision is to tie it down to those cases in which the agent actually purports to -- actually purports to make a substantially verbatim recital of an oral statement the witness has made to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5689.670" offset="22862033">I submit that anyone who arranged the testimony here must conclude that the witness did purport either in the Interview Report or in his notes to make a substantially verbatim recital of the witness' own words.</text>
            <text syncTime="5706.202" offset="22928175">That wasn't what they've tried to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5708.111" offset="22935803">It wasn't on the testimony what they did and I submit it for the reasons I tried to indicate before that to permit him to be cross-examined about variations between his testimony and that kind of statement in a forum where small differences can be exploited, words, his own words opt to be exploited quite properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5734.798" offset="23042591">But to subject into that where it isn't his own words where the differences may be somebody else's word, is to introduce a false issue, to distract from the attention at the trial and to really interfere and not aid in the administration of justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="5760.279" offset="23144469">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5763.940" offset="23159097">I should like to start my rebuttal by alluding to a statement made by the Solicitor General that this issue could have been avoided had he been there because he might have given us the statement and thereby avoided the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5779.066" offset="23219597">Let me say, this in the first record that appeared in the first Campbell case, the testimony of the witness Yates that was also reproduced -- was also produced and in that situation, we had an identical foundation laid for the production of a statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5795.305" offset="23284590">And as I read some of the later cases, I'm not sure that you have to lay the foundation for production of these statements, but in any event, in that instance we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5803.917" offset="23319071">The judge ordered the Yates Interview Report produced and the Government complied with it willingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5812.230" offset="23352299">We came to the Staula testimony and we asked the same series of introductory or foundation questions and the judge, if you recall from the first Campbell opinion, did order it produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="5825.026" offset="23403499">At that time, the Government very strenuously objected to it and I say that takes care of the Government's contention of guesswork up in this Court saying that, “Well, perhaps he meant by our observation this or perhaps he meant by observation that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5838.695" offset="23458147">I don't say this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5840.116" offset="23463790">The Government didn't give us the Staula statement because the defendant Lester would.</text>
            <text syncTime="5844.635" offset="23481866">The witness, Staula was the only men in 58 Government witnesses that identified the defendant Staula and had we obtained -- I'm sorry, the defendant Lester, excuse me and had we obtained that statement, you may rest assure that the likelihood of an acquittal for at least that one defendant would have been assured.</text>
            <text syncTime="5865.717" offset="23566190">And I say that is the reason we didn't get it because it contained a bomb, if I may use that expression, and that was why if there was a simple explanation, this idea of saying, don't confront a witness with something that might not be his words, can anyone say, if I were to say to the witness right now, Mr. Staula, didn't you say you did not observe a third man?</text>
            <text syncTime="5887.051" offset="23651558">Is there anything to -- is there anyone to say that he wouldn't say, I never said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5891.500" offset="23669321">Now, this isn't a nicety about the meaning of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="5894.513" offset="23681442">This is a clear cut proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="5896.382" offset="23688861">He saw a third man or he didn't see a third man and if he didn't, he could clearly say so.</text>

            <text syncTime="5941.557" offset="23869628">At the time, he was sent down to the rail and he stood before the three men who were in an enforced seating arrangement with a motion for sequestration having been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="5954.470" offset="23921246">And he stood before these three defendants and he pointed to one Campbell and then he didn't -- but didn't say anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="5961.967" offset="23951235">That doesn't appear on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5963.612" offset="23957817">But I only say this, in real life, down in that courtroom as Mr. Justice Brennan said, we shouldn't go behind the facts here, in real life, that man pointed to three defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5973.029" offset="23995538">He stated, “I know Campbell resembles one”, and he definitely identified Lester.</text>
            <text syncTime="5979.546" offset="24021556">Now, when he stated the identification of Lester about the gas station, he was actually saying, “I know Campbell in that gas station and not Lester” and the record shows that the judge rehabilitated him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5992.422" offset="24073070">In addition to which, the record will show that everyone of the Government witnesses who identified a robber at the door of the bank pointed to Alvin Campbell as being the man in the blue suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6004.361" offset="24120822">Now, he says Donald Lester was the man in the blue suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="6007.682" offset="24134092">This taken out of context and produced in a record with only his testimony doesn't show the entire picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="6013.783" offset="24158542">The entire picture shows that all three defendants were intimately wrapped up in his testimony and that the question of his putting Staula into the -- here, I go again -- Lester into that bank was through this witness and when one of the Justices said that this was a crucial witness, I should hope to tell you it was because this was the Government's case against one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="6039.057" offset="24259584">Now, I didn't mean to get excited but I think therein lies the answer to why we were given the exact situation in the Yates testimony and we were not given it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6052.136" offset="24311933">And I say this respectfully, certainly, to one of the imminence of the Solicitor General but had he been there at the trial, he might have seen a little different picture than what appears today in the cold print of the record before this Honorable body.</text>
            <text syncTime="6068.286" offset="24376508">Now, as I understand this Mr. Justice White, there's utterly no requirement of substantially verbatim under subsection (e) (1).</text>
