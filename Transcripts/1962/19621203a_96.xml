            <text syncTime="27.932" offset="215124">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.371" offset="236857">This case involves the federal tax lien which is created by Section 3670 of 1939 Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.069" offset="287640">The question is whether a subsequent local property tax lien shall be preferred over an earlier federal tax lien whether because of the existence of a mortgage to which the Federal Government grants priority or for some reason peculiar in the nature of the local property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.211" offset="380217">The facts are quite simple and they're undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.925" offset="399026">In 1946, the respondent bank, lent $2600 to one Joseph Victory.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.553" offset="433612">He took back a mortgage covering this indebtedness and that mortgage was created in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.342" offset="460779">Seven years later, in 1953, United States filed notice of a federal tax lien in the amount of some $857, and this was against Victory.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.832" offset="522742">In 1957, four years later starting from July 1, 1957, local liens or various real estate taxes owed to the City of Buffalo, real estate taxes owed to Erie County and certain sewer rents began accruing.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.322" offset="604662">In 1958, the respondent bank brought an action in the Erie County court to foreclose his mortgage which by that time had been paid down to some $1400 and for an interest of 5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.155" offset="688044">When the United States answered in this action, its originally $157 lien had been paid down to $690, and the record that gives no indication that Mr. Victory was insolvent as the Court will recall from earlier cases when it goes off on the revised statute Section 3466 that there is an indication into solvency.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.271" offset="776443">That's not present here and this case involves the federal tax lien standing alone as such.</text>

            <text syncTime="187.200" offset="852198">Let me just go through those again.</text>

            <text syncTime="188.598" offset="857736">The mortgage was given to -- in 1946, seven years later, the federal tax liens came along in 1953 and four years later, the local tax did so that not the common case where we're worrying about a minute of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.319" offset="912697">There's no question about that recording in here, everything that needed to be was recorded and there's no close interplay there.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.989" offset="935372">It's a remarkable case in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.965" offset="951254">When the mortgagee was in the Erie County court, it moved for summary judgment and the Erie County court granted this motion and said that property should be sold subject to local taxes but free and clear of the federal tax liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.877" offset="1030875">And the proceeds would then go to satisfy the mortgage debt first.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.741" offset="1046340">Now, a moment's reflection will make it clear that if the property is sold subject to the local taxes that price which a bidder is willing to pay will be reduced by the amount equal to the local taxes since there's practically no way of escaping that obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.461" offset="1113213">And at the same time, since the Federal Government must look only to the sales proceeds, its chances of recovering the federal tax lien under that form of sale are diminished.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.229" offset="1156263">And on appeal by the Government, the Appellate Division reversed on essentially the same ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.870" offset="1198895">And it's -- on its remand, its -- it suggested that the local authorities, they made parties to the action, and the property sold free and clear of all liens with the priorities to be determined in allocating the sales proceeds that came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.116" offset="1267858">When the case went back to the county court, they did issue an order saying that it should be so free and clear of all liens but it came up with another special provision that provided that local taxes should be paid as expenses of sale citing the Section 1087 of the New York Civil Practice Act which does appear to say that for purposes of that article, that is the article governing sales pursuant to mortgage foreclosures that for purposes of that article, local taxes shall be considered expenses of sale to be paid by the person handling the sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.009" offset="1455417">That's a very long standing law and might make it right clear at this point that there's no suggestion that this is a law which New York has enacted to, to put something over into federal lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.166" offset="1496064">That 1880 as the date that's fixed in my mind that that law come from my -- I would submit that it has somewhat a different purpose read in context of the New York Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.063" offset="1539636">It doesn't say that they are expenses of sales which says, that they shall be deemed to expenses of sale and while being this quite an ambiguous word, I have a feeling that it means something less than saying that they are expenses of sale.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="389.106" offset="1659800">Well, if that's interpretation of the Court of Appeals (Inaudible) that statute would stop with that.</text>

            <label>Mr. John B. Jones, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="395.058" offset="1683623">I think that's the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.801" offset="1698565">But on -- when this county court judgment again was appealed to the Appellate Division, the Appellate Division modified the judgment and on the grounds that it was necessary to apply what it understood to be the rule of the New Britain case which is cited by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.210" offset="1776201">And that rule was that having determined that the sale should be made and the -- this question of priority should be resolve in the allocation of the fund would be to set aside an amount equal to the amount of the mortgage which the Federal Government had conceded was prior, and setting aside for the amount of mortgage would include any interest do on the mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.416" offset="1877034">Then from all other proceeds, they should go first to pay the federal lien since the federal lien conceded no other priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.402" offset="1909008">Then if the excess proceeds -- if there are still some excess proceeds available, they would be used to pay state taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.038" offset="1939519">And then as the last resort, the state lien could go back against the share of the mortgagee because the state, as a matter of its own internal law had said that it should have priority over the mortgagee.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.059" offset="1991659">This case then went on appeal to the New York Court of Appeals and it was reversed by the New York Court of Appeals in an opinion by Judge Burke and four other judges, with Judge Fuld and Judge Foster dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.619" offset="2045889">They agreed with the Erie County court that the payment of later local taxes as expenses of foreclosure was the proper result under the New York statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.347" offset="2100746">The dissenters took the position which we espouse here that such provision runs directly contrary the decision of this Court in New Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.065" offset="2151633">In looking at this case, it seems to the Government that it's advantageous to recognize that the two liens we're talking about here primarily are the federal tax liens which have been very strongly characterized by this Court over the years as intending to reach every piece of property which the taxpayer owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.274" offset="2236479">It is a lien in support of certainly a basic function of Government and the one that's crucial to the existence, the gathering of revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.254" offset="2276394">At the same time, states typically, place great reliance of -- if not major reliance on the property tax as a source of their revenue and typically the state gives a -- what amounts to a super priority to the property tax in the sense that they -- the state does not care at what point a person acquires an interest in the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.649" offset="2373987">Anybody who wishes to deal with the land must see that the taxes are paid whether they rose prior to his interests, add for his interest or in any other circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.488" offset="2409305">And so, this is really a contest of wills if you will between the Federal Government fighting hard to maintain the supremacy of its federal lien and the state government relying on the fair effort of its legislature to give to the local property tax everything which it can give.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.544" offset="2497599">Now, though this is a struggle between the two jurisdictions, the fact is in the case before us and in all cases which should be decided under the New Britain doctrine, the state is going to be paid because the Federal Government concedes that the state -- it can't -- its grant of priority to the mortgagee is not a sufficient reason for it to step in and forbid the mortgagee from paying the state, and thus the state have a jurisdiction over the mortgagee typically can get its interest from there.</text>

            <label>Mr. John B. Jones, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="669.373" offset="2780871">Well, perhaps at this point that we do think there's something that the mortgagee can do.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.935" offset="2807097">A mortgagee can set up an arrangement which is known perhaps by experience to many of us that they collect the fund for the payment of tax insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.659" offset="2841997">This was involved a little bit in the Bond case and it wasn't litigated.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.412" offset="2857044">And if they set up an escrow fund to pay taxes and insurance, the mortgagee can keep those things current and have immediate notice as soon as there is a likelihood of default.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.454" offset="2901138">The mortgagee pays the taxed themselves, knows what's going on if the monthly payments are not coming in and the escrow fund isn't building up, it knows immediately that there is a danger of running up tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.879" offset="2946905">So therefore, it will have notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.172" offset="2960071">Now, this is not to say that if it lets the matter run on that it has any way to protect itself beyond that point because we can't let him pay the taxes before but we can let him take taxes before the federal lien arises and back to the mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.148" offset="3019943">But after the federal lien arises, he's making a subsequent event after the Federal Government and we see no reason why that event should be maintained but the escrow arrangement will keep him fully current.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.655" offset="3069994">And then since he has immediate notice of the default, he can at that time check the federal tax lien status and see whether he wishes to make further advances or wishes to foreclose.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.183" offset="3112103">And that's a matter which we feel the mortgagee is in a much closer position to us, say, than the Federal Government, because it seems to us that in a great majority of cases, it's going to be the mortgagee who's expose to the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.789" offset="3170513">The Federal Government operates from -- operates with a tremendous number of taxpayers -- how many millions of taxpayers are delinquent -- I don't' offer here.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.410" offset="3208965">I don't know the number but certainly it's more than a number who are delinquent in the hands of any one mortgagee.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.256" offset="3252433">So I would like to state again that the context here is who is going to bear a super priority which the state imposes or which the state grants its own taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.711" offset="3302170">Is it going to be the Federal Government or is it going to be the mortgagee?</text>
            <text syncTime="803.815" offset="3318680">And if there's an inequity in this, in our position, that it should be born by the mortgagee, we would suggest that it comes not from the Federal Government adopting an equitable position but from the state courts refusing to yield the priority of its local lien for any prior right that has vested even before the local lien has come into being.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.187" offset="3432155">In support of the decision below, and I think this is a fair characterization of the brief which had been filed in this Court, there run two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.728" offset="3470294">The first and what I would like to characterize is the nominal thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.261" offset="3492446">It goes on New York property law, Section 1087 which makes these expenses -- makes these payments of local taxes expenses of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.897" offset="3538944">And I think a careful reading of the opinions in the briefs make it clear that none of the parties espousing this view, believe that it can stand alone, that a mere characterization of that nature can't override the clear mandate of this Court in New Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.045" offset="3611564">And I would like to point out that if these local taxes were to be treated as expenses of sale, it would seem hard to find the limit on the expenses which could not be treated as expenses of sale because surely the expenses of sale hitherto an innocuous word for federal tax purposes does indicate something with some relation to the mechanics of posing out an account getting property into -- straightened out and setting out a new title to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.723" offset="3734235">But it doesn't -- and to things that are related to that process.</text>

            <text syncTime="992.828" offset="4074663">The state has given nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.817" offset="4078634">It says that the tax stays with the land no matter what.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.956" offset="4095248">You can't -- he can't have equity against the state tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.826" offset="4106637">So that (Inaudible) -- in the -- the Federal Government has made one move, it would seem to me that if we're talking about equities, the next move is up to the state if they're really that interested in the equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.545" offset="4149582">So I believe that this characterization of expenses of sale as espoused by the respondent here is not sufficient to carry the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.099" offset="4191796">And it must be -- this Court is called upon to either say that the New Britain case did not reach the point which we say it did reach and it's decisive of the question here or else that it was wrongly decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.873" offset="4250833">And thus, I think that is the substance of the argument here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.655" offset="4274030">And the basis for this as it's made, is that local property taxes have historically a very close relationship to land and that there is in people's minds appealing that the local property taxes relate very closely to the services and the protection which are given to the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.550" offset="4345605">And they look to various provisions of local law which show this close relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.475" offset="4369324">Now, I would like to say in the amicus brief there's a suggestion that there is no personal liability for New York property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.020" offset="4407463">We did not answer this in our reply brief but I would like to suggest to the Court that the examination of the New York law will suggest that there is a personal liability for the real property tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1127.449" offset="4613204">Now I'm sure there's a superficial appeal to treating this mystical relationship between the property and its property tax in the local services and viewing every holder of property as having something that can be periodically diminished by local taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.156" offset="4684048">And it's certainly possible to imagine the system of Government that allows this kind of state priority for local property taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.425" offset="4717066">I'm not sure that it would be a better system than our own but it seems to me clear from the decision of this Court, it is not the system which has been adopted and followed for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.769" offset="4758444">The -- in United States v. Schneider in 1893, this Court's spoke in the strongest possible terms about the priority of the federal tax lien, the language that was in the revised statute at that time was I suppose as one could imagine to the present language of the tax laws, the Court pointed out to what extent it was in the work and move of the Constitution that this federal tax lien must have priority over everything in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.203" offset="4884146">And 20 years later, Congress didn't repudiate this decision in any sense but it did announce that there would be specified categories of people who would be protected against this all prevailing tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.562" offset="4945586">That is the Section 3672 which is amply cited to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.427" offset="4965125">And if there was any question about the application of this sup -- of this heavy priority of the Federal Government to state and local taxes, we submit that that was put to rest in the Michigan versus United States case in 1943 where Chief Justice Stone speaking for a unanimous court made it very clear that it would be no grounds for holding that any different rule applied to state and local taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.153" offset="5067943">And he gave full consideration to these arguments about the peculiar nature of the local tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.612" offset="5093857">And then comes to what is to us the key case, one we could submit fully governs here and that is the New Britain case decided 1954 again by a unanimous court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.944" offset="5155192">There, the proceeds of the sale were insufficient to satisfy the mortgagee's federal tax lien and the local taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.285" offset="5188524">It came up to this Court and as a matter of fact, the Government was there arguing to somewhat a stronger or more extreme if you will position that is now arguing, if they're contented that local tax liens were entitled to -- not specifically mentioned in the statute and as long as they were mere liens, it hadn't been reduced the possession, they were entitled to no priority at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.294" offset="5284551">But this Court examined the precedent and legislative history and decided that Congress in enacting the federal tax lien intended to include the first in time, first in right doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.569" offset="5329690">And then it went on to say that any local liens which are superior -- which proceeded in time, the federal tax lien would be given priority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.140" offset="5383920">Then it was left with the question what about the mortgagee who is protected under federal law but not protected under state law and so that the effect of not giving further priority to the local taxes would be to take the local taxes out of his share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.512" offset="5457377">The Court on page 88 spoke very clearly, and I think it completely refutes the contention that they did not consider this imposition on the mortgagee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.328" offset="5512652">There they said, United States is not interested in whether the state receives its taxes and water rents prior to the mortgagees and judgment creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.412" offset="5540968">That is a matter of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.231" offset="5548283">And in context, there's no question that the Court held that that would have to be the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.074" offset="5571688">And we think that this -- there is no reason for departing from this rule at this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.153" offset="6643963">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.970" offset="6647202">They would foreclose their tax lien and there would be no deficiency against the taxpayer owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.084" offset="6699760">First of all, may I point out the essential difference that this Court in the number of decisions as shown to be between a federal tax lien and a real property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.640" offset="6753886">And that the federal tax lien attaches only to the interest of the taxpayer owner in whatever property is the lien against while the real property tax is a lien against the home of the real property including the interest of the owner and the mortgagee, any judgment creditor, anyone who claims any interest in the property would be subject to the real property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.913" offset="6862973">The respondent believes that this decision on the New York Court of Appeals should be sustained for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.047" offset="6895574">The first one is that when the federal tax lien attached to the mortgagor's interest in the real property, it attach subject to the right in the mortgagee to have the real property taxes paid from the proceeds of the foreclosure sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.029" offset="6971538">In this case, our mortgage provides as all New York mortgages do that in case of a default, the mortgagee was entitled to sell the mortgage premises according to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.896" offset="7026918">That is a contract right and the law mentioned is as much apart of the mortgage terms as ordered -- it was set forth in full therein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.117" offset="7071848">And that law is at -- found in Sections 1082 and 1087 of the New York Civil Practice Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.198" offset="7104136">1082 says that when a plaintiff becomes entitled to a final judgment in a foreclosure action, it must direct the sale of the mortgage premises or so much thereof as is needed to discharge the mortgage debt, the expenses of the sale and the cause of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.911" offset="7171009">And Section 1087 of the Civil Practice Act directs the referee appointed to sell the mortgage property unless the judgment otherwise provides to pay the taxes as an expense of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.326" offset="7248645">All of the taxes and assessments which -- let me state that more clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.640" offset="7269961">The judgment directs the referee appointed to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.953" offset="7287202">To pay out of the proceeds of the sale, all taxes and assessments and water rents which are liens on the property and says that the sum -- the sums necessary to make these payments are expenses of the sale with the -- within the meaning of the term as used in any part of that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.358" offset="7360763">These statutes have been a part of the law of New York since 1880 and they are a property right in the mortgagee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.706" offset="7398170">When the mortgagor executed his mortgage, he reduced his ownership rights in the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.401" offset="7425024">And the federal lien attached only to his reduced ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.653" offset="7441951">This reduction in his ownership rights came from the contractual assignment conveyance on mortgage to the mortgagee of this right given under New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.794" offset="7498585">I maintain that the New Britain case does not apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.794" offset="7518542">New Britain as the Government counsel said -- stated started in the Superior Court of Hartford County in Connecticut as an ordinary mortgage foreclosure and proceeded in accordance with the Connecticut foreclosure law until after a sale of the mortgage premises when the proceeds were brought into Court and a supplemental judgment was then rendered which directed the payment from those proceeds of the expenses of the sale, attaches to the City of New Britain the amount to the mortgagee, the amount to the judgment creditor, and the balance to the federal lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.078" offset="7675695">The Government appealed from this decision and at that point, the City of New Britain which had not heretofore -- theretofore have been a party intervenes so that it might contest the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.618" offset="7721880">In the Supreme Court of Errors of the State of Connecticut, the only parties present were the Government and the City of New Britain, and the only issue presented to the Court was the irrelative priority of the federal lien and the city taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.672" offset="7778095">The Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut affirmed the con -- the Superior Court of Hartford County and the Government's petition for certiorari to this Court which was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.475" offset="7825324">And again, in this Court, the only parties present were the City of New Britain and the Government and again, the only question presented was the relative priority of the federal lien and the city taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.729" offset="7894288">It was on remand to the Connecticut Court that the question of relative -- of the rights of the mortgagee and judgment creditor came into consideration because it was the Connecticut's Court which said that the Connecticut procedure required the payment of the real property taxes from the proceeds of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.803" offset="7982582">This Court did not say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.254" offset="8000345">New York procedure does not require that the real property taxes be paid from the proceeds of the sale.Either the property can be so subject to the real property taxes or the judgment can correct that the referee appointed pay them as an expense of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.927" offset="8099088">The New York Court of Appeals in considering this case made the statement that there was no question of circular priority in New York since first the real property taxes were paid as an expense of the sale before the surplus from which the federal lien must be paid was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.298" offset="8184560">My point on that is that since the mortgagee and the judgment creditor were not present in this Court to state their position that any implications in the New Britain judgment -- in the New Britain decision which would indicate whereas the Government claims that the -- this Court intended that the mortgagee should bear the expenses of the real property taxes is over to take the -- as far as they're concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.400" offset="8316949">I point out at this time that in the case of United States against the Ball Construction Company decided in this Court in 1958, four years after the New Britain case, Mr. Justice Whitaker wrote a dissenting opinion which Mr. Justice Douglas and Mr. Justice Burton, and Mr. Justice Harlan joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.070" offset="8419662">And in that dissenting opinion, made the statements that they -- the report of dissenting justices believed that the controversy in New Britain was over that portion of the proceeds of a real estate mortgage foreclosure of sale which exceeded the amount of the mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.324" offset="8500642">It added, we think it is not only apparent that Section 3672 (a) had no application to that case but also that the court expressly so declared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.211" offset="8544214">And further, in New Britain this Court was not dealing with any mortgage pledge or other contractual lien or with any question of priority of an antecedent mortgage over a subsequently filed tax liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.706" offset="8606177">As I say, New Britain did not consider the rights of the mortgagee and judgment creditors and New Britain, anything in it that suggested that the taxes couldn't be paid as an expense of sale is contrary to the later direct holding of this Court in the United States against Brosnan that they might be paid as an expense of sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.265" offset="8716413">As it pointed out in the majority opinion in the Court of Appeals which is set forth at page 80 in the record, the Government's brief in Brosnan brought to this Court's attention of fact that there was a Pennsylvania statute very similar to the New York statute which said that in order to -- when you conduct the foreclosure sale in Pennsylvania, the real property tax is against the mortgage premises have to be paid as an expense of the sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.210" offset="8840234">That was brought to this Court's attention not only in the Government's brief, but also in the opinion in the Circuit Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.931" offset="8867088">And yet, this Court did not consider it as sufficiently valid objection to the Pennsylvania foreclosure procedure to mention it in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.562" offset="8909615">The Court did say in Brosnan that we believe that so far as this Court is concerned the need for uniformity in the collection of federal taxes in these instance is outweighed by the severe dislocation to local property relationships which would result from our disregarding state procedure and to apply New Britain as the Government pressed that it'd be done here would severely dislocate or establish property relations in New York and we put New York mortgagees at a distinct disadvantage to the Pennsylvania mortgagees who do not have to pay the taxes or contribute towards the payment of the federal tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.680" offset="9070111">Furthermore, the affirmance of the New York Court of Appeals' judgment in this case would be in accordance with the intent of Congress when it enacted Section 3672 (a) which is now in the 54 Code 6323 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.336" offset="9144717">That is the section which says that a prior recorded mortgage has had -- has priority over a subsequently filed federal tax lien.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.235" offset="9184319">It would also be in accordance with the intent of Congress at the time that 2410 of Title 28 was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.730" offset="9218278">2410 is the enabling section by which a mortgagee may join the Federal Government in a state foreclosure and cut off the lien of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.864" offset="9266866">House Report 1018 on the 62nd Congress, Second Section at the time they were considering 3672 (a) said there is no reason why the Government should not occupy the same position with reference to liens and properties as does the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.836" offset="9350666">And House Report 95 of the 71st Congress, Second Section at the time 2410 was being considered said that that was offered as legislation to correct the then existing situation where he, the mortgagee, is therefore in effect defeated of his own right to foreclose unless he is willing to pay off the Government lien at that for which he is in no way responsible and he being a person to whom the Government would in no way look for its payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.457" offset="9481174">I respectfully submit that the requirements of Section 3672 (a) are not satisfied by merely setting aside the amount that's due the mortgage debt without regard to whether the mortgagee gets it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.053" offset="9543555">The Government's argument is based on a misinterpretation of New Britain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.255" offset="9564348">I've already pointed out that in 1958 four members of the Court did not think New Britain had anything to do with the rights of mortgagees and judgment creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.213" offset="9608234">But if it did, all the Court said there was, that when competing for payment from the same fund at the same time, the federal lien must take precedence over the state liens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.840" offset="9674689">To sustain the Government's contention would mean that that -- this Court meant in that decision that regardless of what the circumstances or in how remote -- how remote in time, no state procedure can prevent the federal collector from getting his tax from the mortgagee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.482" offset="9765282">I respectfully submit that that was clearly not so stated, no implication to that effect can be found in the reading of the New Britain decision and four members of this Court have thought so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.107" offset="9823796">We contend that the -- both of the judgments which were rendered by the Erie County Court were proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.160" offset="9852008">The first one is subject to the taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.243" offset="9868309">It takes nothing away from the Government because they're not -- there's no competition at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.920" offset="9891088">And the second one provided for the payment by the referee to foreclose as an expense of sale is in accordance with the -- establish New York foreclosure procedure, those statutes have been on the books since 1880 and they're just as much a part of New York law as those Pennsylvania statutes which say same thing are a part of the Pennsylvania law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.733" offset="10002265">If I (Inaudible) -- excuse me, if I have said anything of consequence here the other day, I think it is that the requirements of Section 3672 (a), now 6323 (a) of Title 26 of the U.S. Code are not satisfied by setting aside the amount of the debt without regard to whether the mortgagee is made whole there from or not.</text>

            <text syncTime="3142.535" offset="12673546">Let me say that examples can be multiplied and what's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.737" offset="12698311">If you change the amount of the liens and the example given by the Bar Association and have the large lien be the local tax lien, you'll find the Federal Government by making a grant to a modest grant of priority to a modest mortgage find itself stopped with having the local taxes in large amount paid out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.610" offset="12777827">The hypothetical can be multiplied but they're certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.550" offset="12789530">And this is not to disagree with the point made by Mr. Little that there are occasions when the application of this rule will put the mortgagee with no opportunity during this but foreclose because that will have to be a result in some situations where the tax liens are large in amount and do eat up any remaining equity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.327" offset="12872704">Mr. Little mentioned in the Brosnan case, I think it's important to recognize with him that there was in the record in that case a claim of this nature under New Britain which could have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.912" offset="12927039">It was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.023" offset="12931427">Now I don't know whether that was a matter of Government strategy or Government overconfidence but there was a much more important point in the case which we thought the state procedure should not to be applied at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.099" offset="12975731">And this point was not raised of the -- at the end, the factor of the judgment was that the New Britain point did slip by.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.317" offset="13004675">Point is made in the reply brief that we did not -- we do not now contest this in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.105" offset="13027767">It's quite difficult to turn these cases up under the Brosnan rule because we have to search the record ourselves, find cases where federal interests are involved, and then they have to be ones where the value of the property exceeds that at the mortgage before this point comes up at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.976" offset="13091297">We are, however, raising the point in the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in a case involving Milton Savings Bank and that's under consideration by that Court at that time so is not in any sense conceded it.</text>
