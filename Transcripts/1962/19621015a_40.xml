            <text syncTime="70.593" offset="385755">This case involves two working companies and various individuals who owns stock and worked with companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.843" offset="426715">The case began a few days more than seven years ago when an application was filed for leave -- for approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission to merge these two companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.210" offset="488260">An agreement had been made expressly subject to the approval of the Commission that the companies be merged by stock acquisition and later consolidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.024" offset="539460">Statute involved the Section 5 (2) of the Interstate Commerce Act which is printed at page 81 starting at page 81 of the appendix to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.871" offset="626813">Particular paragraph B on page 82, whenever a transaction, that includes a merger of this sort, is proposed the carriers seeking authority shall permit -- shall present an application in the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.101" offset="691806">Commission shall take certain action, then the Commission shall approve if it finds that the merger is in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.503" offset="749380">Gilbertville is a fairly small general commodity carrier operating in New England and New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.651" offset="785951">Nelson is a specific commodity carrier, as far as interstate rates are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.203" offset="820224">It's associated with the textile industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.877" offset="830882">Also has general commodity authority intrastate into states.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.311" offset="852616">Two and a half months after the merger application was filed then, an investigation was started by the Commission under Section 5 (7) of the Interstate Commerce Act, an investigation to determine whether control or management of the two carriers in a common interest had been effectuated and was continuing.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.984" offset="943313">These two proceedings were consolidated for hearing and later and gradually they grew more and more bound together as the Commission added decision after decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.078" offset="999633">A lengthy hearing was held resulting in many pages of transcript for the trial examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.661" offset="1034010">Participating in the hearing in addition to the applicants, representatives of the eastern territory railroads as protestants and 13 large competitors, motor carriers in New England as well as the Bureau of the Commission, that is the Bureau of -- ingoing compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.141" offset="1119901">There were four issues presented to the trial examiner and to everyone else who decided the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.873" offset="1154905">One of these issues was whether there had been a violation of law that is control or management in the common interest one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.587" offset="1197746">Secondly, if there were, was that violation continuing?</text>
            <text syncTime="278.904" offset="1218957">Because a peculiarity of the Interstate Commerce Act is that the remedial authority of the Commission is to order such action as it's necessary to prevent continuance and other language of the section makes it very clear and the appellees don't contest that continuance is a prerequisite to their remedial jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="359.013" offset="1539427">In this case, I note this as we come through.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.758" offset="1550399">The District Court has departed from the facts expressly and indeed appellees rely on the trial examiner's facts which were different.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.677" offset="1730121">The Nelson Company, L. Nelson &amp; Sons Transportation Company originated first as a partnership of a woman, Mrs. Linnea Nelson and two of her sons and was later incorporated, other sons and members of the family came into the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.125" offset="1815907">And then in 1950, the -- Mrs. Nelson, L. Nelson died.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.576" offset="1845687">At that point, the sons and daughters of L. Nelson started to go their separate ways, some of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.041" offset="1887587">Charles Chilberg managed the corporation as approximately the executives.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.604" offset="1913814">Oscar Chilberg sold the stock and he went and managed a garage in Philadelphia and he has very little further connection in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.591" offset="1953729">Kenneth Nelson sold his stock in September -- September 22 of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.554" offset="1985599">He continued thereafter to have an association with Nelson Company solely as Nelson Company was a client of his as a tariff consultant.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.145" offset="2035963">Let me come to that in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.025" offset="2047457">Another son, Howard, sold his stock and went to the navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.254" offset="2072430">He went back to a surveying job with the navy really.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.744" offset="2086327">A daughter also sold her stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.577" offset="2101687">Thus, there were three stockholders left in L. Nelson &amp; Sons and they are the first three individuals listed in the caption of the case, Charles Chilberg, Clifford Nelson, and Kenneth Nelson.</text>

            <text syncTime="532.417" offset="2233031">I mentioned that Kenneth continued to have some association with Nelson Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.130" offset="2259884">This is a highly rooted issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.045" offset="2283604">The Commission found that Kenneth was a freelance tariff consultant until March 1 of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.117" offset="2323832">Now, the date, March 1 of 1953 is important because the purchase by Kenneth Nelson of the stock with Gilbertville Company did not occur until March 3, that is his taking over control, does not occur until March 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.901" offset="2407006">A contract dated March 2 was signed March 3, the evidences says that the escrow money was deposited in March 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.889" offset="2438980">Later in July, the stock was actually transferred, but I take it that March 3 would be or could be its significant date.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.643" offset="2477955">The appellees, therefore, contend that the March 1 finding by the Commission was an error and they referred to certain alleged evidence to that effect in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.270" offset="2548485">The evidence on which they would ask this Court to find that the Commission was in error and therefore affirmed the Commission, consisted of the testimony of an accountant who had indicated that he was testifying solely from income tax returns who indicated that he could not tell from the income tax returns from the material he had when during a year money was received.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.026" offset="2663528">Who was confused, admittedly so, who inadvertently gave incorrect answers many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.511" offset="2693413">This is all in the record and it's outlined in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.693" offset="2754121">Then this accountant was asked the question as to whether any of the money or the salary or income or what have you that Kenneth was supposed to receive from 1953, was received for services rendered after he bought the stock from Gilbertville Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.707" offset="2842206">The accountant's answer where some of that would have to be which leaves the impression that he was talking about, in the first place, the time he received the money and at the time the services were rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.557" offset="2897586">And secondly, that he was guessing, as he must have been guessing because he had no way of knowing.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.129" offset="2931858">This sounds like delving in trivia and I'd be reluctant to do it except the appellees have made such a point of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.398" offset="2961011">And the appellees are attempting to find here some relationship to sustain the Commission's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.985" offset="2999359">They could argue, I suppose, if they -- that they could create an overlap of the dates, that there would be such a relationship here.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.224" offset="3036244">When I use the word ‘relationship', I'm referring to the definition of affiliation in Section 5 (6) of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="936.527" offset="3849488">Appellees raised some question also as to the Commission's finding of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.993" offset="3871326">Kenneth was a freelance tariff consultant.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.212" offset="3884178">I don't think there needs to be much said about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.297" offset="3896508">The Commission found him freelance and consultant that is an independent contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.848" offset="3918764">There is no evidence that he did not have other clients and I can definitely rest there.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.337" offset="3944678">Back to other facts then and I'm leaving for the moment this tariff consultant career which the appellees find important.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.798" offset="3998595">The purchase of Gilbertville Company was accomplished by Kenneth Nelson going after -- this was a year and a half after he had severed all his connections with Nelson Company except for this freelance tariff consultant.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.151" offset="4051989">He resigned as an officer director.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.218" offset="4060244">He sold his stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.701" offset="4070170">It was purchased by Kenneth Nelson with the aid only of Oscar who had previously -- that is previous to Kenneth, left the Nelson Company and was earning a garage in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.002" offset="4115414">There was much effort spent trying to show that there was some money of the Nelson Company that went to this purchase or some other connection with the Nelson Company and none was shown and none appears in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.487" offset="4177272">The Commission mentions the Bergson Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.019" offset="4191483">Bergson is an outgrowth, sort of a continuation as it were of the administration of the estate of Mrs. Linnea Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.289" offset="4224502">It owns a substantial amount of real estate, part of which is three -- is some four terminals which are used by the Nelson Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.727" offset="4274239">Though these properties used by the Nelson Company is terminal four.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.012" offset="4295450">The other facts and these I take it are the ones in which the Commission thought that common control or management was shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.658" offset="4337977">The other facts include evidence with respect to joint use of terminal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.292" offset="4360547">That is that the Nelson Company and the Gilbertville Company used -- both used three properties which were owned by Bergson Company and one other company, both as terminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.068" offset="4415613">There's nothing unusual about joint use of terminals by carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.463" offset="4433272">It's done all the time particularly by railroad carriers, Grand Central Station and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.635" offset="4457932">Then other terminal facilities, long line communications or teletype went along with the terminal facilities so did telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.024" offset="4507460">These items were paid for by Gilbertville and Nelson and there's never been any evidence or any suggestion other than the District Courts that there was anything improper in the method of each paying for what it used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.583" offset="4585723">There has been no suggestion that the amounts are unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.126" offset="4599829">The District Court observed that they were not shown to the other than arbitrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.648" offset="4621981">And apparently this was a basis of his decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.443" offset="4637132">The basis I should add we claim as clear error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.647" offset="4653955">The burden of proof was most plainly on the Bureau, on the person seeking show violation of law and it was conceded to be by Bureau counsel for the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.147" offset="4695960">So not shown to be other than arbitrary, can be translated to reasonable in light of the burden of proof or ought to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.252" offset="4732426">The Commission speaks of a pool of equipment so-called maintained by Nelson and Gilbertville Company uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.620" offset="4765863">The facts are that the Nelson Company's business was declining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.883" offset="4778924">The textile industry was moving out of New England and that the Nelson Company was tied to that industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.430" offset="4805047">Then Gilbertville Company, on the other hand, was a company which had been undernourished by its sole stockholder previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.302" offset="4860531">That was quite obvious from the debts that have gone up and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.256" offset="4872443">But then it had very valuable operating authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.390" offset="4884982">Kenneth Nelson invested substantial amounts of zone money in his effort and he was young and vigorous, and brought the company up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.326" offset="4920717">But meanwhile, he had serious capital difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.127" offset="4931897">He bought equipment as fast as he could.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.240" offset="4944332">Let me add parenthetically that he bought all new equipment in exception of four used vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.825" offset="4970663">He bought equipment as fast as he could but in the meantime he had to use equipment to run the business and he leased that equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.246" offset="4996368">He leased it from various sources and he leased a substantial amount by far in the majority no question from Nelson Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.147" offset="5031999">But that was equipment that Gilbertville needed and Nelson Company had available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.308" offset="5048613">The evidence is very clear on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.594" offset="5057703">There was no special accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.515" offset="5081422">Let's talk about the same group of drivers but it appears rather clearly that the drivers in this general area as the drivers everywhere are union people who are qualified drivers, the ones lower in the seniority list frequently don't get a day's work here, so they take their various work there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.340" offset="5152684">And that is all that adds up to in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.962" offset="5167208">Much time was spent on interlining and interchanging, which are two common practices growing out of the fact that motor carriers have territorially limited operating authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.543" offset="5213497">One motor carrier simply is not authorized to take a particular shipment through; therefore, it interlines it to another carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.305" offset="5248606">Interchanging is nothing more than interlining consisting of a trade of trailers, one trailer in particular being laid with freight that's being underlined.</text>

            <text syncTime="1878.195" offset="7616136">The evidence is that during two years, 1952 and 1953, Kenneth's income as a tariff consultant came from Nelson Company, this is the accountant's evidence, period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.751" offset="7670366">The career of Kenneth as a tariff consultant started in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.708" offset="7690219">We know nothing about 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.736" offset="7698265">We know nothing about the income that Kenneth may have received subsequent to 1953 for services provided earlier and there is no more direct testimony on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.775" offset="7742464">This is one of those cases that Kenneth Nelson testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.157" offset="7756048">The Bureau did not ask him anything about his tariff consultant career.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.265" offset="7816443">The Commission applied in the rule of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.637" offset="7841938">They relied on a finding that Kenneth Nelson was affiliated with Nelson Company and this is the language of Section 5 (6) of the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.483" offset="7889272">It was affiliated with the Nelson Company at the time he purchased the stock at Gilbertville Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.186" offset="7920097">Therefore, says the Commission, the conclusive presumption of Section 5 (5) applies, therefore, we affirm the conclusions in the prior reports, affirmed the conclusions back and so forth in the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.738" offset="7990314">The thing that's lacking though, quite clearly, is any specification of the relationship in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.778" offset="8022497">Section 5 (6) says, “A person shall be held to be affiliated with the carrier if by reason of the relationship of such person to such carrier at the time in question, it is reasonable to believe that the affairs of any carrier on which control may be acquired by such person will be managed in the interest of such other carrier”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.362" offset="8112776">It asks for a relationship a specific time that makes it reasonable to believe certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.387" offset="8144959">There's no specification of what this relationship is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.376" offset="8156871">Was it because he was a brother?</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.173" offset="8164080">The appellees denied and we would hesitate to think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.897" offset="8182993">Was it this tariff consultant that the appellees care so much about?</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.652" offset="8202010">Was it appellees say it is an intermediary where there is no evidence, not a shred of evidence in the record, of any agency relationship and particularly there's no evidence as of the time of the purchase of Gilbertville which is I want to specify by the Commission here, because Section 5 (5) requires a transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.156" offset="8279960">It only applies to a transaction, it doesn't apply to other relationships or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.603" offset="8313814">This is the basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.771" offset="8322487">This is the reason why we say and there's ample support I believe in the legislative history, there's ample support in the mere fact that Congress has inserted these several sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.525" offset="8365432">That the Section 5 (5) and 5 (6) combination, the conclusive presumption is essentially a different thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.507" offset="8393435">It's a different theory of law and so forth than Section 5 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.658" offset="8414020">This theory then was picked by the Commission departing from Division 4 but without the requisite findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.641" offset="8453935">And as I said before, there is no finding in relationship -- the relationship was no finding of continuance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.411" offset="8480998">Then the matter went up to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.217" offset="8488208">The District Court departed on the facts significantly -- departed on important facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.435" offset="8513076">The District Court said that the basis of his -- of its finding, the violation was the fact that such and such had occurred at the time when Kenneth had -- was not shown to have been, it was not shown to have severed his relationship, the burden of proof on the appellants to prove they did not commit a violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.669" offset="8586010">And then the District Court, as an unprejudiced sophisticated mind, comes to the conclusion that Section 5 (4) has been violated and the District Court has not viewed Sections 5 (5) and 5 (6).</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.672" offset="8642017">This is the basis of our saying that the District Court departed from the long established rule of this Court cited among other Courts of Chancery decision as frequently cited that a decision must be reviewed on the grounds that it takes, then those basically would be the first -- the points with respect to violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.489" offset="8769285">The next question is assuming that there is a violation of law as we see there's not, what is the result of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.886" offset="8802931">The examiner found that the application proceeding or the merger proceeding should be proved nevertheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.135" offset="8827904">Division 4 over struck out on its more stringent policy and the Commission goes along with Division 4 and adopts a more stringent policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.180" offset="8872103">It quotes from a previous case, Central Georgia, where it explains that previously and this is set out as the fitness doctrine in appellant's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.973" offset="8915257">Previously, one thing that was weighed was a violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.196" offset="8932185">It's of course relevant when you're weighing it in this fashion to determine whether or not it's willful because an innocent violation, I take it, would not reflect logically, could not reflect very much on the fitness of the applicants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2261.098" offset="9147747">Now, appellants don't contend and never contended that the Commission cannot change from one policy to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.213" offset="9180244">What the appellants contend is that the policy that the Commission adopted in this case is not a rational policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.754" offset="9214412">It's not a policy in conformance with the Interstate Commerce Act or authorized by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.851" offset="9238758">The more stringent approach quite simply stated is that once a law violation, as the report calls it, is found, the merger -- the approval of the merger will be denied for that reason and for that reason alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="3198.269" offset="12896423">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.034" offset="12907499">The Interstate Commerce Act, Section 5, provides the Commission with authority to approve mergers and acquisitions by one carrier of another or by non-carriers of two or more carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.276" offset="12968521">The statute states that if the Commission determined that such an acquisition will be consistent with the public interest, it shall approve such carriers -- such mergers subject to such conditions as it find to be just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.654" offset="13025991">To assure that the Commission can carry out their statutory purpose, the Act also contains within it -- Section 5 contains within it the most sweeping prohibitions of any mergers, acquisitions or control achieved without the Commission's approval and that is what this case involves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.622" offset="13093909">The Commission found in the order here under attack, the order of June 1959, they found three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.297" offset="13120554">It decided first that appellants had violated Section 5 (4) of the Act by the unlawful common control of these two trucking companies, Nelson Company and Gilbertville Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.482" offset="13165275">It found -- second, it denied the application of the appellants to merge these two companies and third, as a measure of relief to terminate the violation, it directed the appellants to divest themselves of any interest which they had in the acquired company, a second acquired company, the Gilbertville Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.199" offset="13240195">On the first of these issues, the finding of unlawful control, all the tribunals which determine this question, which have look into this question, which have canvassed the record have been unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.977" offset="13287320">The examiner found there was a violation of 5 (4), the Division 4 found it, the Commission found it, and the District Court sustained them on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.408" offset="13329011">Mr. Starrett has discussed some of the practices in which the companies engaged and he's argued that in many situations, there can be legitimate business justifications for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.591" offset="13377703">The issue is not whether any one of these specific practices is illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.589" offset="13393690">The question here is whether taking all these practices together, the Commission could find that the relations of these companies were not those of independent business concerns, doing business with each other but where -- that these two companies, the operations of these two companies were dictated by a common control which had been achieved without Commission approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.818" offset="13482611">I don't want to spend too much time on these factual points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.895" offset="13498911">The -- we've stated in some detail in the statement of facts in our brief but I would like to point out to some of the highlights of the relationships of these companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.157" offset="13536005">After Kenneth Nelson took over Gilbertville Company in March 1953, the District Court -- as the District Court stated there was a convergence of the operation of these two companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.803" offset="13582608">The examiner found specifically that they had developed into what was in effect a one unified organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.867" offset="13610820">Some of the highlights of this are the fact that the Gilbertville headquarters were moved from Gilbertville in Massachusetts to the Nelson Company premises in Rockville, Ellington, Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.900" offset="13655019">The two companies again sharing terminals, they shared four terminals and each one had one additional terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.814" offset="13678634">They shared the same telephone number in seven cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.103" offset="13691800">There was an extensive interchange of freight which developed between the companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.037" offset="13707473">When they interchanged freight, Nelson Company, the original carrier did all the billing and they had the -- they shared the interchange revenues at a fixed percentage contrary to trade practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.995" offset="13755329">There was extensive leasing of equipment from the initial carrier owned by the family to the second carrier from Nelson Company to Gilbertville Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.167" offset="13796080">And what this amounted to in effect was the shifting of equipment from the service under the Nelson Company authority through the service under the Gilbertville Company authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.198" offset="13832129">At the time of the hearing, as a matter of fact, Gilbertville was leasing regularly and continuously from Nelson Company about three times as many vehicles as it had at the time Kenneth Nelson acquired it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.802" offset="13886568">The one remarkable kind of arrangement which was found by the examiner was that they would -- the parties would arrange to change an interchange of freight into a -- through service by a transaction in advance which at the interchange point took effect as a lease of a vehicle from one company to the other and a shift of employment of the driver from one company to the other, thus, enabling the driver to go right through and being transformed in effect from a vehicle of one company to a vehicle of the second company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.490" offset="14029302">As a matter of fact, most of the interchange, according to the testimony of Mr. Chilberg, the principal of Nelson Company, took place -- most of these interchanges took place in a town months in Massachusetts where the parties do not even have a terminal, so this transaction was an automatic kind of thing arranged in advance for the common interest of the two companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.742" offset="14110386">There was a testimony that the principals of each company acted in a managerial relationship with the other company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.408" offset="14144972">The inspectors testified that when they visited the common premises, Kenneth Nelson was not in the Gilbertville office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.471" offset="14173288">The office labeled Gilbertville.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.459" offset="14181230">He was downstairs and as far as he could tell, he was running the business, running both businesses and directing Nelson Company employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.528" offset="14217488">On another occasion, a shared terminal was visited and a principal of the Nelson Company, Clifford Nelson, arranged for the dispatching of a Gilbertville truck and hired a driver for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.893" offset="14270986">There were several occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.503" offset="14285406">Mr. Starrett pointed out that these were four occasions in which the -- in road inspections which were not directed to these companies were -- just checks of the vehicles on the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.684" offset="14326157">The ICC inspectors discovered that a vehicle of one company was carrying freight under the papers, the shipping papers of another company without the formality of transferring papers, the issuance of a new delivery receipt or anything such as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.157" offset="14400031">These items were not presented specifically as individual violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.584" offset="14417690">They were presented to show the context, to show that the companies were not independent business concerns doing business with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.200" offset="14452172">They were companies which were managed in a common interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.431" offset="14469099">And the Commission is certainly suppose to make this judgment on the basis of these facts that is suppose to be the expert familiar with the trucking industry and without companies do business with one another.</text>

            <text syncTime="3965.724" offset="15966229">It took place by means of the acquisition of this very weak company, Gilbertville and by the shifting of equipment, personnel, funds, and energies into the general commodity service which that carrier was able to provide under its certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.544" offset="16033520">Now, if Nelson had come to the Commission in March 1953 and said, “Textile industry in New England is going down, we would like to carry general commodities from Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, all the way down to the District of Columbia, they would have had to prove as the Commission requires in all its proceedings that there's a need for this service.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.954" offset="16115231">They did not so request and yet that is the kind of authority -- that is the authority which they would have if this application would have been granted, taking the Gilbertville's certificate and adding it to a previous acquisition, the Byrnes acquisition by Nelson Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.528" offset="16181478">Nelson Company would have been transmuted from a textile carrier from New England -- in New England and from New England to New York and Philadelphia to a general commodity carrier down as essential part of the eastern seaboard.</text>

            <text syncTime="4832.071" offset="19431633">So what these two additional provisions state is that certain transactions by carriers and other persons were found to be affiliated with them, will constitute a violation of the -- this single prohibition that is in the statute of Section 5 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="4848.262" offset="19496417">The appellants go to some effort to try to separate these provisions of law and to say that a different kind of finding, a different kind of evidence is required to find a violation of the affiliation provisions and is required to find a violation of 5 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="4866.420" offset="19569037">But actually, that is certainly not what Congress intended when it passed this statute and certainly not what the law provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.943" offset="19591189">The Committee reports are very clear on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4875.487" offset="19605295">They state that these 5 (5) and 5 (6) were adopted, and I'm quoting from Committee reports, to spell out and make clear the various possible forms of indirect control which 5 (4) was intended to prohibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4888.388" offset="19656913">To make sure that 5 (4) which is the single prohibition that the Act contains was construed to prevent indirect control regardless of the device that was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4900.997" offset="19707382">In other words, a finding of affiliation in this case is a finding simply that Kenneth Nelson was acting on behalf of Nelson Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.774" offset="19750431">And the finding of violation by use of these provisions is no more than a finding that the unlawful control was accomplished indirectly through an affiliated person, indirectly through Kenneth Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="4926.919" offset="19811035">This is not inconsistent with the findings without using those provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.916" offset="19823052">It's the same thing because it's clear that if any violation did occur in this case, it occurred because Kenneth Nelson purchased the company and by means of his management and control of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4943.273" offset="19876446">As I said earlier, I think it's very clear that the record amply supports the Commission on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.027" offset="19903509">The Commission certainly were justified in its finding that a violation had occurred and that it had occurred through the medium of the Kenneth Nelson's purchase and control of the second carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="5484.645" offset="22041997">And the Commission has found that that acquisition was a means by which the unlawful control occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.283" offset="22064462">The only alternative, which is suggested, that somehow the company should be separated but that Kenneth Nelson should be left as the owner of Gilbertville Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="5511.338" offset="22148681">As a matter of fact, if we refer to a case in another context as you did, Your Honor, the DuPont case, it was suggested that -- the Court stated that it'll pass through the stock would not be adequate because the stockholders shouldn't -- the Court should not be required to assume that the stockholders would act contrary to their interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5529.429" offset="22221093">It was very clear what Kenneth Nelson's interests were.</text>
            <text syncTime="5532.370" offset="22232900">At least it's clear enough for the Commission to have acted on that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5538.908" offset="22259022">The arguments against divestiture, I may say Your Honor, were also presented to the Commission after the entry of the order of June 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.725" offset="22302281">The appellants at that point petitioned for reconsideration and raised all the arguments which are now being raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="5556.632" offset="22329866">They stated the order was too harsh and they suggested that if the Commission issued an order directing him not to share terminals, not to interline freights, not to use vehicles, evidently, not to do -- not to conduct business relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5571.189" offset="22388172">This was opposed -- the Bureau opposed it on the ground that the unlawful control by Kenneth Nelson was an integral part of the violation and that the alternative would essentially left and retain the fruits of the unlawful conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5584.952" offset="22443133">The petition was denied in February of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="5588.801" offset="22458598">And then appellants proposed a very interesting second alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="5594.025" offset="22479496">They proposed a filed petition with the Commission and proposed to cancel the Nelson Company certificate if they could retain Gilbertville.</text>

            <text syncTime="6076.103" offset="24407751">Mr. Justice, I suggested that if there were one or two of these factors that occurred or some of these factors that occurred, I can't conceive on the situation where all of them could occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="6083.721" offset="24438262">And the parties were independent businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="6086.375" offset="24448920">It's certainly not our case here, it's not our record here and I don't know how we can answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6092.437" offset="24473161">Frankly, I can't -- I can't see how we can answer the hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="6095.632" offset="24485909">I would like to add to these factors of relationships which are so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6100.500" offset="24505344">The Commission is supposed to judge these in terms of the industry and to -- to decide for itself whether these were normal business relations between independent concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="6108.552" offset="24537631">I think the record is amply supported.</text>
            <text syncTime="6111.265" offset="24548394">Aside from the business relation themselves, there is the specific relation of Kenneth Nelson with Nelson Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="6118.578" offset="24577651">He was a stockholder and an officer up to September ‘51.</text>
            <text syncTime="6122.304" offset="24592593">After that, the finding is quite clear although he terminated that formal relation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6126.545" offset="24609520">He was in effect an employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="6129.200" offset="24620178">The accountant testified that he was a freelance tariff consultant but the only person who have -- whom he worked, the only person who provided any of his income as tariff consultant was the Nelson Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="6142.453" offset="24673155">He maintained his office in the Nelson Company premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="6146.013" offset="24687470">The accountant also testified that Kenneth Nelson continued to work for Nelson Company after taking over Gilbertville.</text>
            <text syncTime="6153.085" offset="24715682">And this finding was made by the examiner and by Division 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="6161.061" offset="24747656">Under these circumstances, I believe the Commission had ample justifications in the record and in the statute defined unlawful control and violation of Section 5 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="6172.187" offset="24792168">They had ample justifications for using that and considering the public interest, and in deciding that the merger should not be granted, and thereafter an order to terminate the violation in directing divestiture of stock.</text>

            <label>Mr. Loyd M. Starrett</label>
            <text syncTime="6197.572" offset="24893628">If the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="6199.407" offset="24901047">The Central of Georgia rule or the rule of respect for law that Mr. Kestenbaum says it was applied here doesn't really differ significantly from the fitness rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="6213.525" offset="24957471">I think that's pretty clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="6215.483" offset="24965308">That's a sensible weighing process.</text>
            <text syncTime="6218.601" offset="24977742">The fact of the matter is only that rule was not applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6222.363" offset="24992789">And the -- the report of the Commission shows that fairly clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6230.827" offset="25026644">Mr. Kestenbaum says that the reason for that is a so-called Section 5 rule or a rule that prior participation in Section 5 proceedings bar us any claim of any innocence or requires an automatic assumption or presumption of willfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="6253.948" offset="25119117">He further refers to findings or rather I think it's more appropriate to say comment made by the examiner not repeated by the Commission about a so-called plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="6267.713" offset="25174183">Certainly, there's no question that Nelson Company seeing its customers, its textile industries move south from New England decided that it should obtain some route south and it did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="6280.918" offset="25227055">It applied to the Commission for approval of their purchase which was denied and that it applied by the Commission for approval of another purchase, the Byrnes purchase which is approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6291.716" offset="25270209">This is the plan that was talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="6294.057" offset="25279613">There's no question about and it's perfectly lawful plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="6297.528" offset="25293511">The expansion of carriers indeed in territorial terms because of the nature in which routes and authorities are carried up, this is normally done by acquiring authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="6306.422" offset="25329037">There's nothing unusual or strange, or illegal about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6310.575" offset="25345651">But then to say that participation in such proceedings is equivalent to willfulness of any violation found is one step and possible step forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="6327.518" offset="25413465">In this very case, I think the questions from the Court and Mr. Kestenbaum's really inability to say what the Commission did or would have done in specific instance that shows it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6341.241" offset="25468322">There is no -- there's no definition to this as the examiner said to the -- it's the culmination of the things.</text>
            <text syncTime="6349.612" offset="25501863">Here's a case where sum of the parts has been held to be greater or the whole has been held to be greater than sum of its parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6358.180" offset="25536136">Here's a case of a number of innocent things which are held to add up to a violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6363.489" offset="25557347">As the examiner said, there is no reason to believe that individuals -- non-lawyers, even though they knew about Section 5 and demonstrated indeed their deliberation and their intent to comply with Section 5 by applying for approval of mergers, indeed this one, the contract is expressly subject to Commission approval and they came into the Commission for this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="6389.305" offset="25660583">That these people can predict the sophisticated application of the law of all the facts adding up to more than all the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6399.472" offset="25701230">And then indeed that to take the Commission's ground, the ground the Commission substituted Section 5 (5) and 5 (6), that this layman could say that it was going to be possible -- it's going to be reasonable for the Commission to believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="6414.479" offset="25761311">Those are terms of Section 5 (6).</text>
            <text syncTime="6422.489" offset="25793285">Such a presumption is pretty clearly irrational and quite illogical.</text>
            <text syncTime="6431.692" offset="25830170">Now, Mr. Kestenbaum suggested that Section -- Sections 5 (5) and 5 (6) and as 5 (5) with the definition of affiliation in Section 5 (6) are exactly the same thing as Section 5 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="6447.991" offset="25895372">Let me just suggest this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6451.074" offset="25907702">Section 5 (4) applies to control or the power to control as a fact something that can be proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="6461.419" offset="25949080">Section 5 (5) and 5 (6) applied to something which can be believed even if it can't be proved and the congressional history makes it very clear that this was the intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6473.749" offset="25998399">Section 5 (6) says that a man is affiliated if it is reasonable to believe that the affairs of any carrier on which control may be acquired by him will be managed -- will be in the interest of another carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="6487.338" offset="26052733">That's affiliation and then Section 5 (5) makes a transaction by an affiliate like by conclusive presumption a violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6497.609" offset="26093798">It seems fairly clear that there can be such transactions by persons where it's reasonable to believe were in fact there is no control or power to control created.</text>
            <text syncTime="6510.052" offset="26143535">It's a different test and Congress intended it to be a different test so that it could be proven in certain cases where it could not -- where it could not be proven as a matter of fact under 5 (4).</text>
            <text syncTime="6520.856" offset="26186794">It could be proven under 5 (5) or 5 (6) of violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6524.615" offset="26201840">They are quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="6525.574" offset="26205706">Again, 5 (4) can apply to cases that don't involve transactions since Section 5 (5) requires a transaction, requires a purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="6542.043" offset="26271535">And in light of these sophisticated rules, to say that the mere fact of prior involvement in Section 5 or of awareness and the appellants don't deny that they were aware of Section 5 (5) or Section 5 generally in attempting to comply with, that the awareness of the existence of Section 5 means that any stepping across the line even a vague and shadowy line of this sort is willful.</text>
            <text syncTime="6569.388" offset="26380936">There can be no such logical presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="6572.173" offset="26392116">It must be irrational.</text>
