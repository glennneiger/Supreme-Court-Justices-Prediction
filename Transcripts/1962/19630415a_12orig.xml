            <text syncTime="18.203" offset="176149">Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.419" offset="197047">This is an original action brought in this Court by the State of Hawaii against David Bell former Director of Bureau of Budget for whom Kermit Gordon the new Director has been substituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.226" offset="248247">The Budget Director is charged with the responsibility of administering certain provisions of the Hawaii Statehood Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.449" offset="277191">These are the provisions setting up a program for the review of federal need for retained lands and properties in the State of Hawaii and for the conveyance of surplus, unneeded land according to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.679" offset="334137">This Court has granted all motion, full need to file complaint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.756" offset="354408">This case is now before the Court on cross- motion with judgment on the pleadings filed by both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.904" offset="383039">We believe that the case is right for a decision on those cross motions.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.903" offset="406967">The immediate practical issue here involves four housing projects, which constitutes a major part of the Hawaii public housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.316" offset="452629">The military department who controls the land in question have certified that these lands are surplus of the military need.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.098" offset="495783">If our interpretation of the Hawaii Statehood Act is correct then these lands will be conveyed to the state without being placed under auction block to the highest bidder.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.746" offset="550327">To explain the basis of our claim, it is necessary to go back briefly into Hawaiian history.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.711" offset="586167">Hawaii was once a separate independent nation, when it was annexed by the United States in 1898, the United States took without compensation, without payment of compensation, title to all the publicly owned land in the Republic of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.006" offset="675401">These lands were quite expensive, approximately over 44% of the entire land area of the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.274" offset="712495">The legal title to these extensive lands very largely remained in the United States until we were granted statehood in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.394" offset="752933">We have what the Statehood Act called the public land, sometimes called ceded land.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.250" offset="784384">They are other two types of land involved in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="545.464" offset="2285275">In other words, Hawaii was compelled to give up urgently needed lands because they were needed by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.407" offset="2317040">Even though they were rightfully theirs under any equitable principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.614" offset="2337834">Now Hawaii has a shortage of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.921" offset="2351104">Much of the land is mountainous and is capable of very limited use.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.020" offset="2379421">Population density is high as I said a moment ago, and on one island, we have practically all the people 600,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.743" offset="2414320">Here there are extensive holdings by the Federal Government, somehow most of the good ceded lands are located on the Island of Oahu and somehow the Federal Government saw fit to take away most of the ceded land located on the Island of Oahu.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.275" offset="2476492">And most of those lands are badly needed for public housing and for other housing purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.428" offset="2505122">We feel that it was to rectify this inequity that Congress enacted certain provision under Statehood Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.870" offset="2534902">For those provisions, the Statehood Act has offered to us for ratification contain a procedure under which the state would get surface Federal land under that procedure all Federal surface lands in Hawaii whether ceded lands or after acquired land were to be conveyed to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.868" offset="2622882">This procedure was not restricted to ceded land and territorial land as the Solicitor General states.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.242" offset="2660289">It was extended to all Federal lands in Hawaii otherwise there would be no compensation for the state for the best of the ceded and territorial land, which had been taken by the Federal Government without compensation and were permanently lost to Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.845" offset="2726745">The Federal Attorney General in his opinion when he passed on this matter recognized the state equitable position, an equitable claim, here for all surplus Federal land in Hawaii although disagreeing with the State, it saw that the State had an equitable claim in an allotment of unneeded surplus after-acquired land, a claim that Hawaii as he puts it “ought to receive the surplus after-acquired property in compensation for the many sacrifices that Hawaii made for the United States.”</text>
            <text syncTime="692.471" offset="2873240">And as a basis for this, he particularly mentioned extensive ceded land that the United States was not parting with.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.330" offset="2916707">The interpretation to state as containment for does not put it in a favorite position as compared to the other states and obvious comparison is of course the State of Alaska admitted to the union only a year before we were admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.931" offset="2979088">There were no ceded or trust land in State of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.090" offset="2995702">All the Federal land there, were purchased by, purchase of valuable consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.865" offset="3018794">Nonetheless, Alaska was given all of its territorial lands and a grant of over 100 million acres of Federal land, which is 25 times the total acreage that we have in the State of Hawaii.</text>

            <text syncTime="980.410" offset="4025031">The Hawaii Statehood Act contains provisions for the review and conveyance to the State of Hawaii of surplus Federal land in Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.777" offset="4070484">The legal question at bar today is how broad are those provisions?</text>
            <text syncTime="997.484" offset="4093262">The State contends that those provisions cover any surplus Federal land, that for five years after the passage of Statehood Act, the Federal government must review all its Federal landholdings in Hawaii and make conveyances of those which are found to be surplus to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.420" offset="4181034">Here we are talking primarily about military lands because the military departments are the largest Federal landholders in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.894" offset="4218964">Now the Defendant on the other hand claims that these provisions for the review and conveyance of surplus land simply cover the so called ceded lands that the Attorney General spoke of, and the so called territorial lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.749" offset="4294405">How did Congress go about making this provision for the review and conveyance of Federal surplus property in Hawaii?</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.530" offset="4329514">It did this through the provisions of sections 5(e) and 5(c) of the Statehood Act, which are found on page 4 of the Appendix to our complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.235" offset="4396283">The provision which sets up the procedure is Section 5(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.815" offset="4418644">Section 5(e) provides and I quote, “That within five years from the date, Hawaii is admitted into the union, each Federal agency having control of any land or property that is retained by the United States pursuant to sub section (c) and D of this Section shall report to the President, the facts regarding its continued need for such land or property”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.205" offset="4528149">The Section then goes on to provide that if it's determined that there is no need by the United States for the land or the property it shall be conveyed to the State of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.947" offset="4571199">The sub sections coverage in the first place is broad, it refers to any land or property that is retained pursuant to sub-section (c) or D.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.600" offset="4613726">We are not for the moment concerned with sub-section D, but now to turn to sub-section (c), sub-section (c) in turn covers and again I quote, “Any lands and other properties back on the date Hawaii is admitted into the union are set aside pursuant to law for the use of the United States in certain specified matters provided in the Section.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.270" offset="4704423">As to these lands sub-section (c) says, they shall remain the property of the United States, sub-section (e) then builds on sub-section (c) and says, that as to those lands these any lands which are retained the procedures of review, screening, and conveyance if they are surplus shall operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.181" offset="4796061">Sub-section (c) in turn as we see uses broad language, it uses the words any lands and other properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.684" offset="4830124">Sub-section G gives some definitions for the terms that are provided in the Act and referring to lands and other properties, it defines that simply by terms of extension, imposes no limitation whatsoever on the content of any lands and other properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.675" offset="4910059">It does not contain any provision such as the defendant claims is implicit in the Act limiting any lands and other properties to the territorial lands and the ceded lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.573" offset="4965648">There is no such provision in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.400" offset="4981008">We contend that this broad language in Subsection G and the failure of Congress at that point to impose any limitation along with the fact that there is no limitation expressed in Sub-section (c) or in Sub-section (e), indicates that Congress intended this to be a broad provision for the review and conveyance of Federal surplus land in the State of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.118" offset="5087796">This is to carry out the purpose of Congress to provide some sort of recompense to the State of Hawaii for the withdrawal of the best of the ceded lands over the years, lands which from the very beginning, from the annexation resolution itself and shortly there afterwards, were always conceived, always held in a special trust for the State of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.779" offset="5194480">It was as it recommends for the withdrawal, the extensive withdrawals from that category of land that the Congress made the provision question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.264" offset="5272430">There is nothing in the language of the act that says that the lands which are subject to the procedures setup by the act or the termination of need and possible conveyance to the State of Hawaii under Subsection (e), must be lands which otherwise would be conveyable to the State under Subsections 5(a) or 5(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.491" offset="5365321">The defendant, however, says that there is some such limitation implicit on some basis in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.436" offset="5401161">There is not a word in the statute which supports it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.306" offset="5416626">We contend that this is not an appropriate case to make such an implication, even if there were some basis for making an extreme implication of the sort that the defendant suggests, if this were an ordinary statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.857" offset="5486843">The fact must be based that this is not an ordinary statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.971" offset="5503248">This was not an act which was complete and perfectly enacted simply when Congress voted it and the President signed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.879" offset="5534908">There was another legislative body, if you please that had to act on this provision before it could become a law and go into full force and effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.441" offset="5577122">In Subsection 7(b) of the State of the Act, which is reproduced on page 7 of the appendix, a provision is contained which makes an explicit submission of a proposition to the Electorate of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.587" offset="5653713">3 reproduced there asks the Electorate of the State of Hawaii if they consent to the Land Grant provisions contained in the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1564.806" offset="6362572">We cite numerous cases in our reply brief primarily to the effect that where an enactment is submitted for a popular vote and popular ratification, that there is no room for the implication of any of restriction not implicit in the language of the Act itself, and we think this proposition is one which should apply to this statute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.994" offset="6499349">However, what legislative history there is, it's definitely on the side of the State of Hawaii, most cogent items of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.218" offset="6564237">The essential choice that was made in drafting this act, after the three -- after the admission of Alaska in 1958, there were three alternative provisions which for the first time put into the Statehood Bills, a provision for the conveyance of surplus Federal property to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.880" offset="6666846">There are three of these forms which were pending before the House of Interior and Insular Affairs committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.549" offset="6689520">One simply covered the ceded lands, provided for conveyance and surplus ceded lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.573" offset="6713657">The next covered both the surplus ceded and surplus territorial lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.886" offset="6738944">And the third and broadest form is the form that wound up in the act, the form that covers any lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.591" offset="6773739">The House Committee which fixed the final meeting of the Act chose the broadest alternative and it was this form that was enacted into the statute and at the very next session of the congress after this debate was flushed out, after this question came to the court, that very same committee in reporting to the Congress an act designed to implement the procedures under the Statehood Act made an explicit declaration that the state's view of the Act was the proper one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.041" offset="6935489">We quote on page 40 of our opening brief, it's in these terms, the committee stated Subsection (e) is referenced to land or property that is retained by the United States includes in some cases, mainly those covered by Subsection (c) all land whether it falls within the definition of public land given in the act or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.387" offset="7068923">And I might add that the opinion of the Interior Department, which was the executive department most intimately connected with the affairs of Hawaii over the years, accorded with the opinion of the state upon the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.042" offset="7211551">It said, in the circumstances, there is no reason to suppose that Congress did not mean precisely what it said, that lands including but not limited to ceded lands are subject to reporting by federal agencies and possible subsequent conveyance to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.677" offset="7294098">The land subject to the screening provisions at the opinion, and again I quote, “Is also land acquired by the United States by purchase, condemnation, donation or by any other means.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2243.708" offset="9078157">Well, that view was taken for a while by some of the agencies of the government, but the Solicitor General's position now as I understand it is that it applies both to the -- only to the territorial land and to the ceded land, those two categories, otherwise he is in trouble with definition in Section 5(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.146" offset="9179930">He contends that, that language amounts to a word of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.660" offset="9198007">That it can only apply to ceded lands and to territorial lands, that it can't apply to anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.000" offset="9235414">Our position is that those words in the context of course do apply to territorial and ceded lands, there is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.642" offset="9277942">It's common ground for both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.512" offset="9285465">But we contend that they are broad enough to apply to the formal processes under which the United States acquired the after-acquired federal lands, that is to the processes of purchase condemnation, gifts, inheritance, the buys and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.545" offset="9365504">More precisely to the status of those lands after they were acquired through these processes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.560" offset="9401657">Our position is that once there is a condemnation of land or a purchase of land for a specific federal purpose, that land can be spoken off as being set aside, as being appropriated for that specific federal purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.317" offset="9468635">And that, that wording of the Act is broad enough to cover the processes thereby -- rather the status resulting after land was condemned or purchased by the United States for a specific federal purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.526" offset="9537494">Now the defendant has attempted to create a sort of myth, a sort of structure about the words set aside and he has gone to some lengths to do this, at one point the Federal Attorney General's opinion says that the word traced back to the 1898 joint resolution of Congress annexing Hawaii, but one may look through that resolution in vain for the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.564" offset="9645641">Then the Attorney General said that the word set aside has a very particular meaning dealing with Hawaii, and one example of this very specialized usage of the words in connection with Hawaii occurs in Section 16(b), where the words set aside are used, this is on Page 16 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2411.567" offset="9749608">What the Attorney General seems to have overlooked in citing that as a specific use of terminology that was peculiar to the State of Hawaii, is that, that provision is copied verbatim from the Alaska Statehood Act which was passed the year before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.294" offset="9820557">The next provision that the Attorney General, pardon me the Solicitor General says is indicative of a specialized peculiar restrictive meaning for the words set aside is Section 91 of the Hawaii Organic Act, which was the provision permitting withdrawals of ceded land.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.616" offset="9921808">And again that provision doesn't use the words set aside, it talks about taking the land for the usage and purposes of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.786" offset="9954513">Actually the same sort of language that one uses in cases of condemnation and goodly proportion of the orders withdrawing land that are pursuant to Section 91, don't use the word set aside either, they use the word withdrawn or the words reserved or the words taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.366" offset="10048867">Again we are not saying that the words set aside are inappropriate to describe the processes whereby the ceded lands and the territorial lands were withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.137" offset="10091917">We simply say that, that terminology had not reached the stage of being a word of art, that it couldn't be restricted to that usage, that it fits just as well the situation in which after lands are purchased or condemned, they are appropriated, they are withdrawn, they are truly set aside for a specific use of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.062" offset="10203617">And we cite in our briefs, cases in which the courts have used the language set aside and the synonym such as set apart and appropriate in referring to the status of lands after they are condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.253" offset="10276342">There is a substantial judicial usage of the terms along these lines including opinions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.616" offset="10341857">Another basis on which we contend that the language of subsection (c) and of subsection (e) is not simply an exception to the language of 5(a) and 5(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.283" offset="10408521">Is the fact that there was an alternative bill before the House Committee, HR 1918 it was styled, which very clearly attained the result which the defendant contends Congress attained in the statute as passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.703" offset="10494203">This form of the bill was not chosen by the House Committee when it settled the language of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.085" offset="10523669">Instead it chose the broad form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.475" offset="10533282">Now the defendant says that the differences are only editorial changes, that they are simply matters of drafting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.866" offset="10570794">If this was the case, we must marvel as we stated in our reply brief at the number of drafting errors and drafting problems that the draftsman made when he put to one side the version which clearly accomplished what the defendant contends for and drafted the final form of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.260" offset="10680404">In the first place he included definitions in Section 5(g) of the Act, which are entirely too broad and entirely unnecessary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3066.088" offset="12367705">My argument like the state's will be limited to the question on the merits, the interpretation of the Statehood Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.929" offset="12391111">I don't mean by any means to waive our sovereign in defense, but that question is near to the Court and you recently had occasion to consider it and I think I can help you more, if I devote myself to try to unravel the Statehood Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.065" offset="12455581">I also like to suggest to the Court that if the Court does agree with the United States or with the defendant, on the merits, would be proper to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a cause of action without passing on the jurisdictional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.003" offset="12523395">The Court has done that on a number of occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.722" offset="12534262">Unfortunately, we didn't cite the cases in our brief, but I have supplied the clerk with a lists of such cases, which will be available if the Court should request it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.350" offset="12580760">As background to the interpretation to the Statehood Act, I want briefly to summarize the nature of the land holding in Hawaii, the governmental land holdings in Hawaii at the time of the Statehood Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3132.430" offset="12633109">The first major category with the ceded lands, which were given to the United States on annexation by the Republic of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.829" offset="12670725">Those were initially governed by the Joint Resolution of Annexation, which appears at page 20 of the appendix to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.777" offset="12710431">That gave United States title, however it provided that the ceded lands were not to be governed by the general land laws of the United States and rather that except for such part of the lands as were used or occupied by the United States for civil or military purposes, the lands would be used solely for the benefit of the inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.414" offset="12813040">Now that created the trust concept and that undertaking was carried out two years later in the Hawaiian Organic Act, which of course was the basic charter created in the territorial government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.394" offset="12872913">The provision concerning the control of the ceded property is Section 91 of the Organic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.256" offset="12908440">And that Section is in the government's case is central point and we think it is the key to an understanding of the Statehood Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.031" offset="12947519">It appears at page 63 of the government's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.048" offset="12971551">The first sentence I would like to read part of it, provides that the property that was ceded to the United States by the Republic of Hawaii shall remain in the possession, use and control of the territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.263" offset="13032469">Until otherwise provided for by Congress or taken for the uses and purposes of the United States by direction of the President or of the Governor of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.412" offset="13088998">Now that provision thus gave Hawaii the territory possession of the all the ceded properties subject only to the power to withdraw specific parcels for federal use.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.604" offset="13137795">They could be withdrawn under 91, Section 91 of the Organic Act by Act of Congress, by direction of the President or by direction of the Governor of Hawaii, and that as we will later show is the direct antecedent of Section, subsection (c) of the Land Grant Provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.657" offset="13209997">I would also like to note at the beginning of the next sentence, because that we will also show is the antecedent to Section -- subsection (e).</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.054" offset="13243538">That provided that any such public property so taken for the uses and purposes of the Untied States maybe restored to its previous status by direction of the President.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.473" offset="13289305">That is to say the President could terminate the set aside or withdrawal of the land and return it to the possession of the territory.</text>

            <text syncTime="3359.990" offset="13543320">The second category of lands are those that the territorial government acquired in its own right, with the territorial revenues that purchased lands or condemned lands for its own public uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.058" offset="13595564">Now in 1941, the outbreak of World War II, the Section 73 (2) of the Organic Act, which is also printed in our appendix was amended to make clear that even those lands could be set aside for Federal use by direction of the Governor of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.054" offset="13675604">I might say -- I don't think it's particularly relevant, that Section does use the word set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.299" offset="13700577">I don't attach any imaginary meaning to the word set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.173" offset="13724087">The third category of lands probably governmental lands were those that the United States purchased from private owners either voluntarily or through condemnation procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.992" offset="13775391">The status of those lands was exactly the same as land purchased in anyplace in the world by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.453" offset="13801200">There is nothing in the Organic Act or any other law relating specifically to Hawaii that has any particular bearing on the status of land the United States purchased from private owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.007" offset="13855431">And as I say, their status was the same as that of any land, any place else in the world that United States may have purchased, governed by the same rules of acquisition and disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.147" offset="13899943">We had possession, the territory had no interest at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.437" offset="13913109">Those are the three categories, the ceded land between the possession only of the territory subject to the right of its law, the territorial lands which the territory owned and possessed subject again to the right of withdrawal and the United States purchase of properties which United States owned outright and absolutely and possessed solely itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3478.379" offset="14016867">On reading the State of the Act of the land grant provisions against that back ground, I think its meaning becomes clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.384" offset="14048946">Section 5 begins in page 3 of the State's appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3493.233" offset="14076322">Now, I want to start at the beginning and go through rather than start at the end and work backwards that the State does and I think that really makes the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.484" offset="14117282">Subsection (a) says that except as provided in Subsection (c), the state shall succeed to the title of the territory and those lands and other properties in which the territory now holds title.</text>

            <text syncTime="3542.391" offset="14272972">Subsection D then served that except as provided in Subsection (c) and D, the United States grants to the State of Hawaii, the United States title to all the public lands and other public property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.092" offset="14339741">Now public lands and other public property is defined is subsection G as ceded lands.</text>

            <text syncTime="3615.771" offset="14566484">Now what is -- at least the primary purpose of that is undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3620.079" offset="14583724">Its primary purpose is to carve out an exception from the grants made in (a) and (b), both of which referred Subsection (c) as an exception and I would note that this specifically incorporates the property set aside for the use of United States under sections 91 and 73(q) of the Organic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.442" offset="14689155">And in fact, enumerates all the ways in which such set asides might be affected by act of Congress or by correction of the Governor or the President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.536" offset="14733563">Now the question in the case is whether Subsection (c) does something more than that and I will comeback to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.739" offset="14754356">I want to go ahead and complete the outline of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.167" offset="14772015">Subsection (d) is not immediately relevant, but it has some bearing in the development of the act in legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.384" offset="14812871">What it does, Subsection (c) related to land that were set aside up to the date of Statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.107" offset="14839829">Subsection (d) continues the power to make additional set asides for five years beyond the date of admission, though it is limited to ceded lands that are in fact in the possession of the United States though under informal arrangements with the territory rather than under form of set asides.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.205" offset="14944214">In fact it simply gave the military five more years aside which of those that wanted to set aside which to allow to go to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.508" offset="14973367">We come then to Subsection (e), which is the focal point or at least initially of the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.628" offset="15001893">So that applies to any land or property that is retained by the United States pursuant to Subsections (c) and (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.854" offset="15046823">Now any property so retained, the President is required to reappraise – to see if it is still needed for Federal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.329" offset="15092694">If he concludes that is not needed for Federal purposes, it is to be conveyed to the state, any surplus properties within that category, namely lands retained pursuant to Subsection (c) and (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.497" offset="15149328">Now basically the position of the Government, of the defendant, I'm representing Mr. Gordon if I [Inaudible] I hope you will understand, our position is that the lands retained pursuant (c) are simply those which (c) reserved out of the grants made in (a) and (b), namely the ceded and territorial land which had been set aside and therefore were reserved by (c) out of the grants.</text>

            <text syncTime="3811.120" offset="15347858">The reason that this statute necessarily does not use the narrower term public land is because it also applies to the territorial lands, which is not ceded land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.003" offset="15395401">The set aside -- it is the knowledge some of the set aside properties originated as territorially purchased property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3831.935" offset="15431137">They were not ceded properties, and they could be set aside under 73(q) of the Organic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.775" offset="15454438">And to make these provision broad enough to include such property, it was necessarily to use the language any land rather than any public land.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.580" offset="15489651">Public land is a narrower term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.624" offset="15497906">I think that is a red herring in that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3852.728" offset="15514311">The statutes to begin with -- but let me just -- the statutes to begin with any land or any person is fairly common, you then carve down initially all inclusive categories and here it is carved down initially any land that is retained pursuant to Subsection (c) and the question is what that limiting phrase means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.899" offset="15619009">Now, before I go back to Subsection (c), I would like to -- initially a question of interpreting that phrase in Subsection (e); now pursuant to Subsection (c) could mean that the State assumed that it means simply as declared Subsection (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="3898.225" offset="15696227">It's enough if Subsection (c) declares to retain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.594" offset="15709706">Another meaning and I think a more plausible one is that pursuant to Subjection (c) means by virtue of subjection (c), something that the United States retained because of Subsection (c) that it would have not have retained without it and if the later is the meaning, it does not include purchased properties because we would have kept purchased properties if Subsection (c) had never been in the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.126" offset="15811897">This is the reason simply being that there was nothing giving them away, there is no need to have a provision saying anything about them and they would have remained our property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.000" offset="15851395">And reading the reference pursuant to Subsection (c) as a reference to a operational provision, it does not include purchased property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.887" offset="15898937">We retained the purchased properties not pursuant to Subsection (c), but by virtue of the absence in the act of anything giving them away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3959.910" offset="15943032">That's a complete answer of the state's case, probably even going back to the Subsection (c).</text>

            <text syncTime="4059.248" offset="16340407">Now, but I will assume for the moment that it will be enough to satisfy Subsection (e) if you could find in Subsection (c) simply a declaration that after all the government was retaining purchased property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.679" offset="16390040">It would be an unnecessary declaration to have that, but if it was there, I will agree arguendo that would bring it within Subsection (e), and then turn back to Subsection (c) itself, because I think I can show that it doesn't contain such a declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="4089.865" offset="16462869">And now in looking at Subsection (c), I first want to emphasis that there is no disagreement about its operative function.</text>

            <text syncTime="4098.145" offset="16495992">Independent force is solely as an exception to (a) and (b).</text>

            <text syncTime="4117.028" offset="16571434">The difference is that the state says, where it also recites, simply declares that the United States is retaining the purchased lands unnecessarily, but they didn't have simply a declaration that provides a predicate for the later operation of Subsection (b).</text>

            <text syncTime="4186.993" offset="16851362">(a) rather unusual category I think and what it is explained by, that choice of language is explained by the Organic Act, which had conferred the power to withdraw ceded properties and later the territorial properties under the -- by the enumerated means.</text>

            <text syncTime="4221.523" offset="16989497">Now the state also -- state says that it -- nevertheless they agree that does that, but they it is also broad enough to encompass purchased properties and it constituted a declaration that the purchased properties are to remain the properties of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.440" offset="17053132">I would say first that if the words could be made to do that, it remained a very awkward way to describe a purchased property as the setting aside pursuant to law for the use of United States under an act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.925" offset="17111124">It's a very cumbersome way to say property purchased by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4258.136" offset="17135888">I want to show that the words can't be made to fit and the state says that when you purchase property or condemn it, it is set aside for the use of the United States presumably from all the other property in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.760" offset="17198373">And that it's pursuant to law under an act of Congress, because Federal agent can buy property only if it's been authorized to do so by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4282.760" offset="17234422">Now, I would like to break that up into two steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="4284.835" offset="17242676">First, set aside for the use of the United States, that phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="4289.699" offset="17262216">Now it says for the use of the United State and it seems to me that the words used and implied were a transfer of use and possession, not a transfer of title, set aside the use of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.752" offset="17326373">You remove it from the possession of one person to the possession of another, not a transfer of title.</text>
            <text syncTime="4311.512" offset="17349465">Now they try to get over that problem by speaking of the dedication of purchased property to a specific Federal use, you take it for defense uses rather than some other use and that is a setting apart for a particular use, but the statute doesn't talk about setting aside for particular uses, it talks about setting aside for the use of the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="4956.073" offset="19927646">The other aspect is the statute speaks of setting aside pursuant to law under any of the four means.</text>
            <text syncTime="4963.384" offset="19956903">Now they say the relevant one mean is pursuant to law under an act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.746" offset="19986369">Now in their use that becomes a redundancy, because the act of Congress they talk about is the one that authorized the acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4979.693" offset="20022105">Now, in our interpretation it is not a redundancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4984.428" offset="20041122">Pursuant law is pursuant to the reserved power in the Organic Act, the alternative means of setting things aside by an act of Congress, means an act of Congress setting aside a specific parcel pursuant to that reserved power, and that was done for example in the creation of the National Park, The Hawaii National Park in the Act of 1916 specifically set aside a large area of ceded property for use as a National Park.</text>
            <text syncTime="5015.209" offset="20164211">So in that use there is no redundancy, pursuant to law and pursuant to the authorizing statute under an act of Congress, is an act of Congress which executes that authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="5457.135" offset="21931865">The form of that is set out in skeletal form at page 47 of the government's brief, the Lands Act provisions in that bill consisted of only subsections (a) and (b); (a), like the act was limited to territorial property and (b) was limited to ceded properties, they also were subject to the reservation of set aside, except that the reservations were incorporated partly into the granting clauses as provisos.</text>

            <text syncTime="5508.915" offset="22139068">And similarly subsection (b) repeated in verbatim the same proviso now that was admitted necessarily limited to those two types of land because it's partly incorporated into the granting clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5522.258" offset="22192358">That bill was reported out by the House Committee in House Report 2700.</text>
            <text syncTime="5528.281" offset="22216495">The House Committee kept the same form and added two changes to subsection (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="5535.529" offset="22245439">They extended for five years the power to make further set asides, an unlimited power for five more years to make set aside of the ceded properties and secondly they added a second proviso which appears in page 48 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5549.251" offset="22300400">That proviso -- second proviso provided further that the provisions of section 91 of the Hawaiian Organic Act which authorized the President to restore to their previous status land set aside for the use of the United States shall continue in effect for a period of five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.336" offset="22368737">Now that is the origin of the notion that ultimately became subsection (e) of a post-conveyance reappraisal of our need for the set aside and their re-conveyance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.432" offset="22409070">And that was in the 85th Congress, the Committee Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="5580.397" offset="22424952">Now that did not pass and the 86th Congress, which is the one that in which the bill was finally enacted, new bills were put into the hopper. Represent -- delegate Burns introduced H.R.50.</text>

            <text syncTime="7103.907" offset="28519006">It is not Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="7105.850" offset="28526738">It's a newly discovered law I'm afraid to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="7109.541" offset="28541576">The defendant says that the Act as passed simply evolved from HR50.</text>
            <text syncTime="7118.486" offset="28577311">Now there was an alternative form which the committee rejected before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="7123.069" offset="28595597">HR1918, which expressly set out and did concisely and accurately what the defendant claims the final bill did.</text>
            <text syncTime="7131.516" offset="28629452">What the draftsmen did was to reject that form and to use the form that refers to any lands and other property.</text>
            <text syncTime="7144.626" offset="28681906">In the final analysis though, this Act is one that was ratified by the Electorate of the State of Hawaii after being submitted to them expressly for ratification on the land grant provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="7162.066" offset="28751600">On that basis we contend that it is entirely inappropriate to go into the Act in trying to construct upon it implicit references of the most opaque sort to Section 91 of the Statehood -- of the Organic Act, which the Act never cites, to Section 73(q) of the Act, which the Act never cites and which never uses the language anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="7188.520" offset="28857448">We think that the approach, the mode that should be followed in reading this Act is the one that Mr. Justice Holmes once said that this is an Act which has been adopted by the people, just as -- he was -- the constitutional provision about which he was speaking was, and he said there the a popular enactment, this is [Inaudible], must be read and I quote “In a sense most obvious to the common understanding at the time of its adoption, for it was for public adoption that it was proposed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="7224.431" offset="29001122">In this case Your Honors the state stands on the fair literal meaning of the Act which we believe the most potent words of the legislative history in support.</text>
