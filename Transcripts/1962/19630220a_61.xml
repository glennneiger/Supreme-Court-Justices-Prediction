            <label>Mr. Luther Hudson</label>
            <text syncTime="11.512" offset="149400">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, when a lawyer stands up to argue a case before the Court, the traditional, may it please the Court, is always seem to me to be somewhat like the same lawyer who holds up a high ball to his friend and says, “here is to you” and drinks it himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.219" offset="236231">He, in a sense, has intention of pleasing himself or his client by his argument rather than the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.189" offset="268100">Now, I express that view to an English Solicitor and had a 45-minute lecture, as a result, as the derivation of that phrase that it had nothing to do with making the Court happy, that it derived from the, I suppose law equivalent of, may the Court be pleased to agree with me and grant my prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.566" offset="365589">And that it was used, he told me and I'm sure he's right, in a sense that may I convince the Court, may I get the Court to agree with me.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.449" offset="413132">Now, if I'm going to get the Court to agree with me in this case, I think that I'm going to have to argue the case not with a broad-brush that was used by counsel for the petitioners, but to confine the argument as much as I'm permitted to the exact facts of the case, what is actually before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.859" offset="510830">What we have here is a case in which a complaint was filed and it was dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.134" offset="567881">We haven't tried the case on the merits, had the petitioners elected to accept order of dismissal and try it in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.210" offset="608214">We might have been here on the merits and the counsel could have pointed out how he had been mistreated or I might be able to point out how the Texas Court had misinterpreted the law depending on the outcome of the trial, but it is not that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.228" offset="668296">We have here a simple question of the jurisdiction of the District Court to hear a lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.465" offset="697240">Not a theoretical lawsuit, not a lawsuit that might have been filed, not involving questions that might or might not arise, but one that is presented by the complaint filed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.267" offset="752410">The complaint fails to show jurisdiction for at least two reasons, one, which, frankly was not raised in the trial court of the court below and that is that this complaint was based solely on Section 1331 (a), there being no diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.823" offset="846660">And there was a failure to allege that each of the individual plaintiffs had a lawsuit involving more than $10,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.875" offset="886888">I don't want to spend a lot of time arguing the point, but I do want to suggest one thing to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.089" offset="907682">In the reply, petitioners have asked to leave to amend under, I believe that's Section 1653 with provides that amendments to this -- to furnish defective -- correct, defective allegations or jurisdictions may be made on the terms in the trial or Appellate Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.761" offset="1382379">My point is that under this Section, the right to amend, adapt that any party after he has a judgment against him in the trial court, can be allowed to amend to show that the trial court's judgment is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.979" offset="1459284">To reduce it to absurdity, a suit is filed without diversity in the United States District Court on an ordinary automobile accident and the court dismisses it because there's no diversity and there's no federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.718" offset="1522291">So on appeal, leave is made to correct it by showing that the suit is one which does involve a federal question setting up an entirely different cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="658.129" offset="2735940">That is no question but what the contract was entered into under that statute and that will let me bring one of the points I want to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.548" offset="2773556">There are ‘any number' of cases, I'd say any number, there must be 10 or 15 cases in which both this Court and the Circuit Courts have said that a refusal to abide by that law and enter into a contract is a federal right.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.015" offset="2839385">That is the cause of action to force a compliance with that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.302" offset="2860596">There are no cases which says that -- which say that after you have complied with the statute, a cause of action arises under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.565" offset="2897586">I can make an illustration Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.706" offset="2906154">In my state as in most states, there is a statute that says, automobiles must be operated with adequate breaks.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.596" offset="2949726">An allegation that the automobile was operated with breaks that were inadequate would arise under that statute, but an allegation that an automobile was equipped with adequate breaks and the statute complied with would not rise under that.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.270" offset="3020466">So we come to the single question and I think it is in this case and that is where the plaintiff's cause of action arises under the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.832" offset="3066650">And for that purpose, Your Honor, it makes no difference whether it's 1331 or 1337.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.380" offset="3092877">The test arises is the same under both.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.671" offset="3118059">First, let's see what the plaintiff's complaint shows.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.101" offset="3135822">All he says -- all he says is that back in 1955 or 1957, I've forgotten which, a contract was entered into as required by the Railway Labor Act between the union and the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.433" offset="3201128">And then as part of that contract, there was a system board of adjustment created that these six individual employees were discharged and each filed his grievance and each was processed up to including the system board of adjustment which deadlocked and a neutral was called in and the neutral entered award which ordered reinstatement with back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.600" offset="3301752">And to answer the question which Mr. Justice White asked, this award is not a money award because the amount is not stated in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.581" offset="3329651">It is merely that is left for determination either by the party's agreement or by litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.573" offset="3357654">So that is the lawsuit that he alleges.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.861" offset="3370820">He says he wants that award enforced and for the court to determine the amount that he's entitled to, and order the defendant to give him back his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.875" offset="3422856">Now, let's stop there, attached to the petition is a copy of the award that he's suing on, the award that he says, “Gives him a cause of action.”</text>
            <text syncTime="842.011" offset="3471444">The award that he says entitles him to the relief he asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.722" offset="3498297">That award doesn't mention the Railroad Labor Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.264" offset="3512404">It doesn't appear in the award even by inference or by a reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.919" offset="3531003">It refers to a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.621" offset="3541870">It refers to provisions for the working of overtime and the giving of notices for the processing of grievances and for the representation by union representatives of the employees and grievance procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.165" offset="3620028">He sues here not by a reason of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.219" offset="3640299">There isn't a statute in the books that says that he is entitled to reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.083" offset="3671751">There isn't a statute in the books that says he's not entitled to reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.452" offset="3693171">There's not a statute in the book that says he works overtime.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.907" offset="3711039">There's not a statute in the book that says we can discharge him if he doesn't work overtime when he's ordered to.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.261" offset="3736430">There's not statute in the book that says that the grievances must be handled as they were in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.382" offset="3764851">There is no possible statute which says that this man can recover or cannot recover.</text>

            <text syncTime="2538.607" offset="10257847">I think Mr. Justice Black that the case you were thinking of that you had written was Bell v. Hood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.847" offset="10282715">We haven't cited in our brief, but it appears at 327 U.S. 678.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.381" offset="10328900">This action to enforce a system board award does not exist in limbo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.867" offset="10354813">Some law must apply which says that this action is good or is no good.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.070" offset="10383653">That law, by everybody's concession is federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.438" offset="10401102">There seems to us inescapable that once it is said that it is federal law which makes this action good, the case arises under a law regulating commerce or under a federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.066" offset="10455646">If that is correct, then the general jurisdictional statutes give us a right to be in a Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.637" offset="10485948">It doesn't matter whether the airport or the Railway Labor Act omitted a specific conferment of jurisdiction by inadvertence or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.767" offset="10526490">Our question then would be not was there an inadvertent omission of jurisdiction as specific to confirm it either in the airport or the Railway Labor Act rather is there anything you can draw from the Railway Labor Act which would show an implied repeal of the general jurisdictional statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.854" offset="10610813">And unless there is something in the airport or the Railway Labor Act to show an implied repeal, we are properly in a Federal District Court because Congress since 1875 has said, “If you have an action arising under a law, regulating commerce or under a federal law, you maybe in a Federal District Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.556" offset="10689599">Now, let's illustrate it in this case by the very point Mr. Hudson says, he wants to make whenever he gets to a court to try this case on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.159" offset="10728051">He says that an arbitrator here made a mistake because as he concedes that there were two issues to be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.357" offset="10764831">The arbitrator decided one issue and rendered a judgment based or rendered an award based solely on that one issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.468" offset="10793253">That award is therefore void because it didn't decide all the things that should have been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.081" offset="10819688">The contract here says that the award shall be final, binding, and conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.369" offset="10848841">How far back a final, binding and conclusive responding can go to show error becomes a question of federal law, because it is federal law which will spell out whether our contract, when it says final, binding and conclusive means utter finality so that you cannot go back of it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.989" offset="10943300">It means almost utter finality so you can go back off it, somewhat to show some basic prejudicial defect, like bias of the arbitrator or fraud, or it can go back a good deal further to show that there was not enough evidence to support the award, or it can go all the way back and redo the whole thing de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.948" offset="11031176">But whether you give it utter finality or give it no finality at all, depends upon what the federal law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.984" offset="11063359">So it seems to us inescapable that what we have here is a question of federal law, a case arising under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.030" offset="11095542">We have a claim which must bring -- which must have support from some law and the only law we have is federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.776" offset="11126471">Now, this is not a question of invidious comparison between state courts and federal courts as one better than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.828" offset="11154683">Congress has said when it enacted the general jurisdictional statutes that for the enforcement of federal rights, you can go into a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.837" offset="11186761">Now, if there's any invidiousness in this field, it's because the general jurisdictional statutes have said they want -- the Congress wants two court systems at work here and we're not here saying we want to be in a federal court because we like federal courts better than state courts or we think state courts are worst than federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.000" offset="11259382">We are in a federal court because Congress says with this kind of a claim we can be in a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.746" offset="11282369">Now, in any specific case, the lawyer make -- may have a big mistake as to his choice are forum and not know until he's all through, that he has made a mistake, but obviously, one doesn't decide jurisdictional questions on that kind of an invidious basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2859.060" offset="11539623">The statute doesn't say specifically when it confers jurisdiction on a Federal District Court to enforce an NRAB award that it's exclusively in the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.784" offset="11586539">I read it that way, but I think it's open to argument that it may not be that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.697" offset="11610154">I read it that way because there are certain other perquisites to getting into a Federal District Court like attorney's fees that can be paid if you prevail, the cost of the suit are borne out of the appropriations of the United States Courts, these things may show that under the -- when you bring a suit in effect -- that the only place you can bring an NRAB suit to enforce an award is in a Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.451" offset="11713181">Now, what we say here is that if you want to distinguish between what you can do with the system board award and an NRAB award, the differentiation would be that for an NRAB award, you must go only into a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.399" offset="11776920">With a system board award, you may go either into a federal court or into a state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.798" offset="11798549">But the differentiation does not argue in favor of saying that the only place you can go with this kind of a suit is into a state court which is the argument that is made here by the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.072" offset="11847659">Now, I think I can illustrate this by two things which have already been adverted to and may profitability perhaps be repeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.401" offset="11877021">Now, the court below bases its view on two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.190" offset="11896142">It speculates that in 1936, state courts were hostile to the enforcement of an executory agreement to arbitrate, but favorable to the enforcement of an award once it is rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.104" offset="11943790">Now, in Texas, it happens -- the law happens to be the common law rule that you can revoke in executory agreement to arbitrate at any time prior to actual submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.531" offset="11985481">Now, the Court says because the state courts were hospitable to the enforcement of an award, we imply that Congress was willing to have this whole system, at least with respect to the enforcement of an award, be committed exclusively to the state court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.735" offset="12050265">But you take that same speculation and the Court has been saying because the state courts are inhospitable to the enforcement of the executory agreements to arbitrate, well that kind of a suit you can get in to a Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.026" offset="12107525">That means if you carry it out, that I can sue Central Airlines to force them to go through arbitration and get into a Federal District Court to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.310" offset="12156635">Having done that, if an award issues then the Federal District Court has no power to bring to fruition the very thing that it has the power to start, we can't cut this baby in half there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.919" offset="12203029">If the Federal District Court has the power to enforce the executory agreement to arbitrate, it surely must have the power to carry through the process and enforce the award and the other part is the one that Mr. Justice Goldberg mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.751" offset="12262379">If a Federal District Court has the power, as we think it has, to enjoin a strike if a dispute is pending before an adjustment board, certainly it has the power having protected the process, then bring it to fruition by enforcing an award which eventually raises from that procedure.</text>
