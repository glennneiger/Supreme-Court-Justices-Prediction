            <text syncTime="10.226" offset="144280">Mr. Chief Justice, gentlemen of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.683" offset="174059">This case comes to this Court from -- on appeal from two judgments of the Supreme Court of the State of Kansas in which there were affirmed two orders of the State Corporation Commission of that state, one dated October 9th, 1959 and the other dated February 3rd, but effective February 8th, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.623" offset="313866">The first order complained of was directed to Northern Natural Gas Company alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.492" offset="353364">The second order was directed to all purchasers of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.921" offset="387009">Each order requested or required that the Pipeline Purchasing Company purchase gas ratably from all of the wells connected to its system in the first instance and the testimony in the case related solely to the, what is known as the Kansas Hugoton Gas Field, although of course there are other gas fields in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.416" offset="549073">The real issue in the case is whether the orders and rule here under appeal which on their face and in their intended operative effect regulates sales of gas in interstate commerce for resale are valid in view of the Natural Gas Act and the rules and the regulations of the Federal Power Commission promulgated pursuant thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.235" offset="704345">Northern Natural Gas Company is a corporation engaged in the business of purchasing and transporting natural gas in interstate commerce for resale, for ultimate public consumption, and is therefore a natural gas company as defined in the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.957" offset="839241">The Hugoton Gas Field is a rather large gas field.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.589" offset="873723">Attached to the first memorandum that was filed in this matter in behalf of the Federal Power Commission, you will find a plat that relates to the portion of the Hugoton Field --</text>

            <text syncTime="221.884" offset="990960">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.942" offset="1007156">This plat shows the general outline of the portion of the Hugoton Gas Field that is in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.996" offset="1067342">Other portion of this gas field extends on through Oklahoma, principally Texas County, Oklahoma, and then another portion is located in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.546" offset="1141530">Of course, each portion of this great gas field is supervised by -- as to production by the State Regulatory Agency of the particular state in which that portion is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.595" offset="1245706">In 1930, Northern Natural Gas Company began to purchase gas in the Kansas Hugoton Gas Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.858" offset="1326791">One of its two principal purchase contracts in that field was made in 1930 by the predecessor companies of what is now Northern Natural Gas Company as purchaser and Republic Natural Gas Company as seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.107" offset="1427832">In this particular record, the supplementary or amended contract which was made in 1945 is made a part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.757" offset="1498363">For convenience sake, it is referred to as the Republic “A” contract because it was the initial contract made between Northern as purchaser and Republic “A” as seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.346" offset="1564714">Some eight years later, Northern began to make additional purchase contracts for gas from the Kansas Hugoton Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.109" offset="1627826">And among those contracts, there are -- there is another republic contract so to differentiate between the contracts, we call the first one Republic “A” and the second one, the Republic “B” contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.617" offset="1705880">In this first or the Republic “A” contract, there was an agreement for Northern to purchase or pay for, in other words, a take or pay for provision relating to a maximum as well as a minimum volume of gas during each contract year.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.427" offset="1821132">Each and all of the other gas purchase contracts which Northern has in the Kansas Hugoton Field required Northern to purchase gas from the connections thereunder ratably as between the wells and accepts from that provision and that requirement, the take or pay for obligations under the Republic “A” contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.007" offset="1975359">In 1952, this take or pay for provision in the Republic “A” contract was before the Kansas Supreme Court for interpretation with respect to Northern’s obligations in view of the basic proration order which was in effect in the Kansas Hugoton Field that’s an order addressed to producers, requiring ratable production as between all the wells in the field and in that proceeding, the Kansas Supreme Court interpreted that contract as to require Northern to purchase the legal allowables assigned to the Republic “A” wells, no more or no less.</text>

          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="531.038" stopTime="537.255">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="531.038" offset="2227493">I'd -- I didn't get that last, just that last statement in what the Commission did.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_h_adams" startTime="537.255" stopTime="764.242">
            <label>Mr. Mark H. Adams, Sr.</label>
            <text syncTime="537.255" offset="2252361">Mr. Chief Justice, I think maybe if I amplified it a little bit, it'd be -- the Kansas Corporation Commission in 1944 promulgated what they call the basic proration order for the Kansas Hugoton Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.037" offset="2351522">Under the provisions of that order, there are market demand hearings, each six months, and a market demand determination made for the succeeding six months, October 1st and April 1st -- I believe in March, I've forgotten, April 1st, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.524" offset="2465520">Then under that proration order, deliverability tests are taken of all the wells to determine in effect their comparable reserved position.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.767" offset="2530408">Then on that deliverability test, that market demand is spread over all the wells in the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.617" offset="2565831">Now this is a very large field so there is -- there are provisions giving tolerance with respect to when you may run the allowable from a well.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.440" offset="2653184">The field is some 80 miles long and I forgot about 60 miles wide, something like that in Kansas alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.156" offset="2691950">So it's quite a job to maintain ratable production as between the wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.882" offset="2722879">You also have the problem of summer valleys in-year demand than winter peaks in-year demand from a pipeline situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.189" offset="2780139">With the result that the basic proration order gives the producer a tolerance to produce sometime during the year up to six times the January allowable assigned to the well or it may go down to six times under, so you have that tolerance.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.376" offset="2896854">Now this matter went to the Kansas Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.393" offset="2912946">Republic contended, that's a long way to get back to your question but I think with this explanation, it would be a little more understandable, Republic contended in that action that Northern was required to purchase under this contract not the allowable but the maximum six -- at that time it's three times, presently, it's six times January.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.024" offset="3031437">They said, “You've got to produce the -- purchase the maximum at all times instead of what we call the zero line, the allowable.”</text>
            <text syncTime="745.018" offset="3083473">And the Court said, “No, it's what is the allowable”, in other words, legal allowable that is assigned to those wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.354" offset="3120776">Now there are about 143 wells under the Republic “A” contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="803.515" offset="3317426">There -- there -- Northern has about 125 now gas purchase contracts in the Kansas Hugoton Field in all connecting to Northern system about 1100 wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.123" offset="3431842">There are about 4000 wells in all in the Kansas Hugoton Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.967" offset="3467264">Now in -- from the time of the inception of production in the Kansas Hugoton Field, until 1944, I think production started perhaps in 1932 or thereabouts.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.089" offset="3551692">In 1944 and forward for the next eight years, the facts show that ratability as to production between the wells in the field was pretty well maintained bearing in mind that there were variations in it, but it was usually brought back in a reasonable time to what I referred to as the zero line.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.653" offset="3697977">In 1958, they have developed a material difference than the experience that -- which had occurred before in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.773" offset="3782510">In the first place, the record shows that there were two reasons for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.406" offset="3825037">Beginning in 1956, the Kansas Commission departed from its previous practices in determining market demand and spreading allowables.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.212" offset="3924198">Now the validity of that practice, if the Court please, is not here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.360" offset="3960769">That question is before the Kansas Supreme Court in some other litigation, but as a result of that practice in 1958, the wells in the Kansas Hugoton Field carried on Commission's schedules about 130 billion cubic feet of allowables in excess of the production from the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.733" offset="4106324">That meant, of course, that if Northern was going to comply with the Republic “A” contract, since we had no way to determine until the Court determined it, whether these excessive, as we say allowables, were the legal allowables.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.444" offset="4197125">We were compelled to purchase the legal allowable or the allowables fixed, carried on the Commission schedule from the Republic “A” wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.901" offset="4246967">Now that meant of course that our market requirements from the field were not sufficient for us to take the legal allowables or to -- from all of the other wells because more of it was soaked up and went to the Republic “A” wells then was available for the other wells.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.835" offset="4342680">So that beginning in 1958, there was a departure from that zero line as between the purchasers by Northern from the Republic “A” wells and its purchasers from the other wells to which it was connected in the Kansas Hugoton Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.604" offset="4433795">There was another reason that the record shows for this disparity and takes or purchasers was that Northern had purchased additional gas supply in some other areas believing that it was necessary to support some applications for additional markets and the proceedings in those respects before the Federal Power Commission got bogged down and there was this unexpected substantial delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.140" offset="4595963">So Northern was contractually bound to make more purchases of gas from other fields temporarily than it had expected to be obligated for.</text>

            <text syncTime="3273.424" offset="13197040">If it please the Court, the appellants ask the state ratable state orders on the grounds they are void under the Supremacy Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.234" offset="13236328">In this regard, it seems to me they raise two questions; one, does the Natural Gas Act deprive the state, State of Kansas of the authority to require ratable taking simply because it is asserted that the Natural Gas Act preempts the field of the regulation over interstate sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.355" offset="13316786">Now this is a question totally unrelated to the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.914" offset="13335071">The FPC does not think that this question is to be answered permanently, nor does the appellee, though appellant has obviously stressed that particular aspect of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.618" offset="13373837">The second question is that, are the Kansas ratable take orders though of the type otherwise valid?</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.865" offset="13410826">In other words, assuming and affirming again to the first question, void because of the special contractual provision in Northern's contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.295" offset="13452518">Now, appellee says that both of these questions should be answered in the negative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.064" offset="13471640">It is useful before disposing of these two contentions to review just briefly the orders that the state entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.771" offset="13510405">These orders are reproduced in our brief and -- on pages 1 and 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.121" offset="13535901">Now on page 1, the first order in its pertinent part is set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.706" offset="13566203">All it does as can be seen from bottom of the page is order Northern National Gas Company both to pay for gas ratably from all wells which it is connected in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.927" offset="13619075">Now this is a specific order addressed to Northern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.261" offset="13632449">It pertains only to Hugoton Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.020" offset="13643421">The second order set out in more detail on page 2 is a broader order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.528" offset="13669439">It applies to all purchasers of gas in Kansas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.970" offset="13683231">It applies to all common sources of supply, all gas fields in Kansas most of which do not cross state lines and are located solely within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.029" offset="13723460">And this order simply says, “All purchasers take gas ratably.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.772" offset="13750418">It described that ratable production in terms of keeping your over and under production within a reasonable balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.171" offset="13792005">Now it is clear from meeting these orders that the orders don't mention price.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.577" offset="13813635">They do not set price as was attempted in the city service fees which [Inaudible] have found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.133" offset="13835891">They do not tell the purchaser how much gas he is to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.367" offset="13852818">They don't tell him to take any gas if he doesn't want to take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.389" offset="13868910">All it says is if you want to take gas, do so fairly, do so ratably, so that the producers within the State of Kansas, so the landowners within the State of Kansas are protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="4752.690" offset="19114088">Now these facts were expressed in terms of percentages in the record, percentages of over production and under production.</text>
            <text syncTime="4758.813" offset="19138644">Northern was taking from Republic 4.29% overproduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.483" offset="19161318">Whereas, it was taking from its other connections 522.09% underproduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="4772.955" offset="19195173">So there was a tremendous difference in the takes which was resulting in drainage as one particular witness testified and he concluded, and I quote, “Currently the correlative rights are being damaged in a great amount.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4787.266" offset="19252433">Honorable, Mr. Justice Goldberg referred to Kansas Supreme Court conclusion to the same effect that drainage was in fact occurred, and that it needed to be stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="4797.767" offset="19294438">There's no question about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.399" offset="19300916">Counsel here has even admitted it but in the record he says there is no question since January or maybe March, 1958, there has not been a ratable taking on the connections of Northern wells as reflected in the Exhibit 7.</text>

            <text syncTime="5697.456" offset="22893171">Alright, now, let's get to the contract question.</text>
            <text syncTime="5699.227" offset="22900276">I hope I have disposed of the -- what I call the non-contractual questions on the basic principle of what the states could do prior to 1938, they can continue to do after 1938 under the Natural Gas Act and that therefore, the Natural Gas Act does not conflict with the state order.</text>
            <text syncTime="5718.133" offset="22975927">That's my first point and I hope I've made that clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="5720.721" offset="22986271">Now, the second point does consider these contractual questions which so many questions have been posed to me about and that question is, are the Kansas orders, draw the type otherwise valid or the type historically they could issue the point as to -- is applied to appellant because of its special contractual arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5740.121" offset="23063907">Now of course the essence of this argument is, as many of you pointed out, that if the appellant complies with the state's ratable take orders, it will and I'm going to underline, under its contracts, have to pay for gas it does not take.</text>
            <text syncTime="5753.589" offset="23117720">Such payment they contend would be passed on to the consumer and that because there's increase in price passed to the consumer, there is a conflict to the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5764.411" offset="23160978">Now, what interests me about this argument as I touch on just briefly is that privately -- the argument is that private contract can be used to avoid state order.</text>

            <text syncTime="5830.193" offset="23424188">The argument introduced by appellant in this regard that there's going to be a payment passed on to the consumer and that their contracts supersede our orders, produces bizarre results.</text>
            <text syncTime="5843.785" offset="23478523">Under the argument in that effect is that the Kansas orders would be valid as applied to all inner pipelines but they don't contend our orders are not valid unless this take or pay provision is in the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5857.056" offset="23531604">They take the take or pay provision out and our orders are perfectly valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5861.050" offset="23547591">The order presumably would also be valid if their contract was amended when their take or pay provision is taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="5867.842" offset="23574758">In short, the Kansas orders would be valid in importance with its contractual whims of appellant and I don't think that's the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5876.002" offset="23607359">If its -- if it is the law, it's a fine way for a pipeline company to avoid all kinds of state orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5880.944" offset="23627107">I've mentioned one before and let's take another example.</text>
            <text syncTime="5883.512" offset="23637452">Supposing a pipeline company agrees to pay 15 cents per Mcf for its gas and if it takes a million cubic feet a day, and then it says, but if the Kansas order requires us to take less, we'll pay 20 cents per Mcf.</text>
            <text syncTime="5900.138" offset="23703907">Now, this is the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5901.125" offset="23707878">We're going to take 15 cents per Mcf, per a million cubic feet a day, but if the Kansas orders us to take a lesser amount of gas, we'll pay you 20 cents per Mcf for the amount we can take at the end of this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="5914.914" offset="23763048">Then, having entered into the contract, they come to us and they say, “Look, your order is valid” -- I mean void.</text>
            <text syncTime="5920.671" offset="23786036">“Your order is void.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5922.539" offset="23793560">It's absolutely void.</text>
            <text syncTime="5923.516" offset="23797426">It causes us to increase our price of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5929.088" offset="23819682">Is this a valid way to avoid legitimate state orders to protect the public interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="5933.511" offset="23837445">Let's take a third example; Supposing that a pipeline company enters into an agreement with its producers and says, “Look, we'll pay so much for gas on the basis that you as the producer, can drill on every 160 acres”, but if the Kansas Commission comes along and says, “Oh no, you have to drill on 640 acres nevertheless, we'll pay you as if you drilled on a 160”.</text>
            <text syncTime="5959.345" offset="23940786">In other words, if you buy -- in other words, by contract, they agree that if they can't comply with state orders, they'll pay an increased amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="5969.563" offset="23981641">Then they come along and they argue oh!</text>
            <text syncTime="5971.909" offset="23991045">Look, these Kansas orders are all bad.</text>
            <text syncTime="5974.480" offset="24001285">They call us to increase our price of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5978.228" offset="24016332">Now, it just doesn't seem to me that a company who is supposed to be regulated by a state agency, who's supposed to be regulated by the FPC, can be allowed by its own contracts to determine whether an order is void or not void.</text>
            <text syncTime="5992.197" offset="24072129">Now, nevertheless, the appellant asserts that these orders create conflict to Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5997.172" offset="24092087">I assert that is not true that whether there's to be an increase is solely within the hands of the Federal Power Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="6793.984" offset="27279339">Now, for the foregoing reasons, I would like to submit that this Court heard the decision of the Kansas Supreme Court upholding the validity of the ratable take orders and I urge you to do so because it will accomplish justice.</text>
