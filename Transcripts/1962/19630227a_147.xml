            <text syncTime="2772.085" offset="11191672">The first is Haley versus Ohio, 332 U.S. 596.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.434" offset="11209122">In that case, the petitioner was 15 years old contrasted to Mr. Haynes' age of 25 to 30.</text>

            <text syncTime="2792.857" offset="11274846">He denied implication in the crime until he was shown alleged confessions of coconspirators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.741" offset="11306297">On the other hand, Petitioner Haynes admitted from the very inception that he was the guilty party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.155" offset="11332002">The petition -- Mr. Haley, the young man, was told that his confession was voluntary and he was told that no promises have been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.718" offset="11366275">He was not asked this question as was petitioner, Mr. Haynes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2830.677" offset="11426043">His mother wasn't permitted to see him for five days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.837" offset="11438686">He had no court appearance for three days after the confession was signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.443" offset="11465122">And there was some evidence of physical abuse in that case without citing the law that this Court set forth had held that this case depended basically upon the tender years of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.082" offset="11519666">And this Court held that what transpired would make -- make this pass for careful inquiry if a mature man were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.941" offset="11567104">It then went on the hold because this was a mere child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.030" offset="11579538">The record should be very carefully scrutinized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.287" offset="11612557">Referring to the nighttime interrogation from midnight to 5 a.m. by relays by police officers, the Court held in part, we cannot believe that a lad of tender years is a match for the police in such a contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2891.258" offset="11668355">In Gallegos versus Colorado, a recent case cited by this Court, the petitioner was only 14 years of age.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.011" offset="11707434">His formal confession was signed five days after his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.380" offset="11724884">He'd been held incommunicado all of this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.562" offset="11737631">His mother actually sought to see him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.462" offset="11745259">She actually went to see him and was refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.736" offset="11758320">This Court, citing the Haley case, held that the fact that the petitioner was only 14 years of age, puts this case on the same footing as Haley versus Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.318" offset="11804609">They held in part, we deal with the person who is not equal to the police in knowledge and understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.925" offset="11831045">In that language, in those two cases, I feel is the -- the crux of the situation here because I submit that the petitioner, Raymond Haynes, was very equal to the police in knowledge and understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.093" offset="11883708">In the Gallegos -- the case of Gallegos versus Colorado, this Court held that the young man, 14 years of age, cannot be compared with an adult in full position of his senses and knowledgeable of the consequences of his admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.061" offset="11943581">And therefore, even though Mr. Gallegos confessed immediately upon his arrest, they held it because he didn't know what his constitutional rights were, that this immediate confession shouldn't be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.572" offset="11993631">But in this case, Mr. Haynes, I submit, had the adequate edu -- as adequate an education as Mr.Crooker did in the case of Crooker versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.642" offset="12045981">Mr. Crooker had a college education and some law school training.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.837" offset="12066670">I asked you to consider the conduct of a law -- a freshman in law school when detained by the police and then consider a man in the position of Mr. Haynes when detained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.189" offset="12116093">A man who had been convicted of, I believe, six crimes, five of them serious crimes, three of them appeared to be felonies, one of them was armed robbery, the facts indicated in this case, he had committed another armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.620" offset="12165831">He'd been on parole, I think, the record said for some two years is that -- is as indicated in the decision of the Washington State Supreme Court with no disrespect, they held this man was not a lamb.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.645" offset="12217971">I feel that under the facts, he was as adequately equipped to deal with the police as Mr. Crooker was in the case of Crooker versus California.</text>

            <text syncTime="3347.923" offset="13495045">The petitioners have assumed the reason, I'm not -- I can't say why he made that request.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.619" offset="13577801">To touch briefly upon what has been charged in the petitioner's supplemental brief as an unlawful arrest in the consequent, illegal seizure of oral declarations from the accused, I briefly state that our position is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.803" offset="13658572">That first of all, this attack was raised for the first time not in the trial court, not in the State Supreme Court, not in the petition for certiorari, not in the petitioner's brief on the merits, but for the first time by the petitioner's supplemental brief filed before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.044" offset="13747597">There were no objections or motions made before the trial court on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.434" offset="13761076">The Supreme Court of the State of Washington was not permitted to consider it, whether or not the arrest was unlawful, whether the admissions were illegally seized under the authority cited in the respondent's reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.292" offset="13820531">I submit that that matter is not here for consideration at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.012" offset="13851460">Assuming that an objection was made, it was not properly preserved according to the state practice which requires assignments of error in the briefs and actual argument in the brief on the point alleged to be error under authority of Beck versus Washington, 369 U.S. 541.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.349" offset="13916766">I submit that an illegal arrest and search and seizure of oral declarations is not an enlargement of an argument made in the state court system that was discussed in the case of Wilson versus Crooker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.708" offset="13970160">Now assuming, just for the purpose of argument, that the error had been preserved the facts conclusively show that the arrest was lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.544" offset="14005582">There was a description of the guilty party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.108" offset="14019793">A policeman testified that the petitioner was stopped but he didn't quite fit the description.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.820" offset="14038601">The petitioner himself says that when they stopped him, they asked him about another man, “Did you see somebody go by?”</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.465" offset="14065246">Or words to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.926" offset="14075068">He was released.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.092" offset="14079770">At that point he was released.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.493" offset="14085308">He walked up the sidewalk of a house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.190" offset="14096175">The policeman waited, he returned, got back in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.292" offset="14116551">The policeman was still seated in the patrol car apparently for time he walked up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.092" offset="14131702">He surrendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.911" offset="14135045">He said, “You've got me, let's go.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.179" offset="14148106">When he talked to Lieutenant Wakeley, Lieutenant Wakeley testified that he said, he might as well give up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.371" offset="14172871">So he told them he was the man they were looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.671" offset="14182066">That's what Petitioner Haynes told Lieutenant Wakeley about the surrender.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.079" offset="14195649">And in his written confession, he said, “I gave up the ghost.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.368" offset="14212890">The meaning of that is pretty obvious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.445" offset="14221145">“I gave up the ghost”, and told him, “I might as well ride downtown with him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.847" offset="14246745">The petitioner seeks to apply the doctrine of Wong Sun versus the United States to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.446" offset="14269106">I feel that the facts are a great deal different in Wong Sun where doors were broken down on partial information regarding assumed possession of contraband or narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.345" offset="14324799">In this particular case, we have to assume that the arrest was illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.291" offset="14340577">I submit that the arrest was not illegal but the petitioner surrendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.936" offset="14359071">When he surrendered and at that moment, he was arrested not before because he was merely questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.144" offset="14379969">He says, the petitioner himself says he was questioned as to whether somebody else might have gone by or run by or been in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.262" offset="14408391">So when he was questioned at that moment or when he admitted at that moment that he gave up, he then was taken into custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.762" offset="14442454">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3591.935" offset="14471084">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.031" offset="14495535">We have in this case a number of factors that the Court has considered in the past in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.105" offset="14531793">The difficulty with applying a subjective rule to determine whether there was a voluntary confession or a coerced confession is highlighted by this case just in the fact that the two brothers, one of whom had no criminal experience before and was belligerent as testified by the police officer refused to confess at first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.286" offset="14624475">And this man who had had a prior criminal experience at some length, confessed initially and then confessed before his brother.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.161" offset="14672018">Therefore, I think the subjective rule or the subjective factor is not a good basis in which to determine the inadmissibility of a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.515" offset="14717471">By looking at the objective facts as to what the police did and whether their methods were impermissible under the standards of a civilized society, I think will give a standard here, a more exact standard, in determining the admissibility of the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.290" offset="14788524">Here, the police did hold the man incommunicado and they did it for a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.710" offset="14818200">And the purpose was to nail the case down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.384" offset="14836903">And they continued to attempt to nail the case down not only after getting the signed confession in the interrogation room of the police department but there was also subsequent attempt to get succeeding confessions signed before the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.947" offset="14927182">The police admit they have this practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.649" offset="14942020">I think that -- to suggest that the man could have made phone calls before he was placed on small book would -- is totally unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.576" offset="14985697">I think the small book is merely an expression of police department policy but as far as police department practice is concerned, it's fairly evident that this man could not have made a phone call out anytime until he was booked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.566" offset="15053615">Now, it's been suggested that at first, that he could -- that they were awaiting to present this to the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.217" offset="15092276">However, it's to be noted that he wasn't brought before a magistrate until four o'clock in the afternoon.</text>

            <text syncTime="3759.436" offset="15141073">Yes, and this appears in the written confession itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.951" offset="15163225">There are some things we don't know about what was said in the interrogation by this man by the police officer since there was no secretary present and this was not taken down, but in the written confession itself, there was a request by him to see the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.090" offset="15227695">Now, Spokane is like most that is I assumed that the magistrate was available at ten o'clock or nine o'clock in the morning, the following morning after his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.591" offset="15273775">Nevertheless, he was not brought before a magistrate at that time when he could have been informed of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3799.197" offset="15300211">He could have at that point, attempted to contact an attorney perhaps although we can't tell for sure from this record whether this was possible simply because of the fact that he wasn't able to -- as he can testify to contact an attorney for or to contact his wife to contact an attorney for several days after the confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="3840.838" offset="15466768">Well, I think it can be done in several fashions, Mr. Justice Goldberg.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.873" offset="15502817">It can be done in the way the Court has looked at the cases in the past in looking at a totality of circumstances and seeing whether the totality adds up to some impermissible method.</text>
            <text syncTime="3864.556" offset="15561644">This would involve looking at the factors of the incommunicado detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.348" offset="15580766">It would look at the factors of not bringing before a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.139" offset="15599888">It would look at the factor of not advising the individual of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.181" offset="15628100">It would look at the factor of whether he had counsel to advice him, if he requests a counsel at any time before signing a confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.667" offset="15690062">I also urge the Court that it could be done on anyone of these factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.165" offset="15716080">There was a statement in the case of Ward versus Texas which indicates this but as yet the Court has not made any ruling on that one score.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.520" offset="15757458">And the cases that have come up to the Court in which the particular emphasis has been on the -- that facet of the Due Process Clause involving the right to counsel in Cicenia versus Lagay and Crooker versus California.</text>

            <text syncTime="3938.266" offset="15856410">But those cases, perhaps, can be distinguishable although in answer to Mr. Justice Stewart yesterday, I urge that they'd be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.740" offset="15894340">They can be distinguished, I believe, on the grounds that in both cases, in Crooker, there was evident in the record that he had been advised of his right to refuse to answer questions and that the statements would be used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3963.545" offset="15957556">Also, there was that very unique circumstance that he had attended law school and presumably therefore knew what his rights were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3972.722" offset="15994232">In Cicenia, there was a similar awareness of rights and there was a contact with an attorney, with an assumption that an attorney had, in fact, consulted with him prior to his surrender at the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.520" offset="16057448">Now, in both of those cases, it seem to me that one of these facets that I've mentioned has had been satisfied as far as the courts are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.099" offset="16091721">And I suggest that this is a distinction in -- as far as those two cases are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.619" offset="16117844">There's nothing in the record here to indicate that this man had an opportunity to consult with an attorney, to talk with an attorney before he confessed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4351.346" offset="17508707">The exclusionary rule has had a benefit on police lawlessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.318" offset="17540681">There -- were refusing cries about the Mallory-McNabb rule and I realized that that was based on the supervisorial capacity of the Court over the -- over the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4373.212" offset="17596270">But in spite of the cries that the adoption of McNabb-Mallory rule would prevent efficient law enforcement, efficient law enforcement has gone on within the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4387.407" offset="17653008">Oliver Gasch who was formally the U.S. Attorney here indicated that that was only an issue in approximately 5% of the cases and it has had some effect on the police practices here to the extent that arrests for investigation are to be ended here in the District of Columbia after a thorough study by indicating that they were unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="4412.679" offset="17754049">The effect of Mapp versus Ohio is completely still too early to say, however, the benefit of experience in the States that have the exclusionary rule indicated that it had a beneficial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.581" offset="17821654">But we have had, in the courts since 1936, a series of so-called coerced confession cases in which they have been earmarked by arrest on suspicion, incommunicado interrogation which involves refusal to permit contact with friends and relatives, no informing of rights to silence in the counsel, delay in bringing before magistrates and a denial of bail and a denial of writ of habeas corpus during that interim period.</text>
            <text syncTime="4463.133" offset="17955924">The governments and the states have in effect become lawbreakers and there's a very intimate relationship between the willingness of the people to observe laws and their cynicism which will develop if they feel that the Government itself is a lawbreaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="4483.089" offset="18035754">Justice Brandeis in his dissenting opinion in Olmstead, it seems to me, made the most eloquent statement as to the value of this.</text>

            <text syncTime="4496.942" offset="18091133">To declare that the Government may commit crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal would bring terrible retribution.</text>
