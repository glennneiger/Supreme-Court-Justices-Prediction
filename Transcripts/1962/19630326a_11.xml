            <label>Mr. Ephraim London</label>
            <text syncTime="36.169" offset="248038">Mr. Chief Justice, justices of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.072" offset="263711">This appeal is from an order of the Ohio Supreme Court, affirming the conviction of the appellant Jacobellis on two felony counts; one was the possession of a motion picture film that was said to be obscene, the name of the film was “The Lovers” and the other felony of which he was convicted was exhibiting the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.581" offset="377710">Jacobellis was the manager of a theater in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.017" offset="415431">He had nothing whatever to do with the selection of pictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.099" offset="443747">His function was running the theater physically, seeing to it that employees were present and projecting the film and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.094" offset="495783">The films were actually selected by the owner of the theater which by the way was one of the fairly large chains and the owner was a resident of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.744" offset="550327">I shouldn't describe the film itself, the film is in exhibit and I think --</text>

            <label>Justice Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="118.657" offset="578017">He of course reviewed the film before it was shown, as the manager of theater?</text>

          <turn speaker="ephraim_london" startTime="123.329" stopTime="205.976">
            <label>Mr. Ephraim London</label>
            <text syncTime="123.329" offset="596720">Yes, Your Honor, he knew the content of the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.327" offset="608632">He had shown it to some critics before he exhibited it.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.427" offset="629112">And he arranged for public exhibition and the point of fact, the police chief called up and asked about the film when he saw an ad for it, and Mr. Jacobellis said, “Come on and see it,” invited him to the first showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.665" offset="709987">The -- as I say, a sheriff described the film itself except to mention that particular objection seems to be taken by the State and by the Ohio Supreme Court to one sequence in the film which as a matter of fact is not within the range of a camera.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.925" offset="791071">It takes place off screen.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.168" offset="807999">One does not see what is happening but the State believes and offered witnesses to state that they felt that something that was pretty obscene was going on out of the camera range and I think, Your Honor, this is pretty much like saying that the photograph of an apartment house has a blurry picture because of what has going on behind the darkened windows.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.359" offset="936835">What is on screen is a woman, Your Honor, and you see her face and bare shoulders.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.642" offset="961912">She is lying in bed, and prior to that time, there has been a scene of love making between the woman and the man.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.305" offset="992632">You don't see any act of love but it's quite obvious that they are making love to each other or at least that they're in the bed for that purpose.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="234.259" offset="1040384">So this -- in your apartment house in our view is something of a euphemism?</text>

            <text syncTime="240.403" offset="1064939">I don't think the analogy is exact, but one must imagine what is going on and when what one cannot see in order to say that this particular sequence is obscene.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="253.024" offset="1115512">Was the advertising of it had anything to do with it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ephraim London</label>
            <text syncTime="256.250" offset="1128364">The advertising does in this respect that I think the State relies to a very large extent in order to show intent and knowledge of obscenity on in the advertisement that appeared in a newspaper.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="earl_warren" startTime="271.780" stopTime="273.201">
            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="271.780" offset="1190536">Who was responsible for that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ephraim_london" startTime="273.201" stopTime="382.465">
            <label>Mr. Ephraim London</label>
            <text syncTime="273.201" offset="1196178">The owner of the theater.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.708" offset="1202239">The ad is made up, sometimes mats are supplied.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.229" offset="1216240">The manager of the theater has nothing to do with the advertisement but he must place it in a local paper and of course in placing it, he can read the text of the advertisement and the advertisement in this case said that this was the most daring love story ever filmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.571" offset="1293667">However, I think the Court can take judicial notice of the fact that many advertisements color very highly, the content of the film or a book, and frequently exaggerate the sexual appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.291" offset="1356570">This is -- this is almost standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.548" offset="1365556">As a matter of fact, I remember when the guidance committee was conducting an investigation of pornography, one of their chief objections was to the deceptive nature of the covers of certain books which led one to believe that he was reading a lurid film or buying it, when as a matter of fact, what he was getting was a classic so that one could not really have been put on notice by the content of the advertisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.745" offset="1478301">I think it should be noted that this film has won two important international prizes.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.216" offset="1504214">One was the second prize at the Venice Film Festival where it got the Silver Lion Award, and then, and the first prize at a Brazilian Festival.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.299" offset="1548518">It was said to be one of the best 10 films of the year by Bosley Crowther, the film critic of the New York Times, also by Hollis Alpert and Arthur Knight of The Saturday Review of Literature and it was extremely well reviewed by the critic of the Herald Tribune who testified.</text>

            <text syncTime="2328.299" offset="9416600">With respect to the other appendices that the appellant takes objection to in his reply brief, may I point out that these appendices where before this Court previously in the brief supporting the motion to dismiss, and that these appendices are the subject of testimony of the several witnesses that appear in the transcript of the record that is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.419" offset="9521089">I think that they are properly before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2358.667" offset="9538017">Now, with regard to the factual situation in this case; the case in the first instance came on for a hearing by the Common Pleas Court by virtue of the fact that a grand jury had returned an indictment after viewing the movie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.182" offset="9608129">Under the Ohio law, the defendant was entitled to a trial by jury or a waiver of the same or in the discretion of the Court, a trial by a three-man court if application was made for such a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.042" offset="9659538">In this instance, an application was made for a trial before a three-man court and that motion was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.342" offset="9688691">The trial court viewed the movie as did the Court of Appeals, as did the Supreme Court ultimately in passing judgment on the question of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.857" offset="9726830">Under the Ohio law, it is not necessary that the Court, in rendering its verdict, set forth an opinion or a conclusion of law or a fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.561" offset="9761625">However, in this instance, the trial court did set forth an opinion which opinion almost in toto was reiterated by the Court of Appeals and by the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.819" offset="9810631">In that opinion, the Court will note that the trial court was cognizant of and did employ the standards set forth in the Roth case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.329" offset="9868727">Now, with respect to the movie itself; it was not contended by the State nor is it contended here that we object to one portion of the movie but rather that we object to the movie in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.803" offset="9930585">And as the Court did employ the standard set forth in the Roth case, we ask that the standards be set forth in the review in this particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.710" offset="9994219">In the movie, as the expert witnesses had testified, the fourth version -- portion of the movie was devoted to setting the stage as it were for the climax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.358" offset="10044792">And the climax was one wherein a young married woman, mother of a child for some reason or another, unhappy with her husband's failing to manifest any affection or attention toward her, she picked up with a relative stranger and after a brief dinner engagement in their home in this particular evening, and after she had retired for the evening, she went out into a garden on the front of the house dressed in a negligee, met this young man and they then proceeded to go for a ride in a boat in a lake in the immediate vicinity of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.151" offset="10223992">And in the boat, there was much arduous lovemaking after which the two returned to the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.023" offset="10255444">She returned to the upper portion of the house, she kissed her young daughter good night for the evening and then returned to her bedroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.480" offset="10297344">And the scene then shows the negligee being removed from the upper portion of her body and dropping to the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.183" offset="10328064">And then she in turn, removing the clothing of the young gentleman and these being dropped to the floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.135" offset="10363904">The scene then moves to the bedroom wherein the upper portion of her body is exposed as is his and the scene depicts him laying on top of this young lady engaged in arduous embrace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.057" offset="10431613">And after a period of this lovemaking, he then disappears and she is seen on the screen and as the expert witnesses testified, experiencing an orgasm and leaving no other inference but that the young man is then engaged in cunnilinguis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.531" offset="10525445">After this is completed, the young couple continued to spend the balance of the night sleeping together in the bed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2678.087" offset="10815718">The defense argues that the Mapp case which was before this Court, I might add that the Mapp case being before this Court was reversed for other reasons that of violating due process because of an unlawful, unreasonable search and seizure, but then in the Mapp case before the State of Ohio, the Court held that scienter was necessary and the defense contends that in that case, that culpable intent or mens rea was not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.039" offset="10967542">I argue that the Mapp case is distinguished from the present case and that in the Mapp case we were concerned with mere knowing possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.666" offset="11002023">And I might point out that in that case, that case did not preclude the application of the Ohio statute to an instance or into a fact situation wherein there is a possession for commercial purposes, a possession for exhibition as is the case in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.450" offset="11085197">Just -- Judge Herbert in that case pointed out specifically in his dissent that he would not have any court or whatever for the defendant if there was evidence of commercialization in that instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.479" offset="11137337">In the instant case, we find that the defendant had no inquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.061" offset="11159594">We find that he had exhibited the movie to critics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.574" offset="11177671">This by admission in the record that there had been three showings before the film was confiscated and the arrest was effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.327" offset="11212675">Further, the evidence showed that he had the benefit of reading the reviews local and otherwise that had pointed out at least with respect to the local reviews that are in the opinion of those reviewers, this movie was obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.190" offset="11276100">State versus Mapp did not foreclose the ban and possession for purposes of exhibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.239" offset="11304312">Mere possession as possibly was the case in the Mapp case, mere knowing possession might well be lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.646" offset="11337958">Certainly, it is not the intent of the law to hold unlawful the possession knowingly of obscene material by a prosecutor, a judge or a jury or a psychiatrist holding the same pretty lawful purpose namely to affect the prosecution there under.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.995" offset="11415385">In the Alberts versus California, this Court held that a state statute was constitutional for lewdly keeping for sale obscene materials, so I submit that much more so, the constitutionality of the Ohio statute should be upheld for it knowingly, or prohibits rather the knowing possession and control for exhibition of an obscene motion picture film.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.814" offset="11522591">I submit that a conviction there under for knowingly possessing and controlling the obscenity, for the purpose of exhibition and the actual exhibition is and should be a sustainable statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.672" offset="11582046">The prevailing and authorative interpretation of the Ohio statute is to be found in State versus Jacobellis and State versus Wetzel, 173 Ohio State and then in these two cases, the facts are specifically in point whereas in the Mapp case, the Mapp is generally in point.</text>

            <text syncTime="3547.583" offset="14293661">The facts of that case are these; that that statute in substance made a decline for one under the color of office or authority to willfully deny another his right of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.649" offset="14346010">The statute specifically provided for the element of willfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.089" offset="14363773">The Court in that case did not instruct the jury on the element of willfulness and on that basis alone, certainly, the -- the decision should have been reversed for due process was denied the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.068" offset="14427617">The Court, however, did point out that the term “willful” in that statute gave the statute more meaning, it made it more definitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.359" offset="14464815">So also, I contend that in the Ohio statute, when we have the word “knowingly” and then when the Court further requires as an inescapable part of the scienter, the element of mens rea, then I say that we have made the Ohio statute as definite as can be made in the attack that the same as vague should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.220" offset="14572231">I might point out that the contention is made that the trial court did not have in mind at the time that it rendered its decision, the element of mens rea.</text>

            <text syncTime="3895.495" offset="15685360">No, I won't subscribe to that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.402" offset="15692988">They have the facts of the Mapp case and the interpretation under those facts and how we've got different facts and interpreting under different facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.441" offset="15729142">They did not exclude mens rea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.232" offset="15740322">And in the Mapp case, I might point out that Justice Herbert specifically said that I would have no quarter or whatever for the defendant if there was evidence that this was a commercialization or a possession for commercial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.225" offset="15816286">In point two, the appellant argues and I must quickly move through this one that the statute should be void in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3937.186" offset="15852126">For the first time, now, we have the entire statute being the subject of concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="3944.625" offset="15881906">I submit that this was not properly raised in the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.524" offset="15897475">It was not before the lower courts, and in general, may I say that the rule of law that the Court -- the constitutionality of the statute should not be tested and the abstract should be employed in this particular instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.589" offset="15969677">Only the legal rights of the litigant should be adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.658" offset="15985977">However, out of an abundance of caution, I'll point up that the appellant contends that in this case there are exceptions that are applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.233" offset="16024325">He points out for example that the statute is unconstitutional in a majority of its intended applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.132" offset="16055881">He then speculates and engages in conjecture and says that the statute has already been declared unconstitutional in the vast majority of its intended application.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.213" offset="16104260">This statute, I submit, has not been found unconstitutional in any application.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.136" offset="16135920">He goes down to say that where the statute would have an inhibitory effect on expression that then the Court should look into the statute in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="4018.344" offset="16176776">And he cites to support this position, the Smith case, the Smith case is distinguished by virtue of the fact that it lacks scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="4025.806" offset="16206555">We have scienter in this instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.920" offset="16215019">He cites the Thornhill case, this case is distinguished because the framing in that instance against the defendant was generally and not specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="4038.908" offset="16259009">In conclusion, may I ask the Court to consider the constitutionality of this statute in light of the facts in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.087" offset="16291715">Thank you.</text>
