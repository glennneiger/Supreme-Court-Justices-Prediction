            <text syncTime="16.419" offset="171092">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.064" offset="181645">This case is here on an appeal from the decision of a three-judge District Court that held Pennsylvania's Bible-reading statute being unconstitutional establishment of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.999" offset="241413">Now, this case is different from the case you have just heard because in Pennsylvania, the Bible-reading statute does not require that the Lord's Prayer be said, it has nothing to do with the Lord's Prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.118" offset="305883">It is the practice at Abington Township during the morning exercises to follow the statutory Bible reading with the recitation of the Lord's Prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.936" offset="357188">However, that is not the practice in all of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.399" offset="375056">The decree that has enjoined Abington in this case and the court below found it was unconstitutional either to read the 10 verses of the Bible pursuant to Pennsylvania statute either alone or in conjunction with the recitation of the Lord's Prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.227" offset="462305">Consequently, the basic issue in my case is a constitutionality of reading 10 verses of the Bible without comment to the school children of Pennsylvania, or if the Court finds that that practice is unconstitutional, it need not concern itself with the Lord's Prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.372" offset="546941">And if it finds that practice is constitutional, the reading of the 10 verses, but that following it with the recitation of the Lord's Prayer effects the constitutionality of the Bible reading then of course it could frame a decree accordingly.</text>

            <text syncTime="203.681" offset="920179">That question never arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.148" offset="933972">We shall argue that the religious liberties of the Schempp's who were the appellees -- the plaintiffs in this case are not infringed that this case doesn't concern the establishment of religion within the meaning of the Constitution and that there is no requirement that Pennsylvania must give up an ancient custom simply because it involves the use of the Bible.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.035" offset="1049537">Now, this litigation started five years ago when the original complaint was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.826" offset="1076705">At that time, the Bible-reading statute of Pennsylvania provided that 10 verses of the Holy Bible had to be read at the opening of each school day, provided it will be read by the teacher in charge and it further provided that in the event the teacher refused to participate, he could be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.943" offset="1165208">The complaint filed by the Schempp's under that statute said that the practice at Abington, reading the Bible according to the statute following it with the recitation of the Lord's Prayer, violated their religious consciences and liberties, interfered with the rights of the parents to raise their children and the method of their own belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.460" offset="1259248">And also practiced -- the practice fostered contradictory beliefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.666" offset="1284117">They sought an injunction against the reading of the Bible following by the Lord's Prayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.165" offset="1314105">Now, there was a trial held and we have a record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.958" offset="1325286">The trial was held and the three Schempp children, Roger, Ellory and Donna, testified that they had been compelled to attend Bible reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.044" offset="1373560">They testified that many passages from the Bible read to them, confused them, aggrieved them, and taught some things which was contrary to their belief at home.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.749" offset="1552447">We had the testimony of the two experts, who testified concerning the Bible pretty much as Your Honors would expect that the Bible is a great document.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.208" offset="1594243">It's an old document.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.684" offset="1600199">It comes from certain basic original sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.620" offset="1615872">That it is a religious document in the sense that it has moral literary value that Dr. Grayzel, who was an eminent Jewish Theologian, testified that all of the New Testament and parts of the Old Testament would be -- would offend the belief of the Jews.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.754" offset="1704479">As a result of that trial, the lower court, the three-judge court found that the practice of reading the Bible pursuant to the old compulsory statute, followed by the saying of the Lord's Prayer, amounted to an establishment of religion because it said the Bible deals with man's relationship to God.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.940" offset="1793191">That this daily reading is a daily reminder of that relationship and this daily reading indoctrinates the children and that consequently also the parent's rights were abridged.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.206" offset="1850243">It said it violates free exercise and that Ellory and the children were forced to attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.374" offset="1878873">And then it said, since the teachers had to read under pain of dismissal, they would try to get a large audience for the Bible reading to hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.982" offset="1925371">The main point, the main thrust --</text>

            <text syncTime="458.528" offset="1939581">We -- you recall under the statute as it then stood, it required that the teacher in charge reading the Bible or cause it to be read and any teacher who refused to participate could be disciplined and expelled.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.968" offset="1997260">Therefore, in the lower court decision, in the first case which was the trial under that particular compulsory statute which contained that provision, the judge said that since a teacher knows that he may be expelled or may be dismissed, it's -- to his advantage to assemble -- convince the children to listen.</text>

            <text syncTime="581.207" offset="2430265">But the essential part of the lower courts decision in the first compulsory statute was -- as I understand the compulsion that every child had to attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.532" offset="2475510">In other words, it was a concern then to what reading a certain passage from the Bible might be on a Jewish child's mind, but he knew a Jewish child had to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.325" offset="2514693">And as a matter of fact, the eighth finding of fact of the first decision which is at page 194 of the record, was that as a matter of fact, the children had to be present and that they were compelled to be present at the Bible reading ceremony.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.990" offset="2573416">So the decree held that, the first decree held that we could not read the Bible pursuant to the statute or otherwise except that we always can use any book, this decree said.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.001" offset="2629423">We can use any book we want in the schools of Abington as a reference or as a source, as a material for study.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.619" offset="2671846">In other words, they weren't banning the Bible per se from Abington.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.752" offset="2688460">They mentioned nothing of the Lord's Prayer in the first decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.536" offset="2703611">Following this decree, we immediately found notice of appeal with this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.973" offset="2729315">Prior to the time, our jurisdictional statement was filed with this Court, the legislature of Pennsylvania amended the Bible Reading Act to provide that any child could be excused from the Bible reading, from participating or being there upon a written request of his parent or guardian and also eliminated from the statute, that particular language about the teacher having to be enthusiastic as Mr. Justice Harlan said, that was stricken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.080" offset="2877691">We -- this Court then, the Supreme Court, they catered the judgment and remanded our case back to the three-judge District Court for further action appropriate in light of the amendment to the Bible-reading statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.190" offset="2958148">Thereafter, the three-judge court allowed the Schempps to amend their complaint by eliminating the name of Ellory, who had been graduating and by simply substituting the new statute.</text>
