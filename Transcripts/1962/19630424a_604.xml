            <label>Mr. Bernard Dunau</label>
            <text syncTime="33.162" offset="236022">May it please the Court?</text>
            <text syncTime="35.690" offset="246157">A Missouri statute known as the King-Thomson Act provides that when the Governor of the state determines that an actual or threatened strike by a union against the utility jeopardizes the public interest, health and welfare, the Governor is authorized to take possession of the utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.523" offset="357439">If the utility is taken over, the statute makes unlawful any strike to enforce demands against the utility or against the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.489" offset="413341">Our principle question is whether the King-Thompson Act, which prohibits a strike to enforce demands during seizure is in conflict with and therefore preempted by the Labor Management Relations Act, which protects the right to strike and to bargain collectively, of which the right to strike is an indispensable part.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.493" offset="513337">Now our question arises in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.205" offset="532146">The utility here is the Kansas City Transit, Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.369" offset="548864">It's an interstate enterprise, which transports passengers by bus in and between the states of Kansas and Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.027" offset="591496">In 1943, the National Labor Relations Board certified the appellant union as the bargaining representative of bus drivers, mechanics and others who worked for the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.829" offset="638725">Since 1943 collective bargaining agreements have been entered into between the utility and the union governing the employment terms of these persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.408" offset="688985">A collective bargaining agreement was due to expire on October 31, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.115" offset="715839">Negotiations began in the Fall of that year looking towards improved contract terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.903" offset="739035">An impasse ensued.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.405" offset="744991">The deadlock was over wages, paid vacations, group insurance and other such bread and butter issues. Unable to resolve the deadlock, and the company refusing to agree to voluntary arbitration of new contract terms, the men voted to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.316" offset="824613">The strike was to begin at midnight November 13,, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.986" offset="847287">Three days before the strike was to begin the union notified all concerned of the time it would start.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.455" offset="877171">On November 13th the same day that the strike was to begin, the Governor of Missouri issued a proclamation in which he stated that the threatened strike would jeopardize the public interest, health and welfare and he was there for taking over the utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.170" offset="956061">Taking over the utility meant no more than that the agent of the Governor deliver to the President of the company this proclamation and two, implementing executive orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.034" offset="1007470">Nothing changed as a consequence of the takeover.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.782" offset="1022516">The employees remained as they were employees of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.218" offset="1036204">They did not become employees of the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="243.098" offset="1075806">As a matter of fact, the one change, which took place was that by operation of law the strike was prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.866" offset="1106840">As a matter of fact nothing changed other than to prohibit that strike.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.704" offset="1226167">It does not in anyway detail what constitutes possession or what the Governor might do if he took possession.

            <text syncTime="336.518" offset="1449462">This is quite independent of what would happen if you had a true civil service situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.678" offset="1470046">This is a situation in which a private utility employing private employees is taken over by what I call a paper possession in which nothing happens except by virtue of the statute the right to strike is forbidden during the period of seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.222" offset="1536293">The company continues to operate as it has done before completely on it's own.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.824" offset="1562624">The officers and the Board of Directors make their own decisions, the state has nothing to do with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.642" offset="1585925">What happens and all that happens is that seizure means that you cannot strike during the period of seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.356" offset="1620825">The men nevertheless struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.437" offset="1629080">They struck for two days.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.713" offset="1634200">The strike was peaceful and the picketing was peaceful.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.015" offset="1647470">At the end of the two days as a result of the issuance of a temporary restraining order which eventuated into a permanent injunction against the strike, the strike was discontinued.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.377" offset="1696893">Now if this were a strike by bakers or miners or autoworkers there would be no doubt under the sun that the state could not enter such an injunction, this would be activity protected by the Federal Act and no state can prohibit what the Federal Act protects.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.616" offset="1785814">And so it seems to us that what this case comes down to --</text>

            <text syncTime="430.262" offset="1824371">I am not prepared to say that the word, a strike by genuine state employees that the state could not prohibit a strike by state employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.283" offset="1852479">The Federal Government prohibits a strike by federal employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.983" offset="1863346">I think there would be no substantial question that the state could prohibit a strike by state employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="449.200" offset="1900126">In the case of true governmental ownership and operation this -- the labor relations would be outside the scope of the Taft-Hartley Act, and we would have no problem, but a constitutional problem and very little of a constitutional problem I should think.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.788" offset="1958536">As I was saying, if this were a strike by bankers, miners, autoworkers, it wouldn't be the slightest doubt that the state couldn't prohibit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.806" offset="2010572">And so it seems to us that our question comes down to, does it make a difference that instead of just being a strike of bankers, autoworkers or miners, it is a strike of bus drivers and mechanics working for a transit company.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.550" offset="2077550">And it seems to us that this Court answered that question 12 years ago in Amalgamated Association versus the Wisconsin Employment Relations Board, when this Court said, that public utility workers just like any other class of workers covered by the Federal Act enjoy all the protections of the Federal Act and the state cannot do anything to prohibit that which the Federal Act protects.</text>

            <text syncTime="642.106" offset="2671783">The other part comes into play as a consequence of the state's argument that this is not a comprehensive statute and for that reason it's different from the Wisconsin Act, which this Court invalidated 12 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.388" offset="2736880">To that argument we have two answers, first we can't see for the life of us, why it makes a difference, whether it's comprehensive or cursory.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.193" offset="2768123">All that it has to be is in conflict with the Federal Act and if it's in conflict it's superseded whether it's short or long.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.551" offset="2801560">Now our other point is that in our appendix to our brief this non-comprehensive statute runs to eleven-and-a-half -- ten-and-a-half pages, I don't know what Missouri tell us when it writes a comprehensive statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.123" offset="2863835">This non-comprehensive statute covers every aspect of the government of the regulation of a labor dispute in public utilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="710.087" offset="2943770">And I think that there can be a little doubt that while the state -- the Federal statute certainly contemplates that states may participate in mediation efforts, I think it contemplates that it will participate in mediation efforts consistently with the standards of the Federal Act and not in conflict with them.</text>

            <text syncTime="782.451" offset="3233207">There was a watchdog committee setup in the Taft-Hartley Act to take a look at the administration of the Taft-Hartley Act for one year after it was enacted in 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.781" offset="3286497">One of the things that this watchdog committee spoke about was a recommendation that there ought to be an amendment to Taft-Hartley to authorize Boards of Inquiry to make recommendations instead of simply finding the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.342" offset="3348773">This watchdog committee then said as to that suggestion, a further suggestion has been made that the emergency board be permitted to make recommendations as well as find the facts in these disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.972" offset="3403212">That alternative to the act's procedures was considered at length by the committees who drafted the act and rejected by them as being in fact compulsory arbitration with public opinion providing the compulsion.</text>
