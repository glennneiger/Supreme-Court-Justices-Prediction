            <text syncTime="5.945" offset="127143">Mr. Miles, you may continue with your argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Raymond T. Miles</label>
            <text syncTime="8.314" offset="136652">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.595" offset="149713">Yesterday, at the conclusion of the session, I had pointed out how we, representing the trustee in bankruptcy were favored by three decisions of recent vintage including the decision of this Court, United States against the Munsey Trust Company decided in 1947, and the decisions of two Circuit Courts which clearly favor us.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.510" offset="237380">One of the being an all force with the case before Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.084" offset="255666">I had also pointed out that time that the surety here claimed support from two cases of this Court, one decided 1896, the Prairie State National Bank against United States and the other, the case of Henningsen against United States Fidelity and Guarantee Company decided in 1907.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.665" offset="325987">I'll repeat what I said yesterday that we have no quarrel whatsoever with the case of Prairie State against National Bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.900" offset="354931">I've also pointed out I believe that there is an attack being made directly here on the Henningsen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.909" offset="399026">Now we've shown how the courts have wandered around in an effort to sustain the results which have favored the surety in these cases which of course preceded the case as which we cite are supporting us since 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.331" offset="448658">Now, it would seem to me that it might be interesting to look to the position of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.019" offset="471437">The Government, under the standard contract that it had in this case and it has in all of these types of cases, has a provision that the contracting officer is under no obligation to see that the laborers and the materialmen are paid, the suppliers and the materialmen are paid where 50% of the contract has been performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.223" offset="548237">We think that this is indicative of the fact that either the Government has concluded there is no equitable obligation upon the Government to see that they are paid or that it is the Government's thought that the equitable obligation has been satisfied by the passage of the Miller Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.306" offset="616573">Now, it might also be of some interest to look to the statements made in the Congress at the time that this Act was before the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.159" offset="660041">I think it's clearly stated there that the passage of the Miller Act served two purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.483" offset="685328">The performance bond was to satisfy the obligation to the Government and the passage of the provision regarding the payment bond was to satisfy any obligation or any duty, call it what you will, to the suppliers and the materialmen.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.109" offset="819806">I've never seen a statement made to that effect, but I would conclude that it would not have such a right because the materialmen have no enforceable rights directly against the Government.</text>

            <text syncTime="275.551" offset="1205582">And finally, I know that there's been a great deal set about various equities here and we'd like to point out the fact that there are certain equities held by the trustee in bankruptcy in some of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.000" offset="1247378">And this has been notably apparent in the fact that you now have two amicus curiae, who represent trustees in bankruptcy who are presenting briefs to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.792" offset="1290533">One of them has already presented a brief to this Court and another one will shortly present a brief to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.745" offset="1310386">Both of those gentlemen represent trustees in bankruptcy who have gone ahead and performed the contract, completed the contract with the funds of the bankrupt, that is the general assets of the bankrupt, and if the decision of this Court is that under the circumstances are paid for by the surety, if the surety is successful then I take it that the trustees in bankruptcy will be foreclosed from recovering any of the retainages presently held by the Government in those particular cases and will have the anomalous situation that the trustee who did the work did not recover any of the retainages, but the surety who didn't do the work and didn't complete the job did recover the retainages.</text>

            <text syncTime="449.115" offset="1899813">And then apparently in an effort to sustain the decision which seemingly had been made on the basis of the voluntariness or the lack of voluntariness of these particular parties went ahead and said that the Government had equitable obligation even though it had no legal obligation.</text>

            <text syncTime="528.117" offset="2215790">If the Court please, at the outset I would like to discuss very briefly some of the matters which I feel are landmarks, so to speak, which we feel the Court in the Hinds and Earle cases overlooked or misconceived.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.801" offset="2306591">In the first place, I would like to repeat and emphasize that the respondent surety here has paid all of the job creditors on this job.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.711" offset="2370226">And the stipulation further provides that there are no known unpaid job creditors, so that the other creditors who are in the picture here have claims entirely unrelated to this St. Lawrence Seaway job which the Reliance Insurance Company bonded.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.385" offset="2476910">Secondly, I would like to reemphasize the fact that the payment and performance bonds here as in all contract surety cases is not any form of insurance or protection to the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.298" offset="2560606">The contractor is and remains to -- remains the principle obligor or debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.478" offset="2593311">It is his first obligation to pay his debts and complete the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.722" offset="2622255">A surety stands secondarily liable only, true as to a creditor, a surety is liable equally with the contractor but as between themselves, the surety is secondarily liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.908" offset="2710967">And following that, if a surety pays or discharges an obligation of the principle, the surety is entitled so far as may be possible to be made whole by the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.340" offset="2796753">Now, the trustee in this situation represents or stands in the shoes of the contractor.</text>

            <text syncTime="706.504" offset="2929351">One other matter is this, that the payment and performance bond, and we are dealing here primarily with a payment bond, is an undertaking by the surety and the principle in favor of the United States, but for the benefit of a selected group of the contractor's creditors, not his general creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.703" offset="3046170">It is an obligation confined by its terms to the suppliers, the laborers and materialmen on that particular job.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.341" offset="3100714">Mr. Miles the other day made a remark that there were some general creditors whose claims antedated the making of this contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="765.125" offset="3163826">However, I feel that is of little or no moment because we are agreeing that there are no unpaid job creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.856" offset="3214817">One other matter and that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.340" offset="3236760">It is our position to what -- that whatever rights the laborers and materialmen had under the common-law are not cut down or limited by the furnishing of this bond or these bonds that like the mechanic's lien laws in most -- it's not all of the states, those remedies are supplemental remedies and merely because there is a bond present in the case, should not be similar and tend to diminish or cut down the laborer and materialmen's rights in a situation merely because there is a bond.</text>

            <text syncTime="959.597" offset="3941752">And in the Westinghouse case decided by this Court, there we had a situation where the amount of the undertaking by the surety was insufficient to pay all of the job creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.431" offset="4009148">The surety paid the full amount of its penalty -- of the penalty of its bond and then sought to share in the bankrupt estate pro-rata along with the other unpaid creditors, but there were unpaid job creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.321" offset="4060662">And this Court, very properly, it seems to me, said to the surety, “You must stand aside until all the job creditors are paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.055" offset="4091591">This fund is for their primary protection.”</text>
            <text syncTime="999.798" offset="4102562">And there, I submit is a shining example of how the Court, sitting as a court of equity reaches through and protects those who are entitled to the proceeds of the, of the contract moneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.682" offset="4178108">Also, in the -- in the Samson case, the Court did the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.424" offset="4229099">And in the Martin case, the surety had an assignment but became bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.701" offset="4262222">He filed the assignment and said it was for the benefit of the job creditors as this Court had no hesitancy in allocating to the job creditors the proceeds of the job money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.146" offset="4327946">Our opponents concede that if the surety in this case paid out its money in physically completing the job, we would be entitled to the contract moneys assuming there are loss equaled or exceeded the balance on hand.</text>

            <text syncTime="1190.678" offset="4866069">And if the claims of the Government exhausted the penalty to bond, the laborers and materialmen took nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.021" offset="4891460">Under the -- under the Miller Act, there are two separate bonds, one running to the Government with respect to -- to performance or completion, the other one in favor of the laborers and materialmen only for their protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.681" offset="4958124">I would like to reemphasize that basically, I see no difference between a payment and a performance bond, so far as the rights of the surety are concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1342.725" offset="5474304">The bond itself was both a performance and payment bond, but the question issued related to the surety's payment of labor and material bills as distinguished from physical completion of the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.145" offset="5547969">With respect to the -- to the rights of the -- of the surety here, there have been announced three general avenues of recovery; one, by subrogation to the rights of the owner or the Government to see to it that the laborers and materialmen are paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.595" offset="5645772">The rationale of those cases is -- is to this effect that by requiring the contractor to furnish a labor and material bond, the Government had expressed its interest and moral obligation to see to it that the laborers and materialmen were paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.510" offset="5749426">And that stemming from that moral obligation, they had a right, so to speak, to use those funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.864" offset="5778787">And in that connection, we have cited the McKinley case, the Martin case, the Westinghouse case, and the Samson case as indicating that when the chips are down, so to speak, and there is no other source of recovery, by one means or another, the Government and the courts have seen to it that what we maintain is the Government's moral obligation to see that laborer and materialmen claimed to have paid has been accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.366" offset="5896861">So that while -- while it is true, no laborer has a right to file a lien on a federal judge or to sue the Government, still no, there are equitable obligations existing there which under the proper setting or in a proper setting are given expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.501" offset="5977422">And there's one very, very interesting case, the New York Insurance Company case which illustrates rather neatly actually, it's the Court of Claims case, the direct rights of the surety to the fund that was a case where the Government had no interest of its own to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.215" offset="6064253">It had no claims either for -- for the completion of the job or any of that sort, A surety had paid substantial claims under its payment bond and had notified the contracting officer of the existence of its claim or that it had -- had paid all these claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="1654.071" offset="6719613">We have cited some cases on page 11 of our brief -- well, those are bankruptcy cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.085" offset="6771754">On page -- on page 21, those largely come up on the -- on the second branch up to the matter I was -- as to, as to the trustee's lack of property to which he could succeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.100" offset="6835806">They've -- they come up in a slightly different way because there are often times, there are a mechanic's lien statutes, and I refer particularly to the Aquilino case and the Durham Lumber Company case decided by this Court not too long ago where in a non-federal contract matter, the Court said if the -- if the laws of the state under which the matter arose, provided as to the -- as to the bankrupts lack of interest, that would be respected by this -- by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.916" offset="6999019">And in that setting, we do have a number of cases which we have -- have cited on page 21 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.528" offset="7045517">The second ground of -- of the surety's rights is subrogation to the rights of the laborers and materialmen and that is the basis adopted by the District Court and the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.714" offset="7106226">And there again, it springs basically from the same general situation that the contract funds, arising from the performance of the contract are in the nature of trust funds dedicated to the payment of labor and materialmen's claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.803" offset="7186578">Now in many of the, in many of the states, we do have the statutory lien provisions constituting trust -- constituting contract moneys as trust funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.571" offset="7229628">And here at this point, I would like to allude to my adversary's comment that there is no reece, there is no trust fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.923" offset="7271111">I submit there is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.647" offset="7281977">In our case, we have $87,000 in the hands of the -- of the trustee through until the actual money is segregated and paid out by the -- by the Comptroller or the United States Treasury, it is in a mess but when the question comes up for decision as it is here, the fund is segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.572" offset="7365674">We know that these funds arose from the -- from the performance by the contract of the physical work and his failure to pay for it, and the surety's payment for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.009" offset="7411440">And through this -- throughout -- throughout these cases is the -- is the all pervasive idea of the courts, some adopting one theory, some adopting another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.552" offset="7461595">Here are, are contract funds which should be dedicated as though they were in formal trust funds to the beneficiaries who produced the improvement, the subcontractors, the laborers and materialmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.714" offset="7514258">And when the Surety Company discharges those obligations, it is entitled to stand in their shoes and assert there equitable liens are priorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.112" offset="7555845">The third ground is assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.318" offset="7572668">In this case, prior to -- prior to the giving of the bond, the surety -- the contractor execute an assignment of his rights to the surety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.894" offset="7618957">All contract moneys in the event of his default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.660" offset="7634004">We urge that also as a ground of relief and it's interesting to note that this Court in the Martin against National Surety Company case; selected that ground as the basis for distributing the fund to laborers and materialmen and then the surety was insolvent, but the Court took it upon itself to divide that fund among the job creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.226" offset="7724283">And in the Munsey Trust case, which we've cited, the 1947 case, it's interesting to note that footnote one of the Court's opinion in that case said that where the rights of the Government by way of set-off, which was the Munsey case, are not involved, the assignment is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.611" offset="7817801">So that our feeling here is, will the Government having no interest in this fund, no claim for taxes or any other claim that Martin against the National Surety Company is a valid subsisting authority for the support of -- of the -- of the respondent's position here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2090.792" offset="8466578">The trustee here has not expended $1 of the general assets of the bankrupt to complete this contract or to pay the bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.588" offset="8529690">Whatever payments have been made by the surety here did not deplete the bankruptcy state one iota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.971" offset="8567306">The trustee used none of the general assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.805" offset="8582562">Now that was present in some of the cases, but here, there was not one iota of general assets used by the trustee in completing the job or paying expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.932" offset="8635120">So we say as a matter of equity, bearing in mind that the fundamental rights between these parties to this appeal are in favor of the surety against the contractor, who's represented here by the trustee that the equities run in favor of the respondent against the trustee and that he should not step in here and seek what in effect is a windfall, and share in a fund to the building up of which he contributed, little or nothing, nothing, so far as the general assets of the state are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.851" offset="8794781">One remark about the Hinds case, in our view of the case, the Court overlooked some of these fundamental equities and treated the case on a purely legalistic theory which as I read it here that in as much as a laborer or materialmen on a federal job had no legal or enforceable rights in the ordinary sense of the term against the Government or relating to the contract moneys that therefore, the payment surety in paying these claims were subrogated to no legal, enforceable right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2215.590" offset="8965726">Now that is not our concept of the law that is applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.861" offset="8986833">We are dealing throughout here it seems to me, in the field of equity what is fair and right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.157" offset="9015986">We respectfully ask that the order of the Circuit Court be affirmed.</text>
