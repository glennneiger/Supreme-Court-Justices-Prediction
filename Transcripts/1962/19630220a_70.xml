            <text syncTime="44.098" offset="279803">Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.204" offset="292237">This case is here on certiorari to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to review two companion cases, which were argued below and decided together in November 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.726" offset="342288">Now both cases arise out of proceedings for the reorganization of the corporation under Chapter 10 of the Bankruptcy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.882" offset="378859">The Veteran reorganization is Nazareth Fairgrounds and Farmers' Market, Inc, a Pennsylvania Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.975" offset="411251">The proceedings began in September 1953, when the debtor filed a voluntary petition for reorganization in the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.521" offset="449494">The petition was approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.520" offset="457435">No trustee was appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.212" offset="464227">The debtor was continued in possession under his former management and the proceedings were referred to Judge Sugarman of the District Court and Judge Sugarman has tried all the matters that are before the Court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.122" offset="535907">Now the first case designated No. 27000 in the Court of Appeal, presents an Erie v. Tompkins question to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.717" offset="578226">In this case, the Court has non-diversity jurisdiction and this is the wrinkle in the Erie situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.755" offset="606438">The Rules of Decision Act provides that a Federal Court in any civil action apply state rules of decision, except where a Federal Statute or a Federal Policy supervenes.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.491" offset="657324">We submit that in this case on the substantive questions in No. 27000, there is no Federal Statute and no Federal Policy that even touches those substantive matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="157.496" offset="733393">Now there is no plan of reorganization pending, there is no creditor problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.880" offset="754918">In this case, the debtor is solvent in the bankruptcy sense; its assets have exceeded his liabilities from the day this petition was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.899" offset="786996">There is no question of priority among the stockholders; there is a single class of common stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.847" offset="810715">The problem really is that there was an over issue of stock in 1953, before the reorganization began.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.351" offset="840808">The articles of incorporation authorize an issuance of 200 shares and the man who ran this show before the reorganization, issued 316 at least.</text>

            <text syncTime="207.236" offset="932342">There is no question of jurisdiction Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.109" offset="943835">The question is, what rules of decision does the Bankruptcy Court, this Federal Court, regardless of jurisdiction use to decide who those stockholders are.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.449" offset="989184">In effect, it's my contention, the petitioners submit, that it's a matter of pure accident of fortuity that the case is in the Bankruptcy Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.131" offset="1023875">It's a matter of convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.496" offset="1029308">It was a happy accident that the debtor filed a petition, which stated in paragraph one, your petitioner is insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.177" offset="1060028">This was voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.598" offset="1065775">On ex parte orders, the petition was approved and the debtor was continued in possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.300" offset="1088554">The great advantage was at that point that under Section 196 of Chapter 10, Judge Sugarman issued these bar orders, which said, “All stockholders are to file proofs of claim.”</text>
            <text syncTime="258.918" offset="1139022">At this point, there was no problem of getting all the stockholders in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania into a single forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.093" offset="1167757">This was the great convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.008" offset="1175385">So, everybody came into the one forum in New York, the Southern District in a reorganization proceeding and then, we had a single lawsuit to determine this, but none of this has anything to do with the substantive law to be applied for all the difference it made for all these people had been residents of New York or one state.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.655" offset="1253961">It would have wound up in a State Court, because you could have got personal service and jurisdiction of the subject matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.972" offset="1279248">Now petitioner submits it shouldn't make a bit of difference whether you are in a Federal Court on diversity grounds or on non-diversity grounds or in a State Court, New York or Pennsylvania as to what law governs to decide who these stockholders are.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.359" offset="1388857">The bankruptcy law essentially and this goes to the reorganization too, it's a matter of protecting unsecured creditors who have no interest in the estate.</text>

            <text syncTime="539.704" offset="2262183">Now if in this case anyone can show any federal interest under the Bankruptcy Act or any other statute or any other policy that bears on this question of stock ownership that's the end of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.457" offset="2609194">And then they stopped there and what you'll find in Judge Moore's opinion in the Court of Appeals is no reference to the underlying statutes and no reference to the Pennsylvania Case Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.761" offset="2650467">Now this I say is in the very teeth of Erie, that under the Erie decision and perhaps even under Swift versus Tyson.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.862" offset="2682859">The whole point was that State Laws differ and that if you have to make an interpretation of State Law, you look to what the Local Court, in this case, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court says this law means.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.004" offset="2735417">Now what Judge Moore did was to disregard completely the statutes and the case law in Pennsylvania and then he went far beyond that not simply -- he disregarded the State Law as to voiding all of this stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.021" offset="2799470">And then, in establishing a remedy, which he called the matter of equity and this is all he called it, he said, “We'll do equity” in the broadest terms with no reference to any law, he then established a pattern of stock ownership, which had no reference whatever to Pennsylvania Law or New York Law, it's wrong and it's arbitrary we submit even as a matter of general equity under all Federal cases, but certainly you can't possibly justify it under Pennsylvania or New York Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.693" offset="2918170">And my point is that if the Rules of Decision Act says what it means, it means what it says.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.356" offset="2940844">In all civil actions the grounds of jurisdiction don't matter and this Court is not there just to do equity in the same old Swift versus Tyson sense of applying a general equity or a sort of Federal Common Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.703" offset="2998209">There is no federal interest here and they should have applied State Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.636" offset="3013883">It's not simply error in the interpretation and application of State Law, it's a total disregard of State Law.</text>

            <text syncTime="766.478" offset="3169259">This over issue of stock, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.642" offset="3177932">What he says is the Corporation did not receive any consideration for these shares that were outstanding, any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.899" offset="3206980">Now here he had to break it down into two pieces.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.677" offset="3218056">There have been 20 shares issued in 1951 capitalized at only $1500.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.518" offset="3245432">This I'll come to in a moment, but the point is, that even Judge More conceded that these 20 shares were valid and that there was consideration received for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.685" offset="3282108">Now all Judge Moore could say about the first 20 was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.414" offset="3297050">That the man is John Malakoff who sold everybody the stock in this Corporation, this man John Malakoff had never transferred the physical certificates, these two certificates for 10 shares each that were originally issued in August of 1951, endorsed over to him in blank in October of 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.326" offset="3380642">He never transferred those certificates until June of 1953, when he re-endorsed them and assigned them to the Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.487" offset="3413347">So Judge Moore said, first of all, that none of these 20 “Shares” came into the possession or into the hands of any of the stock claimants or stockholders, therefore, we can ignore them.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.387" offset="3468936">Now this is just wrong under the Uniform Stock Transfer Act of New York and Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.048" offset="3491610">It's the share certificates that didn't come into anybody's hand, not the shares and there is a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.237" offset="3516270">When Malakoff surrendered these shares in June of 1953, he couldn't cut off any prior rights in those 20 shares that the stockholders had acquired two years before or the fact that they didn't get the certificates as inconclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.015" offset="3575411">The only other person -- the Corporation received the certificates, and the Corporation was in no position to cut off rights of prior stockholders, especially when it had notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.779" offset="3618461">This is on the 20 shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.668" offset="3626088">Then on the other 180 shares within the authorized issue, Judge Moore said, the Corporation didn't receive consideration, because it didn't get the consideration directly from these 36 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.811" offset="3678647">Every one of them paid John Malakoff, not a single check went to Nazareth Fairgrounds, to the Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.546" offset="3701530">But what the Corporation got as Judge Moore recognized was this piece of valuable real estate, which is what all these people are carrying on about.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.563" offset="3733608">Now they have the real estate, so Judge Moore said, the real estate was not paid for -- he puts it in two ways, let me try to express it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.981" offset="3775300">He says, “These people didn't pay the Corporation therefore, the corporation didn't receive consideration and therefore, all the stock is void.”</text>
            <text syncTime="925.795" offset="3806542">Then he says, “However, we are in a position to award stock to these people who are entitled to it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="931.688" offset="3830157">We have to do it under the Pennsylvania Law and there must be consideration for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.796" offset="3846562">There is consideration, because the corporation received the valuable piece of real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.569" offset="3865684">This real estate was paid for by John Malakoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.579" offset="3877700">Therefore, we can give these people the stock backed by the real estate paid for by John Malakoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.015" offset="3903404">What Judge Moore has said is, that the real estate is consideration for new stock under a plan of reorganization, but the same real estate paid for by the same man is not consideration for the old stock that he issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.208" offset="3956172">Well to me, it makes no sense and he is wrong, but even assuming that and putting that aside that's the factual premise that the stock is void for lack of consideration or fact of law, then we get to these questions of Pennsylvania Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.575" offset="4017716">First of all, the Pennsylvania Law is different from New York and probably most other states, but certainly from New York in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.200" offset="4052198">There is a distinctive pattern set out by statute, which says “If a subscription is unpaid, if the Corporation hasn't received stock, sure the stock is void ultimately.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.121" offset="4103816">But the statutes and the Courts of Pennsylvania say, before you void the stock, you have to make a call or an assessment on these stockholders and give them, in this case, the opportunity to pay that price and until they have been given what amounts to a right of redemption, you don't force it to stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.207" offset="4184168">Now in New York it's different, you make a call there are 60 days, if you don't pay in that time, the stock is forfeited; even if demand to pay 90% of the stock subscription price before that time, the Corporation could just forfeit this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.768" offset="4242474">Pennsylvania is a lot more solicitous to these minority stockholders and in Pennsylvania; you must have the assessment first.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.529" offset="4293465">Moreover, under Pennsylvania Law, the burden of proof is on the debtor -- is on the Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.296" offset="4316557">If they say the stock hasn't been paid for, they've got to prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.153" offset="4332022">They have to make an assessment and say, you owe or whatever it is a $100 or $1000 on this stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.047" offset="4355532">Now there are two alternative provisions that the Corporation can follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.773" offset="4374444">In this case, the Corporation elected to follow one and they used the Bankruptcy Court the same as the any other Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.451" offset="4397223">They sued for a money judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.963" offset="4403179">They put it in the alternative backwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.185" offset="4412061">First, they asked for cancellation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.773" offset="4418435">They said in the alternative give us the subscription price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.161" offset="4432018">It doesn't matter, they asked for the subscription price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.087" offset="4443721">They had every opportunity to establish how much money was due on this stock and to get a money judgment that they asked for against these stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.889" offset="4478934">And what happened was, in the District Court Judge Sugarman said, “No dice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.432" offset="4497115">I won't cancel any of the stock and I also won't assess any unpaid subscription against these people.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.884" offset="4518954">At this point, the debtor abandoned anything further where the money judgment was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.339" offset="4540688">There was no proof that any of this money was unpaid and the market wouldn't support whatever the numbers of shares was that was outstanding, this is the second error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.144" offset="4575901">What Judge Moore said in the Court of Appeals was that “We will cancel the stock.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.394" offset="4596903">He had to begin by saying “All the stock is void.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.082" offset="4607666">There is no earmarking of a lack of consideration, no proof if there was any.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.898" offset="4622921">Now the most -- to me, the most vivid testimony to the fact that it's all wrong is that both my adversaries have conceded that the stock was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.362" offset="4656776">They don't know and they don't even presume to care how many stock or shares of stock were valid and how many weren't.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.848" offset="4682794">All they admit is that Judge Moore was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.123" offset="4695855">At least 20 shares of stock were valid, consideration was paid, their outstanding in somebody hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.811" offset="4722604">At this point, I say the debtor is out of it and the debtor Corporation has no remedy anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.233" offset="4748309">They have got no right to a money judgment, they've disclaimed it, they never appealed, so the Res Judicata thing would bar them, there is no proof, let alone the burden of proof, there is just no proof of assessment, they are out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.655" offset="4793971">Now we have a contest among 36 people as to who owns whatever the number of shares is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1232.064" offset="5031581">Well, what Judge Sugarman did was to change this index of participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.029" offset="5051538">What I'm saying is, all these people, each one made a deal with John Malakoff to buy so many shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.680" offset="5078079">A man like Weinstein for example said, “I buy 7 shares for a $1000 each, 7 out of 200.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.283" offset="5108485">Well the over issue doesn't permit that, but I say that what should be done here is that each man has made his contract, they vary, the prices vary, the terms vary and these contracts should govern and the stock certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.422" offset="5161044">What Judge Sugarman said was we'll ignore the contracts; we'll ignore the stock certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.685" offset="5182151">What we'll do is to use a money index what he called, I think the net fair value of the investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.168" offset="5208064">Now the major difference here -- well there are two differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.080" offset="5219662">One is, the price varied over a period of two years and there were good reasons why the price varied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.569" offset="5241605">In that sense, the people who came in early like one of our people Charles Kanter, at the very beginning, who paid $4000 for 12 shares, he got what may look like a bargain price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.605" offset="5285804">I say this bargain is not unconscionable and he is entitled to the benefit of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.341" offset="5304717">He paid $333 a share, some of the others -- most of the others paid a $1000 a share a year or two years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.916" offset="5335019">This man's money was traced into the purchase price first one in and the second one in; he is entitled to the benefit of this bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.169" offset="5364067">Judge Sugarman says no we'll use the money index.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.304" offset="5376606">Secondly, you got the problem of the so-called dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.435" offset="5393115">No money has been traced here, that's what Judge Sugarman said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.048" offset="5407535">The Court of Appeals set that finding aside and I submit that Judge Moore is wrong there, but that's a matter of Federal Law, your procedure Rule 52(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.517" offset="5441390">God knows that there is overwhelming evidence in support of Judge Sugarman's findings here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.402" offset="5460929">At any rate, this man John Malakoff out of his own bank account was paying 20% “Dividend” every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.613" offset="5493844">A man like Weinstein for example who came in at September of 1951 received this 20% on his $7000 for about 20 months, he got back 31% of his money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.313" offset="5544626">Other people who came in later got no dividends.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.227" offset="5556328">The worst example to me, is the situation with Kanter, he was getting dividends not on his $4000, but on more, because Malakoff respected the bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.486" offset="5601364">So, he got $3800 in dividend based on $12,000, although he had only paid in $8800.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.215" offset="5632188">Judge Sugarman would deduct this $3800 from Kanter's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.071" offset="5651623">So not only would he not get the benefit of his $4000 at the very beginning, but the dividends on more than his $8800 would all be deducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.726" offset="5690284">Now these dividends didn't come out of Nazareth, they came out of Malakoff's pocket.</text>

            <text syncTime="1414.335" offset="5760711">See, I'll put it to you this way Your Honor, I think the difficulty is that once you start to upset the benefit of a bargain, what these people agreed to and what's on the face of it is really not unconscionable, it is impossible to find any other rational basis, logical equitable basis as you can see from the difference between the Court of Appeals and the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.241" offset="5844302">What Judge Sugarman said was we will deduct the dividends from the principle amount leaving in Weinstein's case, only about $4600 instead of $7,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.331" offset="5884740">So Judge Moore said, we'll deduct the dividends, but not from the principle.</text>

            <text syncTime="1512.394" offset="6152965">No, Your honor the difference is the Ponzi was selling nothing, and Malakoff was selling something.</text>

            <text syncTime="1520.906" offset="6187029">They bought a piece of Nazareth and they got a piece of Nazareth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.287" offset="6200508">The price is varied over a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.091" offset="6211688">In effect I say that John Malakoff guaranteed dividends, of 20% a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.469" offset="6237288">He misrepresented that these dividends were being paid by Nazareth to him and by him over to these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.560" offset="6265605">This is no different from what's going on in New York now with these syndicates where people are guaranteed dividends and they went on paying them although the back -- the real estate behind it wasn't there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.316" offset="6308655">You can call it a misrepresentation, but the fact is that there are two pieces to it and the major piece is that the people got what they bargained for, they got the real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.241" offset="6348361">That's all that's left and they have it and the Ponzi element of it is paying the dividends out of capital is a completely separate thing, and you have to distinguish this from Ponzi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.277" offset="6392456">Ponzi gave these people nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.354" offset="6400815">There was nothing there except just the rotating capital and the profits on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.045" offset="6419519">That's not this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.993" offset="6427355">Secondly, the difference in price can be accounted for I think in two ways; you have to look at the different parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.814" offset="6454627">Where the cooperation is concerned, if there is anything unfair about issuing stock at different prices and there isn't when you have a reasonable basis for it, certainly time alone explains it then assess these people the difference, but don't interfere with their stock holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.071" offset="6519620">Charge them for it, but don't deprive them of their proportionate share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.127" offset="6535920">Secondly, I think this comes closest as to what Your Honor was saying Mr. Justice Goldberg, if the amount of the money, the difference in price is disturbing, what you are talking about I think is a fraudulent transfer concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.402" offset="6592972">Let me put the extreme example, which I think is what you are getting at.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.185" offset="6608123">Suppose that Malakoff goes to one man in September of 1951 and says I'll sell you share of stock for $1,000 a share, and then he turns around and the same day he says to somebody else, I'll sell you a share of stock, same interest to Nazareth for $10.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.598" offset="6673742">I mean gross enough difference I -- more gross difference couldn't be imagined beyond just giving it away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.303" offset="6700596">If Malakoff committed no wrong, if there had been no over issue when he owned the stock, he could probably have given it away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.707" offset="6730167">If there is a wrong the sort of thing you are talking about is a fraudulent transfer concept, that people dealing with Malakoff when Malakoff was committing the fraud, should not get something that caused other stockholders something else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.831" offset="6790666">Now, if you have a gross difference like that, I suppose you can say, and there is a question of fact involved here that any man who takes this share of stock for $10 when he knows that the market price is $1,000 and has reason to believe that Malakoff is committing a fraud, you ought to take that share of stock away from him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2336.198" offset="9448155">Now in this case unlike the other one, there doesn't seem to be any substantial dispute about the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.307" offset="9472606">There are two operative facts, which are important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.415" offset="9485040">One is, I better go back for a moment, the Debtor was continued in possession as I noted under his former management and as Your Honors may note, at the very outset, which I have is an order, this ex parte order that was signed in September of 1953, which stated that the Debtor by Arnold A. Weinstein and Jerome Fried, be authorized, directed and empowered to operate the business and manage the property of the Debtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.247" offset="9632371">Now you have a situation where no trustee is appointed and these two people, the President and the General Manager are de facto trustees and even the order sets it up as two of them equally operating this business, managing the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.485" offset="9693288">Now two things happened, one is, in the course of this reorganization these people bought stock of Nazareth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.906" offset="9734980">Weinstein bought stock not only for himself, but also for his sister and for Fried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.474" offset="9757236">They both bought stock for their own accounts and for others during the reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.719" offset="9782209">Now, this triggers at least this specific statute Section 249 of Chapter X, which says, in sweeping and I submit quite clear terms, no compensation shall be allowed to any person acting in a fiduciary capacity during the reorganization and while so acting buys or sells any stock or claims that are being reorganized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.212" offset="9896208">Now this is what Friendly's opinion addressed itself to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.085" offset="9911672">The District Judge had said, yes, it does apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.589" offset="9925778">These people are barred from compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.243" offset="9936332">Judge Friendly reversed his opinion construe Section 249 and says, no, it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.844" offset="9962768">Now, here you have a question of statutory interpretation and I think that the crux of this problem is that before you even get to the strict reading of the statute, which is quite clear in terms, I think the problem is that Judge Friendly begins by assuming that a corporation in reorganization is the same as any other corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.990" offset="10047300">And he says that normally there's nothing wrong with the persons who are officers of any corporation, nothing wrong with them buying the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.512" offset="10081468">So if they buy stock, or sell stock, or claims, you began with the assumption there's nothing wrong and then wants a penal sort of interpretation of anything that interferes with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.486" offset="10129324">Now the major problem is I think we have to begin by recognizing that it's normal for a corporation to be in a Chapter X proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.576" offset="10161716">This receivership is most abnormal and there's a special body of law that applies to this, it's partly statutory and partly decisional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.085" offset="10195675">And I submit that it's a fiction and not a norm to consider what would happen outside in a federal equity receivership court in terms of the obligations of these people.</text>

            <text syncTime="2581.481" offset="10429315">Now that has nothing to do with the matters that are being adjudicated except to the extent that curiously the very stock and issue that they bought is the stock that is an issue in the other cases and which is clouded by their particular objections and appeals in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2634.266" offset="10640488">That when Congress said it didn't want any of this trading, Congress meant what it said, and there's a history behind this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2828.182" offset="11416116">Thirdly there is the fact that you've got a relationship where Weinstein and Fried are suing individually as stockholders and they bring the Debtor in and they are using the Debtor that they control to take a certain position in this case where the Debtor has no interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.436" offset="11481109">And this is your third problem that presents certain conflicts of interest, their use of Debtor where the only benefit accrues to them individually as to the number of shares or a proportion of shares they would hold, and where they disclaim the only remedy the corporation would have, a money judgment on the stock for the unpaid subscriptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.986" offset="11567313">Now it's my position that they have these various conflicts of interest and that you have the special body of federal law that just denies compensation and would remove them, and should remove them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3090.442" offset="12465089">The other is that the other question that the Court never reached where the other grounds that were cited, this business about the rent diversions that were committed by Weinstein and Fried, you had a situation where Judge Sugarman said, all I'm going to consider is just the purchase of stock and I will consider that only under Section 249.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.815" offset="12554637">So he said, I don't have to consider anything else except just these bare facts that trigger the section, they bought the stock while they were fiduciaries of the debtor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3144.796" offset="12682533">I submit that the reason that the statue is absolute is that Congress and this Court in the past don't want this sort of inquiry.</text>

            <text syncTime="3165.371" offset="12764871">Now the other question is the race track matter; there Judge Sugarman said I'll put this off this until we have the question of the accounting of the rents, which came much later and is still pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.506" offset="12809383">When it got to the Circuit, Judge Friendly didn't even mention it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.080" offset="12823698">I mean his approach to this apparently was since Judge Sugarman didn't go any further than this, neither would he, but the difficulty is that not only didn't the Circuit consider it, but there was a refusal of remand so that it never got considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.915" offset="12879078">Now this again remains to be decided to address myself, I think to what Your Honor was referring to as to the scope of this Court's review, these facts are for the most part are undisputed as to what these people did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.348" offset="12940727">It's a question of the legal meaning of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.685" offset="12950131">I'm talking about the legal consequences only for purposes of compensation and continuing service, which is not the same as the accounting of the rents and for those purposes I submit if you had to and I hope you never have to get to it, if you had to get to that you could decide it on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.833" offset="13022751">But if you should agree with Judge Friendly, you still have the rest of this, this rent diversion problem, and I don't think you can just drop it as Judge Friendly did.</text>

            <text syncTime="3398.846" offset="13698800">I should also advise this Court that there was adjudication here to the extent of a petition in reorganization filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.374" offset="13748851">There has been no appeal from that and under Chapter X this corporation was bankrupt and in the reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.067" offset="13783646">Now, there was no appeal from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.186" offset="13792110">As a matter of fact that was contested by Mr. Margolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.693" offset="13810186">Again, I say the petitioner probably forgot about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.620" offset="13845817">I do think that even though I have short time I should tell this Court a little bit about the facts, which have not properly been explained to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.450" offset="13901197">Real estate syndication and promotion Your Honor has become big business and as a matter of fact, a great number of bankruptcy cases now are pending involving real estate promotion and syndication, bankruptcies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.929" offset="13967130">This case will act as precedence in that particular field as far as modern times are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.526" offset="14005478">Unfortunately, the syndicators and promoters of today take the public's money and they represent that capacity individually in escrow and for a specific investment in specific parcels of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.568" offset="14081651">In other words, a syndicator may have four or five parcels that he is selling to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.685" offset="14102131">He will come to Mr. A and say to Mr. A here is parcel, it is a good parcel, buy it at interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.236" offset="14132328">Mr. A, then gives the syndicator a check.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.673" offset="14146017">Unfortunately, Mr. A is the unsuspecting innocent public, he doesn't make out a check to the promoter in his name as Escrow E or the specific parcel in some instances, he gives them the check to his own order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.551" offset="14209546">In some instances, he even he makes it out as agent, in some instances he makes the check out as Escrow E.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.511" offset="14233370">The promoter in turn takes these checks; in some instances deposits it into a special account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.691" offset="14258134">When he is a high class honest promoter, he keeps it intact for the specific purpose given to him to invest in a specific parcel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.556" offset="14289586">When he is a crook or an embezzler as John Malakoff was, he takes the money, diverts much of it for his own use; uses part of it for one purpose, part of it for another purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="3572.600" offset="14393762">Eddy Malakoff was a real estate operator.</text>

            <text syncTime="3582.278" offset="14432528">He had an uncle, John in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.117" offset="14447888">John was a promoter and syndicator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.013" offset="14463457">Eddy Malakoff had paid only $47,500 cash for the entire parcel, subject to certain adjustments.</text>

            <text syncTime="3645.329" offset="14684662">The money was given by these people.</text>

            <text syncTime="3662.805" offset="14754565">These moneys that were paid for the purchase of this Nazareth Market was entered on the books of a partnership as a capital contribution, so that the purchase price of $47,500 cash was the capital contribution of a partnership although, they have titled in several corporate banks because they gyrated this property between two corporations and two partnerships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.335" offset="14872743">I cannot have the time to go into that Your Honors, it's within the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.457" offset="14905240">Then, John Malakoff agreed to buy the entire market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.931" offset="14943065">It must be borne in mind that the $16,000 that the original four people gave as their investment was entered in the books and records not in their credit, but for the credit of John Malakoff, the promoter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.863" offset="14990817">It must also be borne in mind that -- and according to the record of Malakoff, he was only to get one-third profit in the event of resale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.920" offset="15023104">So, he owned nothing at that time in equity and in fact merely a technical entry in a book.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.164" offset="15068035">The peculiar thing is Your Honors that the petitioner in his main brief and throughout eight years or seven years has contended that John Malakoff owned this Nazareth equitably and owned the stock of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.463" offset="15129266">He has never submitted to this Court the basis of that ownership, because there is none, factually there isn't any, none of John Malakoff's money went into this transaction, not one cent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.225" offset="15172315">As a matter of fact, he defrauded the public and took almost $100,000 and pocketed it, over and above the purchase price and this is how he and the Philadelphia group did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.377" offset="15220903">When John Malakoff agreed to buy sometime in July of 1951, the entire Nazareth deal, in fact he was acting for the general public, because he was going to get the money from them not his money.</text>

            <text syncTime="3879.010" offset="15619427">As he got their money, he paid off the Philadelphia group.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.765" offset="15638444">Not only did he do that, but the Philadelphia group converted this capital contribution that I spoke of, the $47,500 cash from a contribution in the partnership books.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.849" offset="15702810">They converted it into a loan account, so here we have the purchase price, again an indebtedness of the partnership and they then formed the Debtor Corporation and transposed the ledger sheet into the corporate books of account.</text>

            <text syncTime="3930.673" offset="15826108">John Malakoff is collecting money from innocent investors and Bank of Philadelphia on top of it, almost $60,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.116" offset="15867800">And the Debtor Corporation is insolvent, because the only capital that they left was $1500, the rest were debts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.616" offset="15897788">The property was covered by the debts of the purchase price sold to Philadelphia and owed to John Malakoff and that's how they started.</text>

            <text syncTime="4106.044" offset="16527548">The Court of Appeals said the people that actually gave the money for a specific purpose, for a specific investment for this venture, their hard earned dollars, widows, they are the ones that are entitled to share, not people whose debts were satisfied by this fraudulent promoter's acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4125.917" offset="16607065">Certainly this Court would not allow this fraudulent promoter to satisfy his own debts with interests in a venture, which would result in a depletion of the innocent people's investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4140.943" offset="16667146">In other words, the property cost $66,000, $47,500 cash and that was the market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.782" offset="16714480">The petitioner gets up and says there was no value on this property, that's an absolute untruth Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4159.716" offset="16742275">The market value at the time of purchase and sale, it's in the record, was $66,000, $47,500 cash only $9,000 in improvements that was the value.</text>
            <text syncTime="4173.511" offset="16797445">Now people gave approximately $160,000, innocent investors, to allow Malakoff's creditors satisfaction of their debt to come in.</text>

            <text syncTime="4275.398" offset="17204955">Thank you very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.051" offset="17215613">Now, Your Honors would kindly understand what this Philadelphia group and John Malakoff did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4285.379" offset="17244871">They converted those capital contributions into loan accounts and that's the way they carried the thing right through into the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.483" offset="17273292">So they became creditors of the corporation for the purchase price which was paid for by the general public and they pocketed an additional $100,000 as far as John Malakoff is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="4302.564" offset="17313625">Now, this is the man that these petitioners come in and say own this property, and this is the man they say could satisfy his debts by giving interest to his creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4316.400" offset="17369004">I wouldn't care whether it was State Law, whether it was Federal Law, International Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.931" offset="17391052">There is no law in this world that would sustain that kind of a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.289" offset="17416547">Gentlemen, there is no issue that Malakoff was a promoter or a syndicator and a fiduciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4335.543" offset="17445595">He used to get receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.974" offset="17459284">The investors received receipts from him showing, in many instances, that he held the money in escrow; he held the money as agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.679" offset="17498049">The checks were made out in many instances as agent and Escrow E.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.343" offset="17512782">There were cases cited where that type of a situation clearly creates a trustee and fiduciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.565" offset="17553638">He only was supposed to get a management fee, that's in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4372.728" offset="17594284">The key and the finish to this entire situation happened as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="4377.349" offset="17612779">On December of 1952, Malakoff was already in trouble with some of the innocent investors and he went down to Philadelphia to get the books and records and everything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4386.592" offset="17649768">And when he went down to Philadelphia to get the books and records in December of 1952, he brought his accountant along and he brought Mr. Haller's attorney along.</text>
            <text syncTime="4395.961" offset="17687176">And at that time, the accountant examined the records and he said what's happened to the money that belonged -- that the investors gave, the testimony is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.390" offset="17728972">Mr. Malakoff said I'll put it in later.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.055" offset="17743600">Now, Malakoff, if he owned this thing, he didn't have to put any money back.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.848" offset="17762722">Now, on top of that as additional proof of this terrible fraud that was committed here on which the petitioner relies that Malakoff's creditors should share in this estate, comes May and June of 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="4429.851" offset="17822804">And again, Mr. Malakoff now is in very serious trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="4433.893" offset="17838895">Some one had gone to the District Attorney's office, there were all kinds of trouble and that's in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4439.309" offset="17860629">And Mr. Malakoff goes ahead with his attorney Mr. How, who was a Director and Officer of the Corporation back in December 1952 as well as in May and June of 1953 and they pre-date and draw a fraudulent set of minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4453.422" offset="17917053">And what do they do in these minutes?</text>
            <text syncTime="4455.416" offset="17924995">They provide that Malakoff is to get the stock for $75 a share and he was selling it for a $1,000 and why did they do it, to cover up the fraud and he didn't even pay the $75.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.492" offset="17989360">He went and credited against his phony loan account.</text>
            <text syncTime="4478.300" offset="18016528">Now, this is the man from, through and under whom his creditors received interests, which diminished the interest of innocent investors whom this petitioner comes in and says the Court of Appeals did wrong in disallowing these interests.</text>

            <text syncTime="4518.358" offset="18176815">He used the corporation as his alter ego.</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.452" offset="18189145">He defrauded.</text>
            <text syncTime="4523.704" offset="18198235">His receipts that he gave and his contracts that he gave, he stated that if he wanted to change it to a corporation he could change to a limited partnership, so the intention of the parties was also, that this was merely a transitory vehicle, the corporation merely held title temporarily, what these people really were buying was shares and interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.403" offset="18288933">Under those circumstances, through true justice, technical corporate law is necessary here, what is the truth here?</text>
            <text syncTime="4554.391" offset="18320906">They were buying shares in this Nazareth market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4558.272" offset="18336475">This is a perfect case for setting aside the corporation and what was each man's interest, what money did he pay, that's what he's entitled to, and that's based on dollars and cents, that's the fairest way.</text>

            <text syncTime="4580.946" offset="18427173">As a matter of fact, the Court of Appeals felt, let's take these innocent people; they are the ones that are entitled a share of the creditors of Malakoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="4591.714" offset="18470222">They didn't change their position any.</text>
            <text syncTime="4594.183" offset="18480149">This was an antecedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4597.104" offset="18491747">No estoppel of any kind can be held there against the innocent people, certainly an estoppel can be held, whether it's a joint venture or whether it's a corporation with a President and officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4609.110" offset="18539813">One more thing, bear in mind, that this President of this corporation John Malakoff, when he satisfied a debt of a personal credit, then that was a personal transaction, he wasn't acting in a representative capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4623.782" offset="18598536">This was a personal transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4626.577" offset="18609716">In the instance of the innocent investors, there he was acting in a representative capacity as agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4635.584" offset="18645661">Now there were fundamental differences between the investors and non-investors, they are apparent on the face of it, and why the Court of Appeals held it the way they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="4646.398" offset="18688920">The investors gave their actual dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="4650.335" offset="18704697">The non-investors gave nothing, because they merely got paid in satisfaction of a personal debt of John Malakoff to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4658.863" offset="18738866">They changed their position, nothing, they gave nothing, and antecedent debt is not a good faith purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="4669.831" offset="18782647">The investors relied on John Malakoff in a representative capacity, the non-investors could not rely on them in a representative capacity, because the non-investors satisfied merely a debt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.743" offset="18862373">Now, this was in fraud of creditors incidentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4694.268" offset="18880449">There were existing creditors, and the statement showed there were existing creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.152" offset="18899989">So what was done by John Malakoff to satisfy his own debt?</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.988" offset="18919320">Would estoppel of corporation where the money should have gone into the treasury was of absolute fraud of existing and future creditors, that's beside the point, beside the innocent stuff.</text>

            <text syncTime="4860.230" offset="19544273">They haven't given one case of New York State or Pennsylvania or any other state, which shows that in an insolvent state, people that haven't paid for an interest, that are creditors of any promoter are entitled to share on an equal basis with innocent investors.</text>
            <text syncTime="4878.396" offset="19616998">There isn't a case they have given on it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4889.099" offset="19659734">And I say Your Honors there can be no Court that under these circumstances would give creditors of a fraudulent promoter and interest in the lease of bankrupt estate, which results in diminution of the interest of innocent investors, it can't be.</text>
            <text syncTime="4912.741" offset="19754297">There has been much ado raised about the Rules of Decision Act Your Honors and the Rules of Decision Act was decided in Local Loan Company against Hunt, 292 U. S. 234.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.676" offset="19802049">In that case, the Court clearly surveyed it, it's on Page 17 on my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4929.169" offset="19820022">The Court clearly said, we find it unnecessary to consider whether this contention would in a different case find support in 34 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, now 725, titled so and so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4939.842" offset="19862758">Since we are of the opinion that it is precluded here by the clear and unmistakable policy of the Bankruptcy Act that is important to bear in mind that the present case is one not within the jurisdiction of a State Court, but as the defendant suit to vindicate the decrease of the Federal Court of Bankruptcy anchored in the exercise of the jurisdiction essentially Federal and exclusive in character and in that situation, which we address ourselves until which our decision is confined.</text>
            <text syncTime="4969.317" offset="19980622">Naturally, if the Bankruptcy Court has to weigh, sift the different rights of the different parties to the lease, they must depend on particular circumstances of the case and they must equitably apply their own principle, because it depends on each particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.811" offset="20066617">In the case of Erie against Tomkins, which has raised such a big bubble by the petitioner and which for a while was troublesome to most of the Federal Courts, because previously the Federal Courts clearly had said, a Bankruptcy Court does not have to apply generally State Law, it can apply its own principles according to the circumstances of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5017.500" offset="20173406">Erie against Tomkins came along and that was a tort case, a non-diversity tort case and the Court in that case properly held it's a tort case, non-diversity case, happened in a particular state, we should apply the laws of that state, they were correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.472" offset="20237249">Unfortunately, students of the law and the lower Courts started to apply that case to bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.282" offset="20260551">What happened Your Honors?</text>
            <text syncTime="5040.763" offset="20266402">On three occasions, this Court has held that Erie against Tomkins doesn't apply in bankruptcy cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5047.251" offset="20292420">They held it in Pepper against Litton, now I haven't got time to read the full decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="5056.885" offset="20330872">They held it in Heiser against Woodruff and they held it again in the Vanston case that Your Honor Judge Black asked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="5068.966" offset="20379251">I am sorry, I believe Judge Brennan asked about the Vanston case originally.</text>
            <text syncTime="5075.459" offset="20405164">Now, in the Vanston case, it explicitly states in determining what claims at Vanston against Green 329 U.S. 156 clearly stated in determining what claims are allowable and how a debtor's assets shall be distributed, the Bankruptcy Court does not apply the law of the state where it sits.</text>
            <text syncTime="5096.752" offset="20490428">Erie against Tomkins had no such implication, but Bankruptcy Courts must administer and enforce the Bankruptcy Act as interpreted by this Court in accordance with authority granted by Congress to determine how and what claims shall be allowed and under what equitable principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="5113.117" offset="20555839">In Gardner against New Jersey and this was a case where the state came in and said, we are entitled to certain taxes, our law says this is what we are entitled to get.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.575" offset="20601710">And you must recognize our State Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5128.677" offset="20618115">In that case and if we had to recognize State Law then, then presumably and this Court would so hold, we'd have to recognize it throughout.</text>
            <text syncTime="5137.667" offset="20654059">And in the Gardner case, the Court held, without that sifting process, unmeritorious or excessive claims might dilute the participation of the legitimate claimants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5149.464" offset="20701184">It is the traditional Bankruptcy Law that he who invokes the aid of the Bankruptcy Court by offering a proof of claim and determining its allowance must abide the consequences of that procedure, [Inaudible] on bankruptcy clearly supports the contention that a Bankruptcy Court has to go through this sifting process.</text>
            <text syncTime="5174.780" offset="20802539">What the petitioners would like a Bankruptcy Court to become is an administrative office.</text>
            <text syncTime="5181.645" offset="20829915">Once a state says a claim theoretically is good, the Bankruptcy Court must acknowledge it and must allow it to share.</text>
            <text syncTime="5189.600" offset="20861785">The Federal Court is not an administrative office and that was not intended by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="5194.516" offset="20881429">They have a right to look behind a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="5196.606" offset="20889788">Even if it's a judgment, where it hasn't been tried and proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5202.174" offset="20912044">They can look behind the claim to see if it has any merit and this is exactly what the Court of Appeals did in this particular case and their ruling on that base should be approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="5230.947" offset="21027192">Now a very unique and a very unusual theory were expounded by the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.161" offset="21060002">He called it recapitalization and he said what these promoters did, what the Philadelphia group and John and Eddy Malakoff was business sophistication, the words sound beautiful.</text>

            <text syncTime="5277.008" offset="21211408">The question of res judicata is very important to me Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5279.918" offset="21223006">I've worked on this case for nine years, 10 years for this debtor unfortunately so, unfortunately so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.095" offset="21259786">As an officer of this Court and as an Attorney for the debtor and debtor in position, I felt that it was my duty to find out who are the honest claimants and who are the dishonest claimants and put everybody to their proof, I didn't pick any particular claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5302.665" offset="21314017">When the claimants put in their proof, all the claimants put in their proof and I made every one of them put their proof through a trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="5328.937" offset="21419133">The District Court allowed all the claims investors, non-investors whoever it was and I felt that was an error, but then allowing all the claims control was timed over to a Mr. Danciger and to the petitioner's group, control of the Board of the Directors of this debtor and the result was that they didn't allow me to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="5352.023" offset="21511502">They wouldn't even pay for the brief, printing of the brief, I felt it was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="5356.073" offset="21527698">Fortunately, they appealed and I interposed this entire case to the Court of Appeals and interposed this claim that we are entitled to receive money in the event stock is allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5372.907" offset="21594990">The Court of Appeals fortunately granted the first alternative relief, they disallowed the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="5378.550" offset="21617560">Under those circumstances, I couldn't ask for money.</text>

            <text syncTime="5385.531" offset="21645458">If by chance, this Court for any technical reason allows these claims, I say there is no res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="5393.202" offset="21676178">I still should be entitled on behalf of this debtor to get the money into this Debtor Corporation that wasn't paid for the purchase of stock by these non-investors.</text>

            <text syncTime="6216.088" offset="24967711">Weinstein, while he had more authority as President of the debtor in possession was there not as a matter of merely being employed as Fried was, but as being appointed under Section 191 of the Bankruptcy Act with his salary of $50 a week being fixed by the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="7109.187" offset="28540113">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="7117.318" offset="28572609">Your Honor let me -- if the Court please let me say just one or two things about what Mr. Rosen had said on the stock claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="7124.821" offset="28602702">First of all, Mr. Rosen said something about the widowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="7128.927" offset="28619107">This is an interesting plea, because one of these widowers is Mr. Fried, his claim was allowed for $2,000, and as the record will show, this is one of the points that's been raised about the arbitrary standard as a matter of Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="7145.065" offset="28683682">Fried's $2,000 was a credit for a profit on another deal he had with Malakoff, for whom he had worked certainly since 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="7154.105" offset="28719835">His claim was allowed whereas other claims were disallowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7157.784" offset="28734464">You have both an arbitrariness in the application of this standard and a setting aside of facts by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="7166.160" offset="28768005">Now, what Mr. Rosen has been saying to Your Honors is that everything he has referred to is in the record, but what is in the record, in the sense that you've got a record of about 12,000 pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="7179.448" offset="28821191">There is in utter disregard of the findings and if you'd pay – if you note this distinction between this massive evidence in the record and the findings, I think, Your Honors will find that many of Mr. Rosen's statements are simply unsupported by findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="7196.604" offset="28889840">Finally, this whole theory hangs on a concept of investors which is important I think in terms of this notion of fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="7205.918" offset="28927039">What it reduces to is Judge Morris saying pretty much, if a man wants to invest in a deal, a corporation or a venture, the only way he can do it is to make a direct investment say to the corporation like AT&amp;T or U.S. Steel.</text>
            <text syncTime="7222.433" offset="28993076">If he pays the money to the corporation, then he gets an interest, he intends to invest, but if he pays the money to a broker or an underwriter or another stockholder for that AT&amp;T stock, then he does not intend to invest and I submit that there just isn't any sense to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="7239.664" offset="29062040">On top of which, what you have is the fact that everyone of these 36 paid his money to Malakoff, and the District Court found there's an implicit finding of intention there, that everyone of these 36 without distinction intended to buy what Malakoff himself had to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="7258.819" offset="29138631">And that finding is based on the sort of evidence that I've copied at pages 23 and 24 of the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="7266.517" offset="29169455">Weinstein himself testified to on the road and what he put into a Proof of Claim, he drafted this key letter -- letter received that most of the stockholders received and used in their relationship with Malakoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="7281.508" offset="29229432">Finally – I'll stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="7287.027" offset="29251480">Thank you.</text>
