            <text syncTime="11.714" offset="150235">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.074" offset="175626">This case involves the issue as to whether the petitioner has been deprived of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment by the introduction, into his trial on a charge of robbery, of a confession which was obtained from him under circumstances, including being booked for investigation, being held incommunicado, being refused permission to call his wife or an attorney under a regular practice and procedure of the Spokane Police Department in violation of a state law in which a confession was signed by him some 16 hours after his arrest and in which he was not informed of his constitutional rights until he was brought before a magistrate some 18 and a half hours after arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.128" offset="391920">There is a second issue in the case which has been raised in the filing of a supplemental brief as to whether the confessions obtained from him after an arrest without probable cause should be excluded on the basis of the decisions of Mapp versus Ohio, holding the exclusionary rule applicable to the states and Wong Sun versus United States, holding that verbal evidence which has been obtained after an arrest without probable cause fall within the scope of the exclusionary principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.185" offset="532146">The facts in the case are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.332" offset="544684">On December 19, 1957, a robbery occurred in the City of Spokane, two men were involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.525" offset="581465">The police were called.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.882" offset="586898">Within 10 minutes, one of the men was captured.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.636" offset="605915">Fifteen minutes later, a prowl car, some five blocks from the scene of the robbery which had received what was described as an incomplete description of the remaining robber, spotted the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.762" offset="682402">As the prowl car approached, he started up the yard of a house.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.452" offset="705181">The police shown a spotlight on him, he is called back to the car, they question him for a few moments.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.700" offset="746141">Apparently satisfied with his explanation and the discussion, he was permitted to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.331" offset="772681">He walked back up the yard of the house to the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.338" offset="788773">He fumbled with a key at the storm door.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.588" offset="801729">In the meanwhile, the police sat in the prowl car, did not move, and watched him.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.662" offset="825971">He then walked back toward the police car and it's a little unclear from the record exactly what transpired first.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.364" offset="864841">However, the office -- the arresting officer testified that he walked back to the car, he's placed under arrest, and apparently, at the same time or near the same time he said, “You got me, let's go.”</text>
            <text syncTime="209.001" offset="939342">After being placed in the police car, the officer testified, this Officer Usher, that he admitted the robbery that he was crying, that he was taken to the scene of the robbery, that he identified it and then in response to a call from headquarters he was taken back to headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.181" offset="1036100">At headquarters, he was booked for investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.717" offset="1062222">He was searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.579" offset="1069641">He had not been frisked or handcuffed during the ride back to the police station.</text>

            <text syncTime="256.293" offset="1128573">There is no evidence in the record on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.255" offset="1156368">It maybe inferred I believe though that it is not the petitioner's house because in the record, he gives his address and his address apparently is not the same as this house.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.066" offset="1211643">There was no attention called to that point on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.318" offset="1244662">That -- he arrived back at the police station approximately 10 p.m., which was about a half hour after being arrested, he was interrogated in an interrogation room by Lieutenant Wakeley of the Spokane Police Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.139" offset="1319894">During the interrogation, the petitioner testified that he asked several times for permission to call his wife and to call an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.319" offset="1368691">Lieutenant Wakeley testified that he could not remember whether he did or not, he might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.341" offset="1420727">Apparently, there was no warning of constitutional rights, the right to remain silent nor the right to contact counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.693" offset="1462105">Lieutenant Wakeley testified that being held on what was called small book or held for investigation meant that he was held incommunicado.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.414" offset="1505050">He could not call out nor could he receive incoming calls nor visitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.792" offset="1534516">The only discussion as to whether an attorney could get in to see him was that if an attorney had been contacted to by the family that would be another matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.654" offset="1590000">It's not indicated that an attorney could get in.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.137" offset="1599927">However, it was fairly clear from the testimony of both Lieutenant Wakeley and other police officers that the practices to hold him incommunicado without his having permission to call out nor anyone having permission to come in to see him or to contact him.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.212" offset="1688221">He -- he testified that he asked for permission to call his wife or an attorney during the evening he was being interrogated by Lieutenant Wakeley.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.232" offset="1740257">Lieutenant Wakeley stated that he could not remember whether he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.374" offset="1760841">He might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.462" offset="1765230">Apparently, there was more emphasis in his request for permission to call out to call his wife because subsequently in talking about the interrogation the following morning, he indicated that he had mentally changed his mind about wanting permission to call an attorney directly, but wanted to get his wife -- going to call his wife so that she could contact an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.948" offset="1867212">He raised the question that he didn't want to have two attorneys coming in at the same time that if he got one and his wife got one, he would have the problem of paying two attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.428" offset="1905037">However, he indicated that was a mental thought process that he went through rather than anything that he stated, but there is no flat denial on the part of the -- any of the police that he made such request to call.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.374" offset="1972851">Both Lieutenant Wakeley that evening and Officer Cockburn who interrogated the following morning stated in a somewhat similar terms that they could not remember whether he made such request that he might have in one case or that he could have stated by Officer Cockburn.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.700" offset="2186219">The -- there's nothing to indicate that there was any interrogation after midnight of that evening.</text>

            <text syncTime="1271.301" offset="5188524">And they haven't done it entirely or they haven't done on the basis of McNabb-Mallory which has been an exclusionary rule based on a supervisorial power of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.852" offset="5242755">I agree, it approaches close to McNabb-Mallory but I think that the limits in the -- and the scope of it will be different under particular circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.847" offset="5302732">The wife in this case testified that she called the police, attempted to find out information about her husband, but was told that it was all in the morning papers, to get the papers and read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.389" offset="5364903">She testified that she came the following day on a Saturday and picked up the car, and testified that she was not permitted to see him until a week after his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.723" offset="5422268">He testified that he was not allowed to call his wife until either five or seven days after the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.043" offset="5471587">After signing the confession, he was brought before a magistrate at 4 o'clock of that afternoon which is some eighteen and a half hours after the arrest where he was first informed of his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.673" offset="5534072">After that, he was brought to the prosecutor's office on several occasions and was asked to sign new statements and he refused to do it in his testimony on the grounds that he had not been permitted to call his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.262" offset="5608469">It's I think pertinent to point out that he has a prior criminal record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.152" offset="5635950">This was brought out during the trial when he took the stand and the evidence was given that he had been convicted at prior times of robbery, breaking and entering which was a gross misdemeanor in the State, drunken driving, resisting arrest, and taking a car without permission, and breaking jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1599.509" offset="6501439">Now, this has been expressed in various ways by the Court to whether the confession is involuntary, whether it was obtained as a result of coercion or whether it's a combination of factors, including the extraction of it by impermissible means plus the compulsion that should prevent -- that was -- the Fifth Amendment was designed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.120" offset="6611884">It is clear that the trustworthiness, the truth of the confession is not the proper issue in determining its admissibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.244" offset="6652322">It should be pointed out that this confession was obtained under a regular practice and procedure of the Spokane Police Department.</text>

            <text syncTime="1653.635" offset="6717942">The uniform crime reports, the last one in 1961 indicated, for example, that there are 136,000 arrests on suspicion or investigation, they used it somewhat synonymously, in which individuals are arrested sufficiently so that the statistics are reported to the Department of Justice and the FBI and are collected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.890" offset="6806967">And that those people have been arrested and are never brought before a magistrate but are released without a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.812" offset="6834657">Here in the District of Columbia last year, there was a good deal of attention on this question and there were approximately 6000 arrests for investigation in spite of the fact that we have in McNabb-Mallory rule which is applicable in the District of Columbia, but in the Spokane Police Department, this was an established practice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.988" offset="6927339">It was the small book that if a person wasn't charged with a crime, he was held for investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.506" offset="6961403">There was nothing to take him before a magistrate because a magistrate would -- function at that point would be to determine if there was probable cause for an arrest and of course there's no probable cause which could be determined if the person is merely brought before a magistrate having been arrested for investigation, having been booked for investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1830.580" offset="7425651">However, there have been cases that have been decided which hold that mere submissiveness is not a surrender or does not waive the rights to object to an arrest without probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.123" offset="7479881">In the District of Columbia, there was a Court of Appeals decision in which the Court's, Kelley versus United States, 298 F.2d 310, the Court of Appeals said, “It is sufficient if the person arrested understands that he is in the power of the one arresting and submits in consequence.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.129" offset="7547904">And in the Ray case in this Court, the Court stated, “It is the right of one placed under arrest to submit to custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.972" offset="7583222">Probable cause cannot be found from submissiveness.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.553" offset="7597537">Now, here, I agree that there is a problem here as to what actually happened at the time of arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.632" offset="7633899">I believe a reasonable construction though is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.442" offset="7653125">Here, is a situation of a man who had been stopped on a street corner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.769" offset="7670471">As far as the police were concerned at that point they had no probable cause to hold that man for the crime -- for whose solution that they were working.</text>

            <text syncTime="1907.397" offset="7732955">That the description was vague and uncertain and they let him go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.347" offset="7752808">But they were suspicious, not probable cause but suspicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.728" offset="7770258">So they sat there and watched.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.128" offset="7783842">They waited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.908" offset="7791052">They watched and go up to the house and then he fumbled with the key and he came back down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.646" offset="7813935">Now I believe a reasonable construction is he never really was free to go at that point, that they sat there and watched, and he was like -- he was on the end of a rubber band.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.888" offset="7866911">They watched him go up to the door and they pulled him back in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.043" offset="7875584">He could not have walked by the police car, I believe that -- and Officer Usher testified that he got out of the car and arrested him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.593" offset="7917693">Now, I agree there is some ambiguity here as to whether he got out of the car, when the man was walking back, and therefore went to meet him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.827" offset="7954683">But I believe that the man was not free to walk down from the house and then walk away that the police are waiting for him and that his statement, “You got me, let's go”, is merely an acknowledgment, “You've got me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.670" offset="8010062">I am under -- I'm under arrest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.533" offset="8021556">And his testimony says he saw they were waiting out there and decided -- he gave up the ghost and he -- he walked back down.</text>
