            <text syncTime="2277.302" offset="9212531">Now it is held that this is an improper expenditure of union dues under a union-shop.</text>

            <text syncTime="3898.500" offset="15697377">What this Court was concerned about in the Street, as I understand it, and the reason this Court set the Street judgment back as I understand it was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.602" offset="15745755">That in working the unlawful operation of the union-shop agreement, there must not be interference with the union-shop agreement functioning in its collective bargaining area, in its proper spheres.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.162" offset="15812002">There, in other words, the Court considered that the judgment there perpetually enjoining, sweeping broadly, denying all collection of any nature was an interference with the bargaining function of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.419" offset="15873024">And therefore, sent that -- reversed that judgment and undid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.720" offset="15890265">And I am saying Your Honor, that the judgment here touches and inhibits the union-shop agreement only in its unlawful sphere, and not at all in its other operations.</text>

            <text syncTime="4019.800" offset="16182523">Each case would resolve nothing except the amount of money involved in that case only.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.040" offset="16207496">And the employee in order to maintain the right of keeping his money from going for political purpose would have to sue again and again renewed, successively, perpetually to maintain that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.827" offset="16262666">Now, this Court has said that this area is one of the utmost gravity.</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.988" offset="16287326">The issues underlying here are indeed important ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.023" offset="16311463">They are vital, not only to individual liberty, if the Court please, they are crucial to the integrity of the Government itself for if arrangements are established by which collective representatives can require employees to pay money as a condition of working and can then take that money and elect whom they wish to public office and enact laws as they will, then we may be on the road toward distinction of important individual liberty and free government as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="4087.963" offset="16455241">It may -- it serves not, if the Court please, to declare this taking and using for political purposes to be unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.140" offset="16495888">It avails not to declare it unlawful, if no meaningful, practical remedy is granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.676" offset="16526085">And its purpose can still be accomplished and it can be still accomplished and will be accomplished unless injunction avails.</text>
