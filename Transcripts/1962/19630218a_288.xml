            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 288, National Labor Relations Board, Petitioner, versus Erie Resistor Corporation et al.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="36.076" offset="247724">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.764" offset="266428">This case is here on certiorari to the Third Circuit, which denied enforcement of the Board's order against the respondent, Erie Resistor, a manufacturer of electrical components and plastics in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.699" offset="334137">The Board found that Erie violated the National Labor Relations Act by awarding in the course of an economic strike, 20 years additional seniority to replacements for strikers and also to strikers who return to work during the strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.817" offset="426611">So that in a subsequent layoff, strikers who did not return to work until after the strike terminated were laid off as junior employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.709" offset="482200">And the question presented in this case is whether the grant of a seniority advantage to employees who go to work during a strike was the concomitant reduction in the seniority's standing of those strikers who elect to remain out on a strike, discriminates an employment and restrains and coerces the exercise of the right to strike in violation of Sections 8 (a) (1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.083" offset="659728">Now the underlying facts that give rise to this problem are these: On March 31, 1959, Local 613 of the International Union of Electrical Workers, the certified representative of the company's production and maintenance employees called a strike when the parties were unable to agree upon the terms of a new contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.309" offset="780622">The strike was joined by all of the approximately 478 employees working in the unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.077" offset="819702">In addition at that time, there were about 450 employees in the unit or in a layoff status.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.348" offset="856795">Throughout April, the Company operated on a reduced basis by transferring about 140 clerical and nonunit employees to the production and maintenance unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.868" offset="922833">On May 3rd, however, the Company notified all members of the Union by a letter that it intended to hire replacements and its strikers would retain their jobs until replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.643" offset="985945">In accordance with that --</text>

            <text syncTime="226.670" offset="1010082">Under Mackay, which I'll come to in greater detail, the Company had a right to do that, to replace the strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.743" offset="1042369">In accordance with this notice, the Company began to hire replacements.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.483" offset="1073298">It picked up one new hire and 23 from the layoff status.</text>

            <text syncTime="396.803" offset="1690624">The reason I say I believe is that the Board has yet -- has never had a case where it has been offered only to new employees and as I'd like to develop later, I think it's a practical matter if it would be impossible to have such as it sounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.142" offset="1759901">Because if you're going to have some old employees that are going to go to work as you're likely to have, it would be impossible not to -- not to extend the benefit to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.802" offset="1814549">As a matter of fact, that has been the case in every one of the cases that we've had so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.411" offset="1837014">Now, on a bargaining session held on May 11th, the Company told the union that it was promising replacements job security and that in order to implement this promise, it would be necessary to accord them some form of super-seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.181" offset="1928129">Now, you had about five bargaining sessions that were held between May 11th and May 28th.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.883" offset="1958954">The Company proposed several alternative forms of super-seniority offering to negotiate the precise nature of it, but insisting in each case that it had to have super-seniority in some form.</text>

            <text syncTime="515.506" offset="2165426">And he states that we would -- talking about on May 11th, that we would have to accord them some sort of super-seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.421" offset="2225089">And then when we get down to the meeting on May 28th, he gets more specific and points out that the -- it looked as though the super-seniority would have to be in the neighborhood of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.996" offset="2287365">So that I think it is quite clear from the (Inaudible) -- from the record that the company officials themselves characterized this thing as super-seniority, but whatever it was characterized as, it was quite clear that the arrangement that they had in mind was an arrangement that would give to those employees who went to work during the strike whether they were new hires, employees from the layoff status, or strikers who left the picket line, they had to be given, if they went back to work before the end of the strike, a seniority advantage that would put them ahead of those employees who remained out on strike.</text>
