            <label>Mr. Ephraim London</label>
            <text syncTime="54.525" offset="321494">Mr. Chief Justice and Associate Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.979" offset="347303">If the Court please, this is a reargument of an appeal from an order of the Ohio Supreme Court affirming the conviction of Jacobellis, the appellant, on two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.981" offset="411251">One count was for possession of a film, motion picture film, that was found by the Court to be obscene and the other count was for showing or exhibiting the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.181" offset="476139">The picture that's involved in this case is the motion picture called “Lovers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="101.637" offset="509889">The first question that's presented by the appeal is whether or not this picture is obscene, if it is not obscene under constitutional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.983" offset="551267">That's an end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.140" offset="571956">And to make that or to consider that question, I think we must first consider the standards by which a film must be judged and I should add that I don't think that this film can be judged obscene by any constitutionally acceptable standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.337" offset="676760">But the criteria for judgment in determining whether or not a film is obscene are set out in Roth and Alberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.733" offset="718346">But the highest courts of the various states had considerable difficulty in applying those standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.760" offset="766412">And there are many questions that have been raised with respect to the meaning of the Roth-Alberts standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.528" offset="833494">The first question in which there have been differences of opinion in the state courts is whether it was intended by the Roth-Alberts decision to allow the suppression of punishment of only what is termed hardcore pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.692" offset="954180">And I hope that that I won't be asked to define that term but it's been used by many of the courts and I understand that to mean that which is not only obscene but so flagrantly, patently, blatantly obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.179" offset="1028054">That there could be no difference of opinion between men of -- whose opinion is to be respected between reputable people with respect to whether or not that matter is actually obscene or not.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>

            <label>Mr. Ephraim London</label>
            <text syncTime="252.608" offset="1113840">Well, I assume that the society is ours and I think we're going to have to explore that question too because that question of which society is to be the judge or according to the standards of which society is another matter that is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.965" offset="1171205">And there's also another matter about which the state courts differ in connection with a specific application of the term community standards, what the community has intended to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.028" offset="1223450">But if I may speak first to the question of hardcore pornography, I take it from reading of the cases that this Court has decided that have related to punishment of -- of matter found to or suspected or charged of violating federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.546" offset="1329507">That something like the standard of hardcore pornography does apply where a federal statute is involved and where a federal prosecution is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.119" offset="1383842">I've made that assumption from a reading of the various cases that this Court has -- has determined, some without opinion and such cases as Manual against Day where the -- certainly, the -- at least one of the opinions is very clear in indicating that only what was patently offensive and obnoxious would be considered obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.224" offset="1500244">In relation to a federal case and the question is whether the same rule will apply where there is a state prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.222" offset="1544234">None of course relates to the very much broader question as to whether the First Amendment means the same thing in a state prosecution as it does in a federal prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2822.306" offset="11392606">Now, going immediately to the question of whether or not the rule is or should be hardcore pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.765" offset="11422386">The law of Ohio and the law of the 50 States and the law of the United States in dealing with the obscenity as I understand, have used the term obscenity and not the term hardcore porno -- pornography nor have the decisions of any state or the decision of this United States Supreme Court at any times that the rule is with respect to hardcore pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.069" offset="11515695">Let us assume however for a moment that that was so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.222" offset="11532309">Pornography as I recall has its derivation at a Greek word which means, dealing with prostitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.133" offset="11559894">So, pornography is now all inclusive in the term obscenity because much obscenity deals with matters other than that which deals with prostitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.477" offset="11601272">However, in the instant case, Justice Radcliffe of the Ohio State Supreme Court in his majority opinion stated that this was worst than hardcore pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.008" offset="11671385">So, in order to be worst than hardcore pornography, he undoubtedly found that to be such.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.663" offset="11694059">I know of no rule of law that is reiterated more often in the reviewing courts than the rule that a reviewing court will not substitute its judgment for the finders of the fact where there is evidence to support that finding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3089.323" offset="12460701">Now, in Dayton, Ohio, this film was shown to a jury and the jury made a finding of guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.016" offset="12487450">However, the charge there was predicated under a misdemeanor statute of the -- of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.798" offset="12518588">This did not require scienter as did the felony statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.862" offset="12534784">An appeal was taken from the Dayton case, an affirmation was had in the Court of Appeals and when it got to the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court found the misdemeanor statute unconstitutional because of the lack of the scienter provision in keeping with the Smith case of this United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.939" offset="12627153">Now, the appellant argues that as interpreted, this statute was violative of the constitutional guarantees of the First and Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.135" offset="12683891">As part of his argument, he cites the Mapp case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.345" offset="12704789">The Mapp case was a case wherein the question of possession of obscenity was an issue and Miss Mapp was found guilty and upon appeal to the United States Supreme Court for another reason involving search and seizure, a reversal was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.299" offset="12788590">This Court did not pass upon the question of obscenity in the Mapp case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.794" offset="12810533">However, the facts of the Mapp case were such that they concerned -- were concerned with mere possession as opposed to possession for commercial purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.574" offset="12865703">The appellant contends that in the Mapp case, there was a lack of guilty purpose or mens rea announced by the Court as an element of the obscenity law of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.095" offset="12939786">The Mapp case did not say that guilty purpose was not a necessary element.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.343" offset="12964760">The Mapp case merely concerned itself with a factual situation of a mere possession knowledgeable but not a possession for commercial purposes or for -- with a guilty purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.736" offset="13026304">In the instant case, we are concerned with a knowing possession for the purposes of public exhibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.171" offset="13064025">State versus Mapp did not foreclose the ban on possession for purposes of exhibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.253" offset="13088371">Again, for purposes of clarification may I say that four out of the six charges in the Mapp case found that as applied to the Mapp -- Mapp facts, the statute to be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.273" offset="13148453">Though, four out of the six so found that this is not sufficient in Ohio to make a law unconstitutional, the reason being that it is necessary in an appeal from a lower tribunal that all but one of the justices must find it to be unconstitutional in order to make a statute unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.934" offset="13255137">In Alberts versus California passed upon by this Court, this Court found the constitutionality of a state statute which provided for the lewdly keeping or sale of obscene materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.104" offset="13315741">Much more so, the constitution of -- constitutionality of the Ohio statute should be upheld for prohibiting the knowing possession, the control and the knowing exhibition of obscene motion picture films.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.452" offset="13389197">Mapp is generally in point only and that it deals with the question of this statute whereas State versus Jacobellis which is the State case of this case before this Court now and State versus Wetzel, W-E-T-Z-E-L which was decided at the same time is specifically in point and this clearly gives the interpretation of the Ohio State Supreme Court relative to the construction of the Ohio statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.054" offset="13515630">There can be little doubt but that in the Mapp case when Justice Stewart said and Justice -- Justice Stewart said in Mapp, "I would however reverse the Judgment in this case because I am persuaded that the provisions of 2905.34 of the Ohio revised code upon which the petitioner's conviction was based is in the words of Mr. Justice Harlan not consistent with the rights of free thought and expression assured against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment."</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.342" offset="13688769">In this instance, the Justice had in mind a mere possession as opposed to a knowing possession for purposes of exhibition.</text>

            <label>Mr. John T. Corrigan</label>
            <text syncTime="3989.488" offset="16061315">In Ohio?</text>
            <text syncTime="3990.808" offset="16066644">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.019" offset="16067480">I have no idea Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.325" offset="16072704">In our -- in our jurisdiction perhaps, the whole gamut of obscenity in the course of the year, maybe a dozen to 15 such cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.176" offset="16128084">And with regard to motion picture films, this is the second since 1957, the other one was appealed to the Ohio State Supreme Court in a -- it was affirmed in that Court that appeal was not taken to this Court with regard to other type of material, literature, as I say, maybe as many as a dozen a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="4035.935" offset="16247097">The majority -- the vast majority dealing with pictures and magazines depicting sexual activities between both female and males and in most instances, these are not appealed and in most instances, I might add a -- a plea of guilty as the result rather than a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="4066.036" offset="16367470">But I would say that there -- in a given year probably or not in excess of 15 in Cuyahoga County which has a population of approximately 1,700,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.606" offset="16425775">Moving on to the second point of the appellant's argument and I submit that this should not be before the Court or in the jurisdictional statement, the appellant did not set forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4094.285" offset="16480528">This is one of the bases of his appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4097.460" offset="16493171">For the first time, he submits to the Court for its consideration the entire statute and the -- the constitutionality are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.854" offset="16534758">When I submit that the constitutionality of a statute should never be tested in the abstract, and only in the -- with respect to the legal rights of litigants, should it be adjudged?</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.448" offset="16593168">However, out of an abundance of caution, I would like to address myself to this point, the appellant argues that the statute is unconstitutional and the majority of its intended applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="4135.113" offset="16643845">And then he speculates and he engages in conjecture and as exceptions to the general rule that the Court will not go beyond the limits of the facts in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.982" offset="16683342">The appellant sets up three exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.825" offset="16694627">The first being with the statute and question has already been declared unconstitutional the vast majority of its intended applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.817" offset="16722631">This is not so here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.630" offset="16729840">This statute has not been found to be unconstitutional in any of its applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.559" offset="16749589">The second is, where the statute would have an inhibiting effect on expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.839" offset="16770696">For this exception, the appellant relies on Smith versus California which we distinguished because that lack the scienter provision which is in the Ohio law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4177.631" offset="16813850">He relies also on the Thornhill case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4180.380" offset="16824926">This we say is distinguishable because the finding against the defendant in that instance was in the general language of the statute and not by any specification of the evidence or any specific portion of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.206" offset="16888247">He further cites Herndon versus Lowry to support this position and I contend that this case is distinguished because here, the Court found the statute to be vague, so vague as to make a criminal and -- to make criminal and innocent utterance.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.747" offset="16970376">The third contention is that where the statute is left standing, it would not give fair warning of its prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4224.485" offset="17001305">Here, to support this position, the appellant in my opinion dissects the statute and he argues for example that the statute provides where a material is not wholly obscene but contains lewd and lascivious articles that violates the Roth rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="4243.542" offset="17077582">A reading of that statute sets forth that no one shall knowingly sell, give, lend away -- lend, give away a book, picture or film and so on which is obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.977" offset="17135261">And then it goes on and we states and no one shall give, lend away -- lend, give away a book, picture, film and so on not wholly obscene but containing lewd and lascivious material that purpose of this statute is that we conceivably could have a magazine that would have many articles in it and one of those articles could be most obscene and the rest of the magazine be devoted to wholesome material.</text>
            <text syncTime="4290.816" offset="17266604">Under the Ohio statute, an individual could be prosecuted for the exhibiting, selling of that obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.816" offset="17306624">I do not think that the Roth rule is a rule of quantity but rather a rule of quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.161" offset="17335986">You could not conceivably have a book that would be a hundred pages and 49 of which would be obscene and 51 not obscene and then say that therefore, this book could not be found obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="4324.959" offset="17403173">The appellant argues also that this section in part provides that no person shall -- shall give away -- show to a minor an obscene lewd or lascivious work.</text>
            <text syncTime="4342.204" offset="17472240">And in support of this -- this contention of the statute is unconstitutional, in this application, he cites Butler versus Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4353.840" offset="17518738">Butler versus Michigan was a case wherein you will recall where an adult was prosecuted for the possession of materials that would tend to the delinquency of a minor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4367.563" offset="17573595">The Ohio statute provides that an adult would be prosecuted if there was a sale to a minor not merely the possession or if there was a knowing exhibition of the material to a minor so Butler isn't -- not at all in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4389.062" offset="17659591">He says that this section is unconstitutional because it contravenes the Equal Protection Clause of the constitution and that it accepts from its application works of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.916" offset="17711000">This in fact is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4404.721" offset="17722284">It accepts from its application bona fide works of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.548" offset="17737540">Bona fide works of art are defined as being works of art that are not obscene.</text>

            <text syncTime="4452.084" offset="17911724">And with respect to the bona fide work of art coming from an association, the bona fide art association is defined as one in the law as an organization not in contravention with other sections of the law that deal with obscene language, nudism, obscenity, seduction, sodomy, wife slavery, adultery, fornication and the like.</text>
