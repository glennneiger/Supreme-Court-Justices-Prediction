            <text syncTime="13.306" offset="156609">At the Court's recess yesterday, we had proceeded with the respondent's argument to the point of examining the Law of Indiana as expressed in the McCrary case.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.810" offset="202585">And to resume that argument, I would like first simply to say that from the McCrary case, it is clearly established that the presence of a transcript is necessary to an appeal in the Supreme Court of Indiana and by transcript, we mean, the full blown transcript in its formal aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.365" offset="304880">It is also established in the Law of Indiana by the McCrary case that an indigent convicted prisoner goes to the Public Defender, and if the Public Defender refuses to accept his case, refuses to represent him, that prisoner is unable to obtain a transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="102.261" offset="512397">Is there an absolute right to counsel in the trial court in a post conviction remedy?</text>
            <text syncTime="106.538" offset="529533">In this case, the Public Defender did represent the petitioner in the trial court, in a coram nobis hearing.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nathan_levy" startTime="114.667" stopTime="254.459">
            <label>Mr. Nathan Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="114.667" offset="562030">I would say that it is an absolute right taking the older cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.118" offset="575822">I do not believe the question has been raised in recent years at least.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.185" offset="600064">Now, from the McCrary case, it may also be gathered that there is some form of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.312" offset="644577">It was used in the McCrary case and then after the Brown case was repeated in -- with slight changes in the Willoughby case.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.124" offset="687835">But it seems to us unnecessary to examine into that review at the present time unless the Court desires to hear upon it because it was not available to Brown and he, by admission of the State, had exhausted all state remedies available to him prior to the time that the Willoughby case was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.062" offset="783653">Now when we turn to Brown's own case, we have a slightly different treatment both by this Court and by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.799" offset="826598">When Brown first sought a writ of habeas corpus, it was denied him on the ground that he had failed to exhaust the state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.377" offset="872887">Then, Brown proceeded through the various steps that McCrary proceeded through, and finally came before this Court with a petition for writ of certiorari upon the denial by the Supreme Court of Indiana of a writ of mandate to the Lake Criminal Court to provide him counsel and a transcript and permit him to appeal from the denied petition for writ of error coram nobis.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.907" offset="1007052">In this Court, instead of setting aside the dismissal of his action and remanding as had been done in the McCrary case, the Court denied certiorari without prejudice to Brown's right to bring habeas corpus in the appropriate Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.578" offset="1097644">Now Brown did go into the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Indiana --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="254.459" stopTime="262.595">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="254.459" offset="1121259">Do you take the denial of the petition for certiorari without prejudice to mean as distinguished from a mere denial of certiorari?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nathan_levy" startTime="262.595" stopTime="368.672">
            <label>Mr. Nathan Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="262.595" offset="1153755">It seems to me that one of the great problems involved in this case is, as has been discussed in some of the preceding cases, the question of federalism and the abrasive, corrosive relationship with respect to the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.565" offset="1209657">The procedures, as I will attempt to show in my understanding of the Brown case, follow precisely the recommendations of the conference of Chief Justices with respect to such matters in the use of federal habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.914" offset="1270993">So that when Brown's case was in the Federal District Court of the Northern District of Indiana, the question arose as to whether or not his constitutional rights have been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.683" offset="1330134">We -- I think he filed on July 19th, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.440" offset="1353122">We were assigned to represent him on July 20th, 1961 and in the interval between the 20th and the 26th, when the order of the District Court was entered, two hearings were held, one, the original hearing and then at the request of the State of Indiana, another hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.969" offset="1431280">Now the Federal District Judge, having heard the case, wrote an opinion which is a part of the transcript, finding that Brown had been denied his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.166" offset="1488018">And the Federal District Judge, following the recommendations and rules of this Court, as established in an earlier Indiana case by chance, granted the State of Indiana time in which to correct the defect with respect to the constitutional rights of George Robert Brown.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_m_harlan2" startTime="368.672" stopTime="371.723">
            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="368.672" offset="1578088">You're talking about Irvin against Dowd?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nathan_levy" startTime="371.723" stopTime="437.612">
            <label>Mr. Nathan Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="371.723" offset="1590314">No, Your Honor, it was Cook against Dowd, another similar case in which this Court -- Cook's papers were destroyed each time that he prepared them and they were never sent up to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.544" offset="1649560">And when the Court decided that his rights have been taken away from him, this Court directed the Federal District Court from the Northern District of Indiana, South Bend Division, another judge city, to give the State of Indiana some time in which to permit him to have his appeal rather than to release him at once, so that the Federal District Court below in the Brown case followed very meticulously this rule, granted 90 days to the State of Indiana to attempt to correct this constitutional defect, the deprivation of the constitutional rights of George Robert Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.571" offset="1809638">I must also call the Court's attention that in the order, the court below indicated that additional time would be granted if desired by the State of Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.492" offset="1853315">Thus --</text>
