            <label>Mr. Louis B. Scheinman</label>
            <text syncTime="35.451" offset="245217">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.944" offset="267160">This is an appeal from an order on a divided decision of the New York Court of Appeals which held constitutional a statute in a condemnation proceeding and which statute was attacked in this case on the grounds that the notice provided therein was inadequate in order to comply with due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.176" offset="384084">For the reasons that the time that we have here today is short, I would like to forego speaking of the procedural aspects of this case and exactly how this case came to this Court except merely to point out that this was an action for an injunction brought by the plaintiff who was a riparian owner owning a home on the Neversink River.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.458" offset="489200">That the City of New York had acquired the right to divert that river in a condemnation proceeding brought in 1952 and that this claimant or rather this plaintiff here had no knowledge or notice of this proceeding whatsoever and brought this action for an injunction in 1959 after learning of the acquisition of her property or portion of her property by the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.479" offset="613334">The motion made here by the City of New York was for judgment on the pleadings and consequently all of the allegations of the complaint under New York law since this is a motion similar to the common law demurrer should be deemed true.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.382" offset="672893">There was a cross motion made by the plaintiff, the appellant here to dismiss the city's answer to the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.748" offset="710405">The Court of Appeals as I've said by a four-to-two decision held that the notice requirements of this statute were adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.133" offset="747917">Now, the notice provided in this condemnation statute was notice that had no personal service or any effort at personal service provided in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.061" offset="811656">The statute required in addition to publication in the city record which is the official publication of the City of New York and not a newspaper commonly read.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.200" offset="856168">It also provided for notice in two newspapers published in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.104" offset="879783">These properties are of course considerable distances outside of the territorial limits of New York City and this notice relating to city newspapers, is primarily for the information of city officials and New York City inhabitants.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.952" offset="947179">In any event, the appellee here has never claimed that the notice in the New York City newspapers was even designed to calculate in any way to give any notice to the local property owners, many of whom are more than a hundred miles away from New York City.</text>

            <label>Justice John M. Harlan</label>
            <text syncTime="253.896" offset="1118960">That's not claimed here to be significant as far as your problem is concerned.</text>

          <turn speaker="louis_b_scheinman" startTime="257.505" stopTime="518.563">
            <label>Mr. Louis B. Scheinman</label>
            <text syncTime="257.505" offset="1133380">No, it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.475" offset="1137246">And the city does not even claim it to be any form of notice that is significant insofar as property owners are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.765" offset="1166399">The remaining notice is that the notice of motion which the city is required to make in order to acquire this title be published in two newspapers located in the county in which the property is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.446" offset="1221151">And the briefs here have shown how the city has deliberately used the lack of definiteness in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.130" offset="1255842">The lack of any requirement that these newspapers be those published or having circulation in the area of the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.763" offset="1286457">But a -- just a general requirement that it'd be two newspapers in the county and I think the briefs have shown how the city has bypassed those newspapers which were like -- would possibly be likely to give notice in the area of the taking and has gone too far into the county to find small newspapers of limited circulation which could not possibly be expected or calculated to have any circulation whatever in the area of the taking in which to technically comply with this inadequate statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.189" offset="1420100">There is one other requirement for notice and that is that handbills be posted in 20 conspicuous places in the area of the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.295" offset="1456567">There are 20 places in the vicinity of the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.911" offset="1467016">I think that is the way the statute reads.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.297" offset="1476524">Now, that has been construed in this situation here to constitute 20 notices, the city actually posted 22 along a seven or eight miles stretch of river, which would naturally mean 14 to 16 miles of riverbanks.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.803" offset="1558549">And which stretch of river had no less than 96 numbered parcels shown on the city's maps.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.863" offset="1594807">That is 20 notices, 22 notices for 96 properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.398" offset="1612988">And we know that not counting the riparian properties, those which are on the river and have their frontage right in the river, there are a great number of properties upland from the river which property owners have deed rights in their deeds to bathe, swim and to fish and use the river for various recreational purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.922" offset="1707029">Altogether, we would estimate that there are approximately 200 properties that are affected in this Neversink riparian Section Number 4, that's a seven or eight mile stretch of river.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.937" offset="1755094">And for these 200 properties, there were only 20 notices, or 22 notices.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.947" offset="1783202">The city did not even attempt to post these notices in public places but instead published -- posted them on trees and poles along the river and this was done in January for a motion returnable in March.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.346" offset="1840776">And it was well known to the city that these properties in this area are -- some were occupied mainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.976" offset="1879228">I believe that -- I will say nothing further about the publication used here because of the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.206" offset="1904201">However, I do wish to point out that it is our position that even these posters and the city distinguishes between notice by publication and posting that even these posters are not in the least fit personal notice of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.037" offset="1975568">And that is that there is nothing personal with respect to these handbills that are posted up along the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.636" offset="2005870">The notice of motion is all that it is that is posted and that is all that it is that is published.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.409" offset="2033037">It does not contain the names of any of the property owners who are affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.538" offset="2049546">It does not advice them that there is anything that they have to do in order to ensure compensation for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.159" offset="2087999">There is a statute of limitations here whereby if their claim is not filed within three years from the date of the title vest, they are barred from any compensation whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.432" offset="2129063">And the city has waited for that statute of limitations to expire in a great many cases and has refused to make any compensation whatever to those who failed to file claims within that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="527.769" offset="2214431">It is not only conceivable Your Honor but it is a fact that a great many of the property owners did not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.644" offset="2241912">You take this particular property here which is 25 miles downstream from the location where the river has been diverted.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.967" offset="2275244">That is 25 miles downstream from the dam.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.114" offset="2287783">As the river travels downstream, it picks up waters from the tributaries so that despite the fact that there is a hundred percent or near a hundred percent diversion as the location of the dam, there was only approximately a 50% diversion at the location of this property here in Orange County.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.528" offset="2365524">A 50% diversion does not make such a diversion apparent to the eye a layman.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.084" offset="2395721">The height of the stream is still substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.011" offset="2415365">The thing that is drastically affected is its temperature, is its velocity of flow, is its carrying capacity, the fact that it no longer has a scoured and cleaned bottom but it's unable to carry silt or sedimentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.029" offset="2479522">Now the stream was, before the diversion, a fleshy stream, that is that -- had its times when it was high and when it was low.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.172" offset="2508048">It is really not possible for a layman to look at the river and to thereupon assume that there had been a diversion 25 miles upstream that -- it was a diversion by a municipality for water supply purposes and that it had to file a claim for compensation or was even entitled to compensation within any specified time.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.798" offset="2602611">There was no way that a layman would know that unless that person happened to hear about it in some fortuitous manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="733.762" offset="3038438">There was no question for that, the name and the address of this property owner was known to the city or could have been ascertained without any difficulty whatever.</text>

            <text syncTime="1299.096" offset="5299806">Well, I wouldn't say so, because this Court has said in a number of opinions if the nonresidents who live on property usually have a way of finding out things that are happening to their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.347" offset="5356753">Now, in this particular case, she owned the property in New York and according to the allegation of the complaint and the statements in the brief, she spend about two months -- two months every year at this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.598" offset="5405759">And its inconceivable to me how under those circumstances, she wouldn't hear about the construction of this huge reservoir and she wouldn't see this poster, and if she did see it, that she -- she wouldn't read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.257" offset="5456436">But I say under all other facts and circumstances, this notice is given, we bear in mind that we are acquiring limited inputs, the right to divert here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.113" offset="5491858">And under these peculiar circumstances particularly, the notice given here was legally sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.933" offset="5519130">Now, if I may address myself briefly to this newspaper -- these newspaper publications, the question was asked, I believe, by Justice Harlan, I believe it was in regard with the purpose of New York City papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.074" offset="5571688">One of the New York City papers that was published then was the New York Times, and of course it has a circulation outside of the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.318" offset="5604603">But I'm not stressing that so much as to indicate that -- I think it does have some tendency to give some notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.325" offset="5636681">But my friend, Mr. Scheinman here has suggested that we should've had picked out different local newspapers in Orange County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.605" offset="5669804">And now, it happened -- and that he suggested, we should have published to newspapers in the cities in Orange County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.480" offset="5693315">But this is what I suggest and that is, those were weekly newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.227" offset="5708257">It may be that their circulation wasn't as great as city newspapers might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.795" offset="5726542">But when people read these weekly newspapers, they're inclined to read them all the way through including legal notices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.060" offset="5755591">And when they read them, they start talking about them, to their friends and neighbors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.085" offset="5771682">So, the Court of Appeals found, the majority of the court did, that these were appropriate newspapers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1856.911" offset="7530977">With respect to the address, if the city would've merely mailed notices to each property owner at the location of the property, now Mr. Lee could not deny that it did not know the post office address at parcel number 424 which it had mapped on -- and placed on its maps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.694" offset="7602134">That property had a post office address, would've been no effort to find that one and a letter mailed to the claimant at that particular address would've certainly reached her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.949" offset="7651140">In any of event I say that this argument by the city at this point that it did not have the names, the addresses is truly not a fair argument for it to make for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.983" offset="7691264">What if it did have their addresses?</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.524" offset="7697429">Each and every one of their addresses in -- at the property and wherever else they live, it didn't send any notices to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.766" offset="7722402">No one received any mail from the City of New York as to this taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.977" offset="7739329">It sent notices to no one, not even people who lived right at the riparian property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.461" offset="7761168">So, consequently their argument now that they didn't have the name and addresses is truly a much belated excuse and that's not a reason for not mailing notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.926" offset="7795127">Certainly, with respect to Mr. Lee's statement that the newspapers were selected in Orange County because they were weekly newspapers and the two newspapers near this property, one just seven miles away and one published in the city eight miles away, both cities on either side of this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.806" offset="7866598">And having circulation in this area, the reason that they selected these small newspapers as -- he states 22 and 27 miles away was that the other newspapers were weekly, and these city newspapers were daily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.099" offset="7919783">Well, if we look and see what the City of New York did in adjoining Sullivan County, we see that even that argument is not a sincere one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.338" offset="7948727">In Sullivan County Section Number 3 runs three miles east of the county seat of Monticello which publishes three weekly newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.389" offset="7988955">Instead of publishing in those newspapers right in the vicinity of the taking and I might add that there were newspapers of both political faiths that that made any difference to the city selection of newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.078" offset="8031692">They went to the far western end of the county in Callicoon, a newspaper that until its editor run for assembly, I, living in Sullivan County did not even ever hear off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.370" offset="8072861">And also published in a Liberty Advisor which is a giveaway newspaper, it's not even sold.Now, this is in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.859" offset="8098774">It's a newspaper which just contains advertisements and a few -- a few of these canned stories and is not even sold for two cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.350" offset="8136808">It's just given away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.044" offset="8143600">And those of the newspapers of the City of New York used to give notice of this taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.772" offset="8162408">In these communities in Section Number 4, there were three communities, Cuddebackville, Huguenot, and -- the name of the other community is just staging for the moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.996" offset="8203368">Each of these communities have post offices, firehouses, grange halls, gas stations, the city posted no notices in any of these public places but stuck them up on trees in the wood -- in the middle of the winter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.021" offset="8255404">This notice may look pretty here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.890" offset="8262928">It's new and it's fresh and it's clean, but it doesn't quite look the same after it's been on a tree for long ago.</text>
