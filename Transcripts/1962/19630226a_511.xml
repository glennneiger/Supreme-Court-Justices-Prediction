            <text syncTime="32.818" offset="234663">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.106" offset="247829">This case raises the question first, whether the State of Texas denied the petitioner merely because he is poor, an adequate opportunity to sustain a plea of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.917" offset="299029">It raises beyond that, if in fact that’s what happened, made the State do this consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.805" offset="330585">The case is here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Criminal Appeals in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.386" offset="352946">Petitioner was convicted of the crime of felony theft of having stolen a coin collection valued at about $600 from his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.955" offset="395160">As habitual criminal, the sentence was laid.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.847" offset="410728">There is no issue here in regard whether the crime was committed or any matter of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.805" offset="434552">The entire issue here has to do with the proceedings to determine his plea that he was not guilty by reason of insanity or that he was insane at the time of the trial and therefore not competent to stand in the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.622" offset="481886">The facts with regard to that issue are these: Petitioner was arrested and incarcerated in October of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.590" offset="517726">He was indicted in February of 1961 and trial set for late April 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.400" offset="544998">Three weeks before trial, because the petitioner was indigent, the Court appointed an attorney to represent him.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.482" offset="577285">That attorney on April 21st, 1961, three days before the case was set for trial, made two motions for the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.855" offset="610826">In each motion, counsel recited that the petitioner was indigent, that he was without means to acquire expert assistance to sustain his plea of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.095" offset="655757">In one motion he asked that the petitioner be committed to a state mental hospital for examination and observation of his mental condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.710" offset="690239">In the other motion, he asked the Court to appoint a psychiatrist or that it provide funds to retain a psychiatrist to assist the defense in the trial of the case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Alan Wright</label>
            <text syncTime="177.335" offset="812701">I'd be very glad, Justice Stewart, to tell you that immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.726" offset="826284">The supplemental brief which was filed I think sometime in the end of last week, I saw it on Sunday, sets out two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.122" offset="851884">It sets out a report of a Dr. Hug, a state psychiatrist to examine the petitioner at the state penitentiary, the date is not shown in the supplemental brief, but the date was February 6th, as the original of this report indicates of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.462" offset="913220">Doctor Hug reports that the petitioner suffers from simple schizophrenia and that he has been not responsible or best partial responsible for his actions for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.784" offset="958464">Exhibit B of the supplemental brief, his statement, that under the statutory procedure which we have in Texas, the director of prisons has had the petitioner transferred from the state prison to the state mental hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.357" offset="1012799">Now, the Court asked, what effect does this have on this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="231.895" offset="1030980">In my view, Your Honor, it has none.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.658" offset="1046026">It does not make the case moot and this, I take it, was the only purpose for which a document of this sort might properly be brought before the Court at this late stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.872" offset="1086882">Petitioner still stands under a criminal conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.985" offset="1103287">He still is subject to being returned to prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.969" offset="1115199">In fact, the same statute under which he was transferred on I believe Thursday of last week to the mental hospital, Article 932-1 of the Code of Criminal Procedure goes on to provide in Section 15, that if at any time the director of the mental hospital finds that he has been cured or, and I think this maybe more important in this case, if he finds that the prisoner will not benefit from continued hospitalization, in that event, the prisoner shall be returned to penitentiary to serve the unexpired portion of the sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="294.481" offset="1281337">This -- a psychiatrist this time employed by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.638" offset="1293876">The State -- State's psychiatrist have now told us that the petitioner here was only partly or not at all responsible for his acts for many years and -- when did this alleged crime occurred?</text>

            <text syncTime="371.369" offset="1588851">There is a recent case, February -- 1959 of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in which on a petition for habeas corpus, it was undertaken to show that lately discovered evidence indicated that a person had been insane at the time of the act or at the time of the trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="429.756" offset="1822386">We have a statute in Texas which provides that if after convictions and during the time that an appeal is pending and that I take it this present time, there should be reason to suspect the sanity of the convicted person then the proceedings may be suspended and the person may be committed to a mental hospital until such time to see he is well.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.801" offset="1910575">But the statute is very clear, it's Article 932 (b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, Section 3, that during the period that the person is so confined, he is to be confined as a person charged with a criminal offense and that upon his release from the mental hospital, the criminal proceeding continues just as it would before.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.296" offset="2000541">Further in that connection, the Court of Criminal Appeals has held this is a matter which not -- may not be raised before yet, the case there is Gibbs versus Texas at 308 S.W.2d 515, where an application was made to the Court of Criminal Appeals in the case then pending before it that there was no reason to believe the prisoner is insane, and the Court of Criminal Appeals said this is not a matter for us, this is a matter only for the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1103.544" offset="4517595">If Dr. Dial's testimony as to the adequacy of training, being vital in determining the adequacy of the examination were not enough, we have in our brief at pages 10 to 14 listed a great many other authorities from Isaac Ray, a pioneer psychiatrist in 1838 down to the present, authorities both Psychiatric, Legal Judicial expressing the view that a general practitioner is not qualified to give expert testimony on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.021" offset="4651447">I hope on that that my view is very clear because it seems to me that the State has perhaps misunderstood what we're contending.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.564" offset="4729605">Whatever may be the desirable evidence rule, this is surely a matter which the States must regulate themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.858" offset="4750817">It is our contention that this evidence however much may have is not sufficient to provide what the Constitution does require and that is an adequate opportunity to sustain the plea of insanity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.542" offset="4801494">And so we say, what Dr. Compton testify if you want, but make available to the Court and the jury and defense counsel testimony of a person who is trained and who is able to give a truly expert opinion on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.143" offset="4863979">That we think was not present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.906" offset="4886967">If there were any further doubt as to Dr. Compton's testimony, I think that he perhaps gives the answer himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.698" offset="4922180">He demonstrates that he is not trained to make the determination of this kind when he had testified at page 135 of the record that he made the same sort of examination a psychiatrist would have made, except with regard to physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.359" offset="5000756">Now the record shows, the medical text show, judicial opinion show that the kind of examination he made would consist of only three things; a history, a history so incomplete that he did not find out that the petitioner had been adjudicated insane in 1924.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.570" offset="5077661">An inquiry as to whether the prisoner suffered from hallucinations, and simple test of orientations such as whether he knew who is the President of the United States, the record shows that this is not what psychiatrists do, that a psychiatric examination requires physical examination, intelligence test, electroencephalogram, test such the Rorschach test, as well as verbal test and a good many other varieties described in the record by Dr. Dial and described by other authorities in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.305" offset="5204616">On the assumption, arguendo that the examination which was made was not an adequate examination, what is the constitutional requirement here?</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.307" offset="5256652">On this point, there is very little law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.687" offset="5266160">The only case from this Court in point is U.S. Ex rel Smith v. Baldie and although both sides managed to find comfort in various parts of the language of the Smith case, in fact, the Smith case does not on any view control this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.638" offset="5341915">Smith was a habeas corpus action attacking a Pennsylvania conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.488" offset="5365321">In the Smith case, psychiatrist had testified, the state psychiatrist, Dr. Drayton, who unfortunately was probably insane at the time he testified and two psychiatrists called by the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.173" offset="5420074">The contention which was made in the Court of Appeals and here was that further psychiatrist should have been appointed in order to assist the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.792" offset="5470542">That contention was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.126" offset="5475871">There was doubt as to whether a proper request had been made even assuming the request had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.508" offset="5497396">This Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Reed said first, “We cannot say that the State has this duty by constitutional mandate” and this language is very comforting to the State, but the Court went on to say, the language which comforts petitioner, psychiatrist testified that suffices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.437" offset="5577122">And that I think puts Smith quite aside from our case, where there was no psychiatric testimony, unlike Smith, where there was testimony for both sides by a psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.179" offset="5628113">We find constitutional support for our position in three separate lines of argument which we hope converge the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.366" offset="5668864">The first is simply the Due Process Clause, that there is no fundamental fairness if a man is asked to stand trial without the kind of testimony which every professional group, every learned writer, a great many courts, legislatures more the half of the States say is necessary in order to determine whether or not he is sane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.664" offset="5757994">This is a proceeding so fundamentally unfair as to constitute a violation of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.752" offset="5786415">But we add specificity to that argument by looking to the right of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.152" offset="5824031">Surely here was a case as the Texas Court held in Ex parte Bush in 1958 where there was a constitutional right to counsel no matter what variation of Betts v. Brady one accepts, this was a case where counsel must to be appointed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.607" offset="5885785">What then does the right of counsel mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.999" offset="5903339">Surely it would not be enough to satisfy the requirements of Powell v. Alabama to name as counsel for an indigent, Mr. Lewis, though he's quite learned in the law because he's not a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.805" offset="5946598">It would not be enough to name a lawyer who does not do a competent job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.800" offset="5966555">Now, we didn't have either of those in our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.247" offset="5976377">The state in its brief refers to the able and astute counsel for the defendant, a Mr. Moore who was the trial counsel, I think fully merited those compliments in the best tradition of the profession representing a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.661" offset="6026010">But what is Mr. Moore to do as trial counsel for an indigent if he had been appointed to represent a deaf mute to use, Judge Biggs example, and had not been furnished with an interpreter, there is no way he could exercise this professional talents, no way in which he could provide effective assistance to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.742" offset="6110333">Similarly here, he is asked to defend a man where the -- virtually the only issue in the case is the issue of the man's insanity and he has to do it without any professional help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.958" offset="6155160">He has to do it without any testimony which even he can cross examine which is truly competent to qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.184" offset="6188074">Now it is true, as Mr. Justice Goldberg pointed out, that the trial counsel was able to obtain Dr. Dial, a professor of Psychology at Southern Methodist University obtained for the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.805" offset="6246588">It is true also that because of the action of the court, the examination by Dr. Dial was entirely an inadequate examination, a 20-minute examination from which he said he could draw no conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.009" offset="6291414">And the State in their brief suggest that since it is a principle of medical ethics that the indigent always have a call on doctors that the counsel should -- could surely have gone out and found a doctor, a psychiatrist to testify if he wanted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.030" offset="6347525">I think there is variety of answers, if the Court please, to that argument that this is to me is the most helpful answer to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.694" offset="6386186">It is also a principle of legal ethics that the indigent have a call on the services of lawyers and yet we do not ask that an indigent defendant go out and find his own lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.447" offset="6433207">The Constitution puts the responsibility on the trial court to obtain a lawyer to help the indigent defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.322" offset="6460688">And we argue similarly that it should not be for the Court appointed counsel to go out and beg and hunt for a doctor that if a doctor is a constitutional requirement then it is the Court, the impartial administrator of justice which should carry the duty of making the doctor available, not the counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.926" offset="6539055">Finally, if the Court please, we argue from the implications of Griffin v. Illinois where the opinion of Mr. Justice Black for a plurality of the Court said that there could be no equal justice where the kind of trial a man gets depends on the amount of money he has and this, I submit, is precisely the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.877" offset="6642918">No one doubts that a defendant of means in Texas will have psychiatric examination and psychiatric testimony even if there are as the State shows psychiatrists in only 34 of our 254 counties, the psychiatrist will be there if there is a wealthy defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.980" offset="6723271">And if the psychiatrist is there for the defendant the State somehow, I suggest, will have counsel there, a psychiatrist there also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.770" offset="6754408">The only reason there was not a psychiatrist testifying the case of State against Bush was because Bush was too poor to hire a psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.585" offset="6785755">And that --</text>

            <text syncTime="1670.979" offset="6787323">How far do you think those implications go?</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.188" offset="6796100">I suppose a man who is rich enough and I -- there are a good many rich men in Texas, he could get the very best psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.257" offset="6828387">He wouldn't be confined to Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.909" offset="6834970">He might -- they might -- the best one in the United States might by common consent be in New York or San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.482" offset="6861302">He could get him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.009" offset="6867362">In other words, the -- those implications don't -- you can't read the literal language of that sentence which you quoted from Griffin against Illinois to the -- for the extreme implications of the State's opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1703.381" offset="6916890">Mr. Justice Stewart, I can accept that sentence from Griffin at least as an expression of the ideal to which we strive of the practical problems of course are very difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.085" offset="6963702">But I think that we already have a set of answers in the decisions which have been worked out as to the right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.334" offset="6988675">The right to counsel for an indigent does not include the right to go to Wall Street and hire the most expensive lawyer available and yet, there is some bare minimum which it does require.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.250" offset="7024410">It does not mean that someone just out of law school with a freshly signed license who does an incompetent job will be enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.112" offset="7051786">Is it similar beyond there and I know of no rule by which one measures it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.038" offset="7067564">This I should think would be the answer with regards to psychiatric health.</text>

            <text syncTime="6138.693" offset="24658108">I was interested in Mr. Crow's reference to Smith v. Baldie as bearing on what should be done with this new last minute development.</text>
            <text syncTime="6149.454" offset="24701158">It has a bearing, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="6151.789" offset="24710562">As he pointed out to you in the Smith case after it had been decided in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="6156.776" offset="24730520">Information appeared that Dr. Drayton, the Psychiatrist who had testified that Smith was sane had himself been adjudicated insane and that the insanity was of a sort which was progressive from which you might reasonably have been inferred that Dr. Drayton had been insane at the time he said Smith was sane.</text>
            <text syncTime="6174.022" offset="24799483">Now on that showing, three members of this Court thought that the case should be remanded to, I take it, the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for a new trial of a habeas corpus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="6185.910" offset="24847026">A majority of this Court, six judges, held the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="6189.759" offset="24862386">Now I think, Mr. Justice Goldberg suggested that there was a distinction between these two and that here it is the sanity of the defendant by which we have no information while in Smith, it was the sanity of the Psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="6202.922" offset="24915048">Of course, there is a distinction, if I may suggest sir, it seems to me that the distinction, it cuts exactly the other way that there is more reason for a remand where the newly discovered evidence goes not to the facts which were tried by a jury and decided in the case but they go instead to the integrity of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="6224.819" offset="25002611">If for example, we had information that a trial judge had been insane at the time he conducted a trial, I would think this would be the strongest kind of case for saying it must go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="6235.766" offset="25046392">But here, we are asked to take the case back to decide the facts which the jury has once decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="6241.715" offset="25070216">We now have more information on which to decide them, but it is simply a question of the quantum of evidence rather than something which goes to the very heart of the process itself and so I regard Baldie isn't authoritative.</text>
            <text syncTime="6252.837" offset="25114728">This is the case properly here for decision by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6258.691" offset="25138134">The Chief Justice very kindly suggested that I not neglect to discuss the merits because of this other very interesting procedural question and I would like to say just a few words on that before I close if no further questions on the procedural question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6278.749" offset="25218382">There has been some discussion of Dr. Dial why there was not more time given for his examination, why we did not have him stay over in the afternoon, why he hadn't been brought down days before when the jury presumably was not confined on a hot room.</text>
            <text syncTime="6298.974" offset="25299257">I think that in part, this is a question of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6303.000" offset="25315349">The motion for appointment of the psychiatrist or for commitment to a mental institution was made and denied on Friday, April 21st.</text>
            <text syncTime="6311.649" offset="25349935">The case came on, on Monday April 24th.</text>
            <text syncTime="6314.673" offset="25362056">It was not until Friday that counsel knew that he was not going to get them to Court that to which he thought himself entitled and counsel then spent the weekend hunting for someone, anyone who would be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="6327.299" offset="25412524">Dr. Dial was found, did agree to come but the question is not that of time so much as it is that of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="6336.482" offset="25449305">If we had been paying Dr. Dial of fee, then we could have said to Dr. Dial then, “Please, stay over tonight after the court adjourns.</text>
            <text syncTime="6343.336" offset="25476681">You can make a complete examination.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6344.788" offset="25482533">But Dr. Dial was there as a matter of grace and Mr. Moore was entirely subject to what Dr. Dial wanted to do and was in no position to tell Dr. Dial what to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="6355.117" offset="25523806">If the motions had been granted, if the State had appointed a psychiatrist, the court had pointed the psychiatrist, of course we would not have had that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6364.301" offset="25560586">There has been something said also about the competence of Dr. Compton.</text>
            <text syncTime="6369.816" offset="25582634">I surely would not want to be understood as suggesting that Dr. Compton is not a competent physician.</text>

            <text syncTime="6488.361" offset="26056808">I think I should in closing say something in what has seemed to me the hardest question in the case or at least the hardest under the supplemental brief was filed and when we try rather imagine that the Court would put to me and that is, is there a limit to the doctrine which I am answering -- asking the Court to adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="6513.026" offset="26155447">If the Court were to say in this case that there is a constitutional duty to provide the psychiatrist, would the Court also have to say that there‘s a constitutional duty on the State to provide ballistic experts, accountants and writing experts, all those kinds of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="6531.733" offset="26230262">To that, my answer is two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="6536.483" offset="26249279">First, one can hope that or at least reasonably read the Constitution of the United States as saying, that the State is required to make available to those who were tried with the crime and who are poor, whatever kinds of expert assistance the State is able to afford for itself with the uneven struggle is not constitutional but I do not have to take that position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6565.458" offset="26365158">I don't believe because it seems to me there is a clear distinction between psychiatric testimony and testimony of the kinds which I have mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="6575.426" offset="26405073">The distinction in several ways; there is a distinction in the importance of this testimony where insanity is pleaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="6583.889" offset="26438928">This is usually the crucial issue in the case is other matters frequently are not so important.</text>
            <text syncTime="6591.104" offset="26467767">The other distinction, the one which is to me the more compelling; I believe that counsel can get along not equally, perhaps not desirably, but counsel can see that the jury learned something if the State has called a ballistics' expert or an accounting or an accountant or a handwriting expert because of these other kinds of matters it isn't simply a question of late testimony on each side.</text>
            <text syncTime="6619.373" offset="26580825">The State will have produced an expert and an able and devoted counsel can make himself expert enough perhaps to conduct intelligible cross examination and to see that the jury understands what the facts are.</text>
            <text syncTime="6631.790" offset="26630562">But here, there is never a person put on even who can be crossed examined who has the qualifications to be able to answer the questions, counsel would like to put.</text>
