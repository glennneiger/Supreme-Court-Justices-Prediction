            <text syncTime="18.161" offset="176044">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.022" offset="191509">This case is here on writ of certiorari from United States Court of Appeals from the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.877" offset="218885">Before this Court for review is the judgment of that Circuit, affirming a judgment of the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.934" offset="271130">The judgment affirmed by the Sixth Circuit denied petitioners, Negro residents of Memphis, Tennessee, an injunction against continued exclusion of Negroes from a large number of recreational facilities in the City of Memphis.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.615" offset="349811">However, that injunction, the judgment of the District Court rather, provided for desegregation of these recreational facilities on a gradual basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.648" offset="409997">Now, in providing for the gradual as opposed to the immediate enforcement of petitioners’ rights to the equal protection of the laws in this case, the courts below relied upon this Court's decision in the second Brown case, involving desegregation of public schools where this Court recognized that a delay might be permitted in the enforcement of the constitutional rights there involved once a start had been made upon a demonstration by the school authority that the resolution of specifically enumerated physical problems would make for a smoother transition from a segregated to a desegregated system.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.396" offset="629008">Now, before proceeding to a discussion of the facts in this case, I would just like to say briefly what our contentions are.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.708" offset="670177">Petitioners say, first, that their constitutional rights here to use the publicly owned and operated recreational facilities in this case should have been immediately enforced by the courts below because these are personal and present constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.858" offset="742797">Second, petitioners say that irrespective of whether the second Brown decision has any application beyond the area of schools, that decision has no applicability to the area of public recreation.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.624" offset="813850">And finally our contention is that even assuming for the purposes of this argument that the second Brown case would apply in the area of public recreation upon a demonstration of complex and difficult physical problems, the record here fails to justify the applicability of the principles of the second Brown case to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.902" offset="946970">Now this controversy presently --</text>

            <text syncTime="563.608" offset="2357791">The respondents here said to the District Court “Well now we are prepared to desegregate the fairground at the end of the year and we don't want to do that till the end of the year because concessionaires may lose money if Negroes go in and people stay away and so forth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="578.959" offset="2419231">And then they said we are prepared to desegregate the golf courses because several of the plaintiffs had gone to white golf courses and had been denied, even though they lived nearer to the white one and the District Court approved the desegregation of the fairground at the end of the year, six months later and the desegregation of seven golf courses over a three-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.206" offset="2520168">Now they have carried out that desegregation as I understand it and there is one more golf course according to their schedule, which in a record at page 94, where Galloway Golf Course is deemed to be desegregated on January 1, 1964 and then all golf courses.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.547" offset="2597595">Then they also said to the District Court, we are going to desegregate six parks to Negroes, referring to some of these playground facilities that we mentioned a moment ago, but no dates were given and as far as the record is concerned, those parks are still segregated.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.730" offset="2666245">Now they maybe able to say that they have segregated even some of those, but the fact is that the large numbers of facilities are still -- Negroes are still excluded to the large number of these facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.552" offset="2725595">Now the District Court after accepting that preliminary plan directed the defendants to bring in another plan in six months with regard to all these other facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.084" offset="2775751">Then the District Court stayed adjudication of the right of Negroes to go into Pink Palace on the other six days of the week, until such time as the respondents filed a suit for declaratory judgment in the Chancery Court of Shelby County as to the effect on the title of a city, the admission of Negroes to the Pink Palace regulars.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.740" offset="2882330">The respondents claim that they couldn't admit Negroes to the Pink Palace regularly, because this would violate a limitation in the deed to the city, which said that this property was given to the city to operate as a museum or art gallery for Whites only.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.592" offset="2953697">Now in violation of that restriction of course they've been admitting Negroes for number of years, but they claim that they would have to have this adjudicated first and they have filed a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.848" offset="3010748">The District Court gave them three months in which file it.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.966" offset="3023287">They filed that suit on September 1, 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.718" offset="3042200">There has been no answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.295" offset="3048573">Apparently, the grantor or his assign no longer exists, and nobody has answered that suit, it's just pending there and there is no real controversy obviously, but the District Court invoked the doctrine of abstention and said that he would stay this until that was determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.996" offset="3123388">But abstention was improperly applied there because the question before the District Court was whether Negroes could be excluded as long as the city was operating it and no matter how the State Court proceeding came out, the District Court would still have to determine that because what we're attacking was a policy of these respondents of excluding Negroes from these facilities, not a restriction in the deed because Negroes are being excluded from properties on which there was no such restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.426" offset="3245119">So it still has to determine that even if the State Court should for some reason on the Tenancy Law hold that restriction void.</text>

            <text syncTime="817.686" offset="3374164">That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.276" offset="3404466">Now the judgment below finally provided that the District Court would retain jurisdiction of this case for further orders and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.405" offset="3469040">However, the Petitioner's immediately appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit which affirmed the District Court's ruling, relying as District Court did on this Court's decision in the second Brown case.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.657" offset="3541974">Now our argument is as I have indicated that the Courts below erred in refusing to enjoin this admitted violation of a basic and fundamental constitutional right clearly established by prior decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.767" offset="3630477">Now prior to the Brown decision, this Court had firmly established that the right to equal protection of the law under the Fourteenth Amendment was a personal and present constitutional right and was always immediately enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.228" offset="3688260">In the Brown case, the Court recognized that with the desegregation of public school systems in all of the states in the South, which involved the unification of dual school systems into a single unitary non-racial system, obviously would be involved tremendous problems, and the Court therefore made an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.855" offset="3794840">And the Court indicated in Cooper against Aaron that this wasn't a general rule applicable to schools altogether that even in some school situation, the District Court might order the immediate admission of Negro children.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.350" offset="3848756">Now in the couple of cases that were here following Brown, this Court made it clear that state enforced racial segregation in public facilities were unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.188" offset="3900165">In Dawson against Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, which we cite in our brief, this Court affirmed the Fourth Circuit's decision so holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.278" offset="3944469">And there the City argued in their jurisdictional statement at page 19, the second Brown decision applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.501" offset="3973413">So this question is already been considered by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.517" offset="3985429">This Court didn't simply deny Certiorari there.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.619" offset="3997863">This Court considered that case although without argument and affirmed, so it obviously considered the contentions raised in the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.187" offset="4048123">Now even if the second Brown decision does have some applicability beyond public schools, we say that it doesn't apply to the area of public recreation because obviously public recreation is not as complex as the school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.421" offset="4133073">You don't have compulsory attendance, you don't have transportation of children, you don't have assignment of children, nobody has to go a public park.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.194" offset="4164106">You don't have overcrowding in one building like you would have in a school situation, you don't have a close supervision with the teacher in every class, one of these playgrounds would probably have one or at most two supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.573" offset="4217710">And all it's really involved in desegregation of public recreation like desegregation of the buses, the city wide system of transportation is the removal of the sign saying, Negroes here and Whites there, and a public announcement to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.973" offset="4279254">It's really all that's involved in desegregation of recreational facility.</text>

            <text syncTime="1064.035" offset="4359502">Yes, the record indicates that they are Negro; well, there are Negroes and Whites employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.681" offset="4382072">The Negroes are employed of course to work in the Negro parks, but they use the same administrative office I believe as their headquarters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.675" offset="4430033">To that extent it's integrated, that's way I read the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.792" offset="4450513">Now apart from precedent, we feel that there are strong policy considerations why this Court's decision in the second Brown case should be limited rather than expanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.631" offset="4513938">First of all, as I've said, the deliberate speed doctrine enunciated in the second Brown case is an anomaly with respect to personal and present constitutional rights, especially such highly prized rights as equal protection of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.781" offset="4586454">And then, this all deliberate speed doctrine with respect to the school has resulted in a mass of litigation around the school issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.228" offset="4628250">Some of these school cases have been pending for five and six years resulting in the admission of a handful of Negroes, all because of this -- what is deliberate speed, how fast and school board have to go, what we get is 12-year plans and pupil assignments and all of this resulting in about 7% of Negroes being desegregated in the last nine years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.140" offset="4723963">And then, the deliberate speed doctrine I think has been widely interpreted as substituting a doctrine of gradualism for the separate but equal doctrine in the area of race relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.987" offset="4783313">And certainly, it is extended from schools to parks where we will have in the enforcement of constitutional rights to Negroes is a gradualism in every area and instead of shortening any period of disquiet and confusion that would certainly lengthen the period of racial unrest and disturbance and then as I said on the whole, there has been a very little desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.084" offset="4903685">Now finally, as I've said before, there is nothing in this record to support the applicability of the principles in the second Brown decision to this case because there is not a single demonstration of any complex physical problem with which the respondent had to deal, which would require the application of that doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1374.769" offset="5602408">The question presented to the Court of Appeals was purely and simply a question of law in our court, whether the decision in the second school desegregation case, Brown against Board of Education, which contemplates allowing a delay in the desegregation of public elementary and secondary schools is applicable in an action involving public recreational facilities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1972.610" offset="7993762">The proof was that the officials in-charge, after making their investigation, determined that the best way to remove the restrictions on the golf courses was to do it on a gradual basis and that plan was started and it is now almost complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.865" offset="8078817">A plan as I say was submitted to the Trial Court and approved with respect to the golf courses and with respect to other facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.689" offset="8114134">While I am on that, may it please the Court, the plan as submitted to the Trial Court for gradual desegregation did not embrace all of the facilities, and it was for that reason that the Trial Court ordered the Park Commission to submit a complete plan within six months, but before the plan could be submitted, the petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals, thereby staying the hand of the Trial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.463" offset="8229177">The plan was evolved, submitted to the Trial Court and it was not filed because of the suggestion of the Court, because its hand was stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.198" offset="8276198">It was printed in the public press so that all the world had notice of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.783" offset="8302529">It was given to the Court of Appeals on their request, the petitioners had the plan when it was submitted to the public press and the plan has been carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.253" offset="8344430">And in fact, in several instances it has been accelerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.485" offset="8361357">Now, I am not here to say that this plan is adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.291" offset="8372537">It may not be ten years maybe too long, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.152" offset="8391973">The Trial Court has never had an opportunity to adjudicate with reference to this plan because the appeal was taken before the court had an opportunity to determine whether or not it was adequate or whether or not it was the best plan, but I feel that we have gone as far as we can with respect to a complete plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.550" offset="8497612">So, that's the status of the six-month plan, but if I might go on further.</text>
