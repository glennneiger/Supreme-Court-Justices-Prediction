            <text syncTime="6.067" offset="127666">Mr. Price you may continue your argument.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="philip_price" startTime="10.705" stopTime="422.258">
            <label>Mr. Philip Price</label>
            <text syncTime="10.705" offset="146160">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.355" offset="152743">I think when we recessed yesterday I had just challenged the statement in that a bank has any control over its deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.759" offset="190360">I'd like to give two illustrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.729" offset="202271">Some years ago in Pennsylvania, the Secretary of Banking refused to permit any bank to allow more than 3% on --3% or 2.5% or 3% on its current deposits, at a time when New York allowed a half or 1% more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.199" offset="288162">Until the Secretary of Banking of Pennsylvania changed that regulation, $3 million moved out of the Philadelphia National Bank to New York without any power on the part of the bank to control that move.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.294" offset="340511">Another illustration; in New York City over a period of six months, a $150 million moved out, was withdrawn from term deposits of New York banks; because of a slight difference in the interest rate it was possible to earn a whole lot amount of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.717" offset="406235">That represented the amount of cash that would have provided commercial and industrial loans of $90 million and as for as demand deposits are concerned, of course by definition, they are withdrawable by the depositor without notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.591" offset="469765">Simply a check will withdraw all the money on demand deposit without prior notice to the bank and the bank has absolutely no control over it.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.386" offset="504874">Therefore, the number of deposits or the fact that the deposits does not constitute anything in the nature of control that is similar to the kind of control that we talk about when we were speaking of manufacturing company.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.895" offset="554924">There is no possibility therefore of the price war such as were suggested in the brief of the Appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.458" offset="581256">There is no power to control anyone because money is the only commodity that banks handle and that is fluent, it moves rapidly throughout the country at no cost and therefore, can be transferred from one city to another by mail, by telegraph and practically by telephone.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.239" offset="668296">Now the three functions of the commercial bank essentially involve the deposit activity and the lending activity and the collateral services that are rendered by the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.327" offset="720645">There is no competition, no price competition for deposits, because banks may not allow any interest except that which is permitted by law and regulations and that applies to everybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.744" offset="766307">So there can't be any advantage for one bank over another in that field.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.788" offset="786474">Banks have to operate within the limits prescribed by regulation, which amounts to the character of investments they may make, but loans have to be short term to be liquid, they may not be more than 10% of the capital surplus of the company -- of the bank, which means in a fact that they may not be more than about 1% of the aggregate deposits of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.276" offset="876440">Loans may not exceed 60% of the deposits ordinarily or about six times the capital of the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.098" offset="907786">60.5% must be kept on deposit with the Federal Reserve as cash reserve and an addition secondary reserve must be kept by the bank itself as a hedge against the possibility of sudden and unacceptable withdrawals.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.125" offset="967868">So that the operation of a bank is entirely different from any manufacturing company and its stock in trade, cash, is subject to withdrawal practically without notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.117" offset="1015829">The term deposits of course 30, 60, 90 days there was that much notice, but when the time runs out, the money maybe withdrawn without any explanation whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.560" offset="1057625">So far as deposits are concerned, there is no competition insofar as loans are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.618" offset="1081866">There are no price of competition in loans, because the interest rate is in effect fixed by the operations of the Federal Reserve in controlling the volume of money that's available to banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.764" offset="1134425">For example, the open market operations which the Federal Reserve buys and sells some $30 billion worth of government securities, can either withdraw cash from the banks and therefore reduce the capacity of the banks to lend or put cash into the banks when the Federal Reserve buys bonds, buys [Inaudible] and that makes money easier and therefore, interest rates might be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.778" offset="1246438">So that the control of interest rates is not in the hands of the bank stocks, but in the hands of Federal Reserve itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.931" offset="1275068">The aggregate money market in the United States, the free quick money market is in excess of $500 billion.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.370" offset="1312893">The amount that any one bank has under its capacity to lend is vastly less than that and therefore, it would be quite impossible for any bank to exercise any control over the money market so far as loans are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.365" offset="1380812">Now, I'd like to say a word about this -- operations of small bank in terms in relation to enlargement.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.495" offset="1417383">Within its resources, within its capacity to lend with 10% limit, the lending limit of the bank itself, a small bank can compete as effectively with a large bank as two large banks with one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.876" offset="1478928">That was justified too by all the witnesses who had any knowledge of the operations of banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.186" offset="1500139">And in that connection, I'd like to say a word about the foolishness referred to yesterday of the three banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.418" offset="1529083">It was suggested that the court below indicated that if this merger went through, it will be prepared to approve mergers indefinitely until we were reduced to three banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.632" offset="1569938">Nothing can be further from the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.927" offset="1579029">The three-bank question came up in this way, several witnesses testified that so far as out in to choices on the part of a borrower were concerned, that if a borrower were turned down by three banks, you probably didn't have a bankable loan and he'd have to go some place other than to a commercial bank to get a combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.349" offset="1672756">Therefore, the court below in determining whether or not there was any limitation upon competition here, in this case, considered that testimony about three banks and said that in those circumstances and the circumstances plus the evidence in the case, 17 banks in Philadelphia provided ample alternate choices for any perspective borrower for any possible banking need that he might have and that the 41 banks in the four-county area provided just that much more.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.064" offset="1823640">I was speaking only about banks not so all the court was speaking about in connection with those three.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.577" offset="1841716">They also going to get money from insurance companies, they get money from factors; they get money from other sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.163" offset="1863973">But speaking purely and simply of the commercial loan, still there were ample alternate choices for any needs of the average borrower.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.873" offset="1898872">As I -- Mr. Price, I understood Judge Loevinger's point about the three banks, it was this, that this merger would result in one bank having about a third of the business in this four-county area and if that was right for these two banks, then it would be right for other banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.249" offset="1968358">So you would end up with three banks in the four-county area, Philadelphia, assuming that the banks wanted to merge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1488.224" offset="6056312">This was not to monopolize, nor to insulate these banks from competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.447" offset="6085151">It was for a perfectly good business reason, mainly the whole Philadelphia business, which has been going to New York and to other cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.262" offset="6124440">The activities of the outside banks that is the bank's foreign to Pennsylvania or foreign to the Philadelphia area which come into Philadelphia, our legion, Judge Loevinger would have you to believe and his brief would have you believe that this is de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.863" offset="6202807">The footnote on page 10 on our brief indicates that in many, many, many places in this record where it is stated that Philadelphia fairly swarms with emissaries from outside banks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1601.844" offset="6510738">It was demonstrated and there are exhibits to show that business and industry have grown in the Philadelphia area in the last 10 years at just twice the rate that the bank's resources and the bank's lending limits have grown.</text>

            <text syncTime="2652.031" offset="10711542">He can change his depository right now by writing out a check for his balance and depositing them in the smallest bank in Washington and immediately he has affected a change and no matter how big the bank is, it couldn't control him at all in doing that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2718.971" offset="10979244">They say that would be 36% and in this if Your Honors please, I say is the touchtone of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.534" offset="11013517">If you look at page 18, it is a schedule of cities of over 100,000 populations with the concentration in the biggest bank in each as of June 30th, 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.166" offset="11112051">If we get down to Philadelphia, it is 79 and there we have inserted the concentration, which the Department of Justice claimed this bank will have after the merger and look there are 78 cities of 100,000 or more in the United States of America which have a higher concentration of banking assets in the lead bank in each of those cities than this bank would have after the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.770" offset="11242454">Well, now was there ever a better opportunity for the Department of Justice in any antitrust case to show, to predict what the effect of this concentration created by this merger would have on competition, what restraints it would produce?</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.541" offset="11325524">There they have 78 test tubes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.818" offset="11354676">They did not bring in a single witness from any one of those cites to say what the effect on competition in banking, this so-called concentration in the lead bank in each of those cities has.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.036" offset="11431476">I don't know whether they even looked into the test tubes, but if they looked they apparently didn't like what they found and the reason they didn't is because all the testimony in this case is to the contrary, namely that there is ample and active competition in banking in every one of those cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.007" offset="11527398">Now how can they come in here and say, sure we haven't produced anything to show what's going on in San Francisco, where they have a bank with 58.7% concentration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2877.004" offset="11611408">They don't say there is no competition in banking in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.993" offset="11647352">This great concentration in the lead bank in San Francisco is a restraint, while we know there is active competition in banking in San Francisco, but they haven't tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.210" offset="11688208">Look at Saint Paul, Minnesota 55.6% and in Duluth, Minnesota 44.7% and in Minneapolis, Minnesota 38.3%, all much higher concentrations than this merged bank will have and I assume that Judge Loevinger would have had ample opportunity and ability to produce witnesses from those three Minnesota cities to show if witnesses could be found to say that, “Oh yes, this concentration in the lead bank has completely blocked competition.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3992.450" offset="16073122">I call the Court's attention to the fact that the concentration ratio was essentially inverse to the size of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.594" offset="16101752">And that New York and Chicago as the Chief Justice noted are close to the [Inaudible] Now, it is true that we didn't call any people from all of these 100 communities, they mentioned Saint Paul, Minneapolis and Duluth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.187" offset="16144071">It might be of interest to know at the time of the trial, witnesses in those cities from the banks were being called before a grand jury and within the last two weeks we've returned three indictments and filed three civil antitrust suits in Saint Paul, Minneapolis and Duluth with respect to banking.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.398" offset="16200913">I don't think that they can make very much out of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4026.823" offset="16210631">As far as live witnesses, the fact is that the banks themselves called no live witnesses from the other six to eight banks in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.442" offset="16253158">They called banks only from small -- witnesses from small satellite banks that have large deposits or that held stock in one of the banks involved in the present merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.092" offset="16299760">Further, it is perfectly clear as we point in our reply brief that when these banks say that competition would be increased what they are saying is in the words of one of the witnesses, competition will get worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="4061.800" offset="16350542">We're going to have to work harder and compete harder in the face of the advantages of the merged bank in order to maintain our place.</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.891" offset="16382934">This is what they mean when they say that competition will be increased or competition will remain the same, because the merged bank will have so much of an advantage that the other banks will be at a disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="4080.485" offset="16425357">Now, it's true that we're resting on statistics to a large extent, but I take it that this means that what we are using is facts instead of speculation and I call the Court's attention to page 18 of our reply brief, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="4092.704" offset="16474154">There is all this talk about; you need a big lending limit in order to compete with the New York banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.850" offset="16498813">Now here are the -- according to the defendant's own exhibit, Exhibit 1 here are the amounts of loans in other cities that the New York banks have ranged according to size.</text>
            <text syncTime="4110.465" offset="16545207">And I call the Court's attention to the fact that of the cities that had more loans from New York banks, most of them have larger lending limits in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.331" offset="16580733">There is simply no relationship between this large lending limit and the amount of business done in a community by the New York banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.471" offset="16613230">That business done in a community by the New York banks is governed by the need for the specialized kind of services that the defendant's own witnesses testified they got from the New York banks in the international market with respect to specialized oil departments and other things of precisely this character.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.765" offset="16686477">Now, when you talk about business justification, the best example or the best evidence of what the business justification can be in this national multi-million dollar market is what it actually has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.153" offset="16743946">It's very easy for a banker to get up and say, well, we'd like to compete with the Bank of London and the Chase Manhattan and these big banks, we would love to be in this big market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4169.305" offset="16780622">What have they done?</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.250" offset="16788355">Both these banks here have ample lending limits and ample funds to get into the multi-million dollar market now and so, they can loan up to $6 million and $8 million respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.002" offset="16847391">There are $5 million or more loans amount to 9 in total number and $56 million in total amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="4194.443" offset="16881142">This is less than one one-hundredth of a percent of the total number of loans less than 6% of the total amount of loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.772" offset="16910503">So that for this market or submarket, they are going to sacrifice competition in the Philadelphia market and I submit that whatever the rule of reason may dictate in other situations that, that cannot be a sufficient business justification for this kind of a merger in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.974" offset="16987303">Now, Mr. Price has argued that there is a difference between banking and other types of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4226.954" offset="17011231">He has said that the difference between banking and other types of business is the significance of deposits, now precisely we concede exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.928" offset="17047071">It is perfectly true banks don't manufacture their raw material or their products as other businesses do, they are dependent on deposits and that is the -- but what Mr. Price or Mr. Littleton failed to do is to point out the significance of this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4248.628" offset="17097853">The significance of this fact is that when you combine banks controlling 36% of the deposits in Philadelphia, you have eliminated competition from 36% of the market in Philadelphia, because it is the deposits, which constitute the pool from which the loans are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.635" offset="17165876">This isn't a matter of one less out of 40 banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4268.983" offset="17179355">This is a matter of the credit pool from which loans can't be made, being combined in two massive chunks of 15 and 21%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.565" offset="17213628">So the 36% of it constitutes a single unified control and there isn't any question that they do in fact control the 36% of the deposits in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="4288.865" offset="17258872">It's perfectly obvious that the smaller banks are going to have their credit pool exhausted long before this massive bank that has more loans than all the 35 small banks and three times as many, as I recollect the 35 small banks, but together each one of these banks has more deposits than all the 35 small banks put together.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.491" offset="17345285">So that this isn't eliminating one bank, this is the equivalent of wiping out all 35 small banks in Philadelphia as active competitors in the loan pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="4320.766" offset="17386454">Mr. Clark or Justice Clark or Justice Brennan, I believe asked for the report of a Federal Reserve Board of Governors, this is worthy of a note.</text>
            <text syncTime="4328.510" offset="17417383">This is what the Federal Reserve Board of Governors said, and I quote, “The proposed consolidation of two of the three largest banks in the area would substantially less in both existing and potential competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="4341.475" offset="17469315">The resulting bank would obtain dominant position with pending competitive advantages which is strongly adverse to the preservation of the effective competition,” at page 2834.</text>
            <text syncTime="4352.773" offset="17514454">Now, it has been said that we called no witness from the Federal Reserve Board, it's perfectly true.</text>
            <text syncTime="4358.074" offset="17535666">No witness appeared for the comptroller either and it is significant, the Federal Reserve Board opinion is preceded by an extensive analysis with many facts with careful reasoning that leads up to the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4371.738" offset="17590314">The decision of the comptroller was simply as far as we can ascertain an oral decision rendered go ahead and merge boys and the only thing -- the comptroller held no hearings, the comptroller took no evidence aside from what was submitted to him by the advisory agencies and the banks, the comptroller wrote no opinion, the comptroller gave no reasons for his opinion and the only thing from the comptroller that appears is a letter of approval that appears at page 3049 that's dated February 28th, three days after this lawsuit was started, because it refers to the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.342" offset="17716746">So that if any weight is going to be given to the opinions of Federal Regulatory Agencies, I respectively submit that the Federal Reserve Board opinion on its face is entitled of vastly more weight than the opinion of the comptroller and that the conclusion that it comes to is indubitably the correct conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="4419.703" offset="17782157">And faced with that issue of whether or not in the minute, not minute, let me strike that from the record -- that in the national market for multimillion dollar loans, you are not entitled to give a questionable and small advantage to these banks at the expense of competition in the whole vast Philadelphia market.</text>

            <text syncTime="4531.188" offset="18228120">Mr. Littleton has argued before the Court and it's clear on the record that over 99% of the customers of both banks are borrowers -- of the borrowers are under $50,000 borrowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.423" offset="18273050">And therefore, by the clear and unequivocal testimony confined to the Philadelphia market, within that market the proposed, by their own statement, the proposed merger would combine 36% of the available credit pool into the control of a single bank and would deprive the customers of the alternatives presently before them with the division of this 36% between at least two banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4567.410" offset="18373047">So, I think that from the viewpoint of the customers, there can't be any question that there is a significant and substantial and important restraint or limitation upon competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="4795.982" offset="19287333">In fact, what the Federal Reserve Board does is set the so-called rediscount rate, which is essentially the rate at which the banks can borrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="4803.400" offset="19317008">Now it is indispensable to the influence upon the economy of this rediscount rate that the rates to private borrowers should flexible enough, so that they follow the rediscount rate move up and down as a Federal Reserve Board establishes the rediscount rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4819.401" offset="19380955">If there is monopoly or restraintive trade or other inflexibility in the banking system, then the banks cannot respond in moving their interest rates to follow the rediscount rates, so that the whole scheme of federal influence upon the economy falls.</text>
