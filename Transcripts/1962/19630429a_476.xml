            <label>Mr. Louis Eisenstein</label>
            <text syncTime="24.219" offset="200286">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.719" offset="214288">This case is an income tax case, which is here on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.677" offset="250128">There are three tax payers involved and the taxable year is 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.811" offset="278653">The asserted deficiencies come to about $500,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.792" offset="298506">The resolution of the dispute before the Court turns on the meaning and application of Section 117(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.346" offset="348766">Section 117(m) deals with tax avoidance through so called collapsible corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.409" offset="388995">This avoidance consists of realizing the everyday ordinary income from property as a capital gain through the device of incorporation and a disposition of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.440" offset="457122">In other words, the device is designed to take unfair advantage, as President Truman put it, of the difference between the ordinary income tax rates and the capital gain rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.192" offset="512188">I will now briefly summarize the relevant facts, which I gather are not in dispute, and then I will turn to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.144" offset="547924">The three tax payers are Benjamin Braunstein, Benjamin Neisloss, and Harry Neisloss.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.099" offset="579793">For many years starting in 1919, the Neisloss’s and then the Neisloss’s and Braunstein were engaged in holding and managing investments in real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.359" offset="632769">In the 1920’s, the Neisloss’s through corporation acquired an improved commercial properties, and they also purchased parcels of land for development.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.562" offset="681671">Then between 1930 and 1948, the Neisloss’s and then the Neisloss’s and Braunstein built, held, and operated multiple dwelling apartments and commercial properties all through corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.970" offset="767248">In every case, the stock as well as the underlying property was held as a long-term investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.209" offset="804237">In a number of instances the holdings were retained for as long as nine, ten, and 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.500" offset="837360">Five of the projects were multiple dwelling developments financed under Section 608 of the National Housing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.640" offset="877902">Now this case involves another FHA rental development.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.183" offset="900054">In March 1948, the taxpayers organized two corporations to build and operate a development known as Oakland Gardens.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.874" offset="942895">Each taxpayer owned a third of the common stock in each corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.138" offset="963897">Construction started in April, 1948 and the buildings were completed and ready for occupancy between September 1948 and June 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.582" offset="1013739">In May 1950, the taxpayers were approached by brokers on behalf of certain prospective purchasers.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.072" offset="1047698">In June 1950, the taxpayers agreed to sell their stock and the sale was eventually consummated through a sale of stock in November 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.700" offset="1098167">After the sale, the taxpayers remained active in the construction and operation of rental properties held as long-term investments.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.321" offset="1136619">They continued to own and operate four FHA developments, which had been built before Oakland Gardens.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.531" offset="1169533">They built a shopping center, a number of stores, and a large apartment house, and they also remodeled apartments all as a source of rental income.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.434" offset="1217076">They have never held rental property for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.976" offset="1247274">It is clear, if they had owned the development as individuals their profit on its disposition would have clearly been a capital gain and it is equally clear that the corporations did not hold the development for sale.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="301.520" offset="1309445">The Government agree with you on both of those, you mentioned?</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Eisenstein</label>
            <text syncTime="306.453" offset="1329194">We notice that in its brief in the Supreme Court the government has suggested that if we are right on the main issues then case should be remanded and I would gather that they mean a remanding with respect to this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.695" offset="1386141">But the Court of Appeals below very clearly assumed that the taxpayers would have been entitled to capital gain treatment if they had held the development as individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.862" offset="1426787">As a matter of fact, the whole opinion otherwise is an academic exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.997" offset="1459388">In short, the incorporation of the enterprise and the sale of stock did not enable the taxpayers to convert ordinary income into capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.762" offset="1506408">Each tax payer reported his profit on the sale as a long-term capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.047" offset="1527515">The commissioner determined that the profit was taxable as ordinary income under Section 117(m). Judge Kern, the trial judge dissented, I regret to say that the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the tax court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Eisenstein</label>
            <text syncTime="393.427" offset="1677040">Well, I think there are two explanations that can be given and I'm -- there is nothing in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.671" offset="1698043">One explanation is that the government regarded them as bona fide capital gain dispositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.041" offset="1723538">Secondly, 117(m) does not apply if the sale of stock occurs more than three years after construction is completed, and it maybe that in some of the other developments that is why the government did not pursue its present tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.347" offset="1800756">This Court granted certiorari limited to the question whether Section 117(m) applies where the stockholders would have been entitled to capital gain treatment if they had conducted the enterprise as individuals instead of through a corporation and I should add that the question is so limited is the question as it was precisely phrased by the government for the consideration of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.124" offset="1903888">The Fifth Circuit has resolved the same question in favor of the taxpayer in the Ivey case, in an opinion by Judge Wisdom concurred in by Judges Reeves and Cameron.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.028" offset="1951535">On the petition for certiorari, the Commissioner agreed that there is no essential difference between this case and the Ivey case that the two cases are squarely in conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.015" offset="2007437">I now turn to the statute, Section 117(m) which the Commissioner would apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.282" offset="2036485">This Statute is a segment of a comprehensive legislative scheme on capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.241" offset="2064384">It creates a special exception to the general long settled rule that a sale of stock is a conversion of a capital asset subject to the distinctive treatment of capital gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.569" offset="2121644">It provides that profit realized on a sale or exchange of stock in a collapsible corporation is taxable as ordinary income rather than capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.698" offset="2178173">A collapsible corporation is a very special kind of entity defined in paragraph two of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.041" offset="2215581">It is a corporation formed or availed off principally for the construction of property with a view to achieving two particular objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.295" offset="2256541">The first result that must be intended is the shareholders sale or exchange of stock in the corporation before the corporation itself realizes a substantial part of the net income to be derived from the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.571" offset="2321638">The second result that must be intended is the shareholders realization now, “gain attributable to such property.”</text>
            <text syncTime="563.774" offset="2358418">The question in this case comes down to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.704" offset="2374196">A collapsible corporation is a corporation used principally for constructing property with a view to the shareholder's realization of gain attributable to such property before the corporation itself realizes a substantial part of the net income to be derived from the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.705" offset="2454235">Was the profit realized by the taxpayers on the sale of their stock gain attributable to such property within the meaning of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="599.615" offset="2501883">It is our position that the profit realized here was not the gain contemplated by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.674" offset="2530095">We contend that gain attributable to the property within the meaning of the statute is gain which would be ordinary income from the property if the stockholders as individuals or the corporations had realized it in a normal course of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.150" offset="2603969">Here the profit would have clearly been a capital gain, not ordinary income, if the taxpayers had directly owned and sold the development or if the corporation itself had sold it.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.167" offset="2656005">There was no conversion of ordinary income here to incorporation and a sale of stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.202" offset="2688188">Now the Court of Appeals fully agreed with us in that there was no such avoidance here.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.662" offset="2713997">However, it then went on to hold that the critical language, “gain attributable to such property” means any kind of profit regardless of the nature of the profit and its relation to the enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.005" offset="2771362">This interpretation is directly contrary to the purpose of Congress as fully illuminated and spelled out by the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.501" offset="2813367">In fact, the Court of Appeals frankly indicated that its conclusion is not in accord with the stated purpose and policy of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.532" offset="2853491">As the legislative history plainly shows, this statute is solely concerned with profit which is a conversion of ordinary income from the property into capital gain through the deliberate use of a corporation of that purpose.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Eisenstein</label>
            <text syncTime="706.941" offset="2931127">The movie situation was one and as a matter of fact, the construction industry was another and I'm about to come to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.791" offset="2978565">I have indicated that the statute is solely concerned with gain which is a conversion of ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.398" offset="3008972">That is why the definition of a collapsible corporation is specifically geared to whether or not the corporation itself has realized a substantial part of the net income from the property before the sale of the stock, and that is why the definition is also geared to the specific purpose or motive which prompted the stockholders to construct the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.216" offset="3112208">As the expensive legislative history shows, before 1950, various taxpayers in the movie industry and the construction industry were converting ordinary income into capital gain through the calculated abuse of the corporate forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.577" offset="3177723">For example, if motion picture producer made a movie as an individual and rented the picture under the usual arrangement, his rental income was taxable as ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.766" offset="3222444">If he did the same through a corporation, the rental income was also taxable as ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.998" offset="3247313">In order to avoid such unpleasant results, a producer would setup a corporation to make a film.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.846" offset="3274794">Upon completing the film, he would liquidate the corporation and distribute the film to himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.055" offset="3303633">He would report the difference between the cost of his stock and the value of the film as a long-term capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.226" offset="3336234">He would then license the film as the corporation would have done and amortize the reported value of the film against the rental income.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.160" offset="3376044">In this way, the usual ordinary income from the property, that is the rental income, was converted into capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.932" offset="3407078">The same kind of practice developed in the construction industry where houses were built for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.605" offset="3449814">If a builder constructed and sold the houses himself, the profit on the sale was ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.680" offset="3478131">If he made the sale through a corporation, the profit was also ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.652" offset="3501955">Builders would convert this ordinary income into capital gain in one of two ways; they would sell the stock in the corporation or they would liquidate the corporation, report a capital gain based on the difference between the cost of their stock and the value of the houses and then sell the houses at the same price.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.329" offset="3588681">In either case, the content of the gain was profit normally realized as ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.668" offset="3618043">Congress enacted Section 117(m) to tax all such converted income from the constructed property in terms of its true economic content as ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.632" offset="3673945">The gain attributable to the property with which the statute is concerned is such converted ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.138" offset="3703933">That is why the statute treats the corporation as a mere contrivance to avoid tax, and that is why it treats the stockholder's profit as the ordinary income it essentially is.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.353" offset="3756805">The tax payer in this way is prevented from avoiding the tax that he should otherwise pay and rightfully pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.616" offset="3793795">Here as I have said, we do not have any such situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.216" offset="3808214">The profit was not a contrived substitute for ordinary income from the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.616" offset="3829844">The government has not been deprived of any revenue to which it would otherwise be entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.056" offset="3855548">In short, it is our position that a statute which is directed against avoidance should be carefully confined to those against whom it was directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.466" offset="3897240">It should not be applied indiscriminately as if it were a massacre.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.547" offset="3917511">Indeed as we pointed out in our brief, here the treasury is even better off than it would otherwise have been if the taxpayers had built and owned the property as individuals, because if they had done that then the assets would have been sold directly to the purchaser and the purchaser would have used as his basis for depreciation, his higher cost, which was not available to the purchaser here, because a corporation continued to own the development.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.671" offset="4038092">I should add that the Commissioner fully agrees with our understanding of Congress' purpose and then he pays no attention to what he says.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.532" offset="4077484">He fully agrees that the admitted and “basic purpose of the statute is to prevent the conversion of ordinary income into capital gain,” and he emphasizes, “that statutory language should be read, indeed even strained to some degree to avoid absurd results to carry out the discovered purposes of Congress and in general in an effort to produce a rational, sensible structure.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.705" offset="4198170">But having said all this, he nevertheless argues, as the Court of Appeals held that the statute applies regardless of whether the taxpayers realize the gain contemplated by Congress or regardless to put in another way of whether the result is absurd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.877" offset="4278836">However, even the Commissioner is unhappy with the Court of Appeals opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.612" offset="4301824">And so, he has tried to remedy the situation by arguing that any gain realized on a sale of constructed property as distinguished from purchased property is ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.073" offset="4363682">We cannot say frankly, we have studied the Commissioners brief, we cannot say how the Commissioner came to this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.904" offset="4399000">It seems to be a well kept secret.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.081" offset="4411747">However, even the Commissioner finally realizes that this strange argument will not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.210" offset="4444244">Therefore in the end, all he can say is that the statute taxes a gain as ordinary income whether or not it is a contrived conversion of ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.872" offset="4502862">We say that what the government has done is to make a travesty of the statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Eisenstein</label>
            <text syncTime="1133.922" offset="4639013">Well, I would like to address myself to that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.155" offset="4651969">That argument of course was not made by the Court of Appeals, which was fully aware of all these facts, because they are set forth in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.492" offset="4685302">The Commissioner's argument in that area is this; he argues that the proceeds realized on a sale of the stock represent a conversion of ordinary income attributable to their services to the corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.028" offset="4739532">As he puts it, by waiving the compensation for their services, the taxpayers were able to realize an amount over and above the cost of the development and a mortgage indebtedness, that's pretty much his language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.104" offset="4799822">Now this is a brand new argument, which has suddenly shown up here for the first time, it has never been made before and I should add that after he makes the argument, he dismisses it and says it is unessential and then he goes onto summarize what he considers is essential.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.249" offset="4868368">Now in making this new argument, the Commissioner overlooks a good many things, which are in the record, as well as things in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.670" offset="4910059">In the first place, Section 117(m) is concerned with a conversion of ordinary income from the constructed property not with the adequacy of compensation that may or may not have been paid to stockholders while the hearings indicate, that is the congressional hearings indicate that at times actors were receiving stock in collapsible corporations as compensation for their services, it is merely noted as an incidental byproduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.846" offset="5030745">In other words, they were being wrung in on what is otherwise a collapsible corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.165" offset="5056031">That does not relate however to the nature of a collapsible corporation itself, which is the conversion of ordinary income from the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.911" offset="5091035">The statute itself, I would like to emphasize, is expressly geared to the corporation's failure to realize the net income from the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.010" offset="5131368">At any rate, I want to add here no stock was received as compensation as is true in the actor's case and moreover the tax avoidance of actors has been separately dealt with in Section 117(a)(1)(c) which was enacted at the very same time that the collapsible statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.782" offset="5218513">The next point I would like to make is this; in any event the Corporations did not enable the taxpayers to avoid taxes that would otherwise have been due with respect to their services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.495" offset="5269400">If the taxpayers as individuals construct rental property, the profit realized on a later sale is a capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.875" offset="5302836">It is completely immaterial that the success of the enterprise maybe largely due to their personal efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.353" offset="5328750">Congress has made only one exception to that rule and as a matter of fact that was the rule that came in when the collapsible statute was enacted and that one exception relates to sales of copyrights, artistic compositions and similar property and even the proceeds realized on a sale of such assets are not taxed as compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.714" offset="5414222">They are taxed as the proceeds of a sale of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.242" offset="5428328">The next point overlooked by the Commissioner is this; that the proceeds realized on a sale of property are not determined by the services that happen to be contributed to the property or the value of those services or how much has been paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.746" offset="5490395">The amount received depends on market conditions at a particular time, which fluctuate from time to time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2285.872" offset="9246908">Paragraph three has limitations on the application of paragraph one and it provides -- well, there are three limitations, very briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.014" offset="9299466">The first one which isn't important here is, you have to own more than 10% of the stock and the third one limits these application to realization of gains on property within three years after completion of the property, which likewise is not involved here, but here is explanation I would suppose why the other corporations avoided this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.873" offset="9390895">The one we're concerned with is B, now that provides in the case of a gain realized by a shareholder upon his stock in a collapsible corporation, this subsection should not apply to the gain recognized during taxable year, unless more than 70% of such gain is attributable to the property so manufactured constructed or produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.272" offset="9476472">Now the relationship of that reference to the gain being the attributable property and that in the definition is simply that between they're anticipating the gain and their actual realization.</text>

            <text syncTime="2364.139" offset="9559960">Now their argument -- first of all, the phrase gain attributable to the property admittedly performs the function of confining this to gain that was caused or generated by the construction or creation of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.687" offset="9630072">There is no dispute about that, it serves that function, distinguishes gain that was so generated from gain that was created by various other factors, purchased property or in the case of manufacturing corporation simply the enhancement of value of its fixed assets or the existence of an antitrust claim, anything at all is distinguished by that phrase.</text>

            <text syncTime="2534.520" offset="10241442">Now, what they say is that the word gain also serves another function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.853" offset="10254817">It doesn't simply identify the source, the causal relationships, but is meant to limit the application of the statute to a certain kind of gain, one that reflects a converted ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.364" offset="10300792">Now first I would like to point out, that the statutes cannot be read that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.821" offset="10322631">And starting with paragraph one, which speaks of the gain in the sale or exchange of stock clearly refers simply to the excess of the proceeds over basis, simply the quantum of profit nothing else, nothing is about its character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.568" offset="10381667">And the provision, we're just looking at page 3B starts out that in case of the gain realized by a stockholder, i.e. on the sale of exchange of a stock, again that gain is necessarily to the excess of proceeds over basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.297" offset="10436524">The subsection are applied to the gain recognized during the -- unless more than 70% of such gain is attributable to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.511" offset="10481455">Now the gain there necessarily is a reference to the gain otherwise used in the same sentence to mean simply the excess of proceeds over basis and they refer only to the fraction of that gain, which is attributable to the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.144" offset="10543940">So you cannot read into gain any qualification about the kind of gain that it represents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.675" offset="10574033">Now more than that, I would like to suggest that the -- and even more serious problem with their suggested method of construing the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.694" offset="10622098">They would have you believe that it's not you simply substituted for the word gain something like converted ordinary income that is not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.573" offset="10649684">A great deal of baggage would have to go with that to spell out the test by which you decide whether a particular gain is a conversion of ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.738" offset="10686360">Now for one thing, I think in their brief they seem to acknowledge that it wouldn't be enough simply to ask whether the corporation would have had capital gain had it sold the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.748" offset="10734320">We've referred that occasionally, but generally to the emphasis on the stockholders and the reason the emphasis is on the stockholders is that at least one of the purpose is admittedly was to prevent stockholders who were themselves dealers in property from avoiding ordinary income treatment by putting each transaction into separate corporate shell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.618" offset="10821883">And, so necessarily it is not enough simply to look to how the corporation would treat the gain had it sold the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.054" offset="10855633">So, you have to go back and see how the stockholders would have treated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.364" offset="10876844">Now the question as to each stockholder I take it would be, if he had held the property would he have held it as primarily for sale in the ordinary course of traded business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.851" offset="10918745">Now, there is no more litigated question in the tax field when you hold property in the ordinary course of trader business hold it for sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="2719.376" offset="10980916">Well, that's right but there, I'm assuming that you would answer that question to hold that it would be capital gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2728.650" offset="11018010">I'm assuming that would be the answer, but I would still like to point to the complexity of the question, that you make the application of this statute turn upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.399" offset="11053014">Now simply stating a hypothetical question that you are going to answer is enough of an undertaking, but I'd like to emphasize particularly two further specific different problems that would be faced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.811" offset="11094601">First of all, all the stockholders need not to be in the same status, some of them might be dealers and others not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.998" offset="11119365">Now in this case all three stockholders have always joined together in all their ventures so they all can be viewed as one, but that would not always be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.645" offset="11153951">So what would you do?</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.461" offset="11157191">Would you have a separate treatment for the individual stockholder depending upon his status or would you say that if anyone of the stockholders was a dealer, the part would be tainted for all the stockholders?</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.232" offset="11212257">Now when Congress granted this kind of relief in 1958 what it did is it acknowledged this problem and said that if any stockholder owning more than 20% was a dealer or trader when the corporation is collapsible as to all stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.672" offset="11282056">It did not grant individualized treatment, as to -- if there was a 20% stockholder in that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.704" offset="11314239">For the second problem of the same kind is what do you do in making that, cited in that hypothetical question about other corporate ventures that the stockholders have engaged in of the same type.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.296" offset="11368573">You cannot ignore them because that would permit a dealer to avoid it simply by incorporating all of his ventures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.385" offset="11404936">Now again the 1958 amendments, when they granted this relief dealt with that problem and provide very complex formula how you take into account in deciding how property would have been characterized in the hands of an individual stockholder that stockholders, other corporate ventures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.649" offset="11474004">Very briefly if he is a 20% stockholder in this corporation, in the other corporation within the -- during which -- in which he held more than 20% of the stock during the past three years and the assets of which are the same kind you treat as though he conducted individually, but necessarily you would have to deal with that problem to articulate the test that the petitioners ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.640" offset="11593958">So I do not believe that even if there were mirror to their underlying argument on policy that it would be possible to read the statute the way they want you to read it, but I do want to deal with the questions of policies that they say are involved, specifically to show that this case does involve a conversion of ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.555" offset="11681625">I've shown that the statute by its terms is limited to corporations engaged in construction, manufacturing or production and all you have to do is make the policy judgment that the fruits of productive activity should be taxed as ordinary income to have a full explanation of the statute as concerned only with conversions of ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.062" offset="11779636">But this case in particular shows I think an extreme example of how we do covert ordinary income through construction efforts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3158.739" offset="12738330">In fact they were never intended to be performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.551" offset="12749615">I take it they were window dressing having something to do with the financing aspects of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.411" offset="12773021">The work was – they waived the architect's fees, the builder's fees, they waived their right to $4,100,000 in cash and performed the contract at their direct out of pocket cost, which turned out to be $3,800,000, that is to say, $300,000 less than the estimated direct cost apart from the architect's and builder's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.594" offset="12869778">Now those additional savings were attributable to fact that the estimates assume that they would use subcontractors to perform the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.227" offset="12904260">In fact the partnership performed itself the carpentry and plumbing and heating work without using subcontractors and thereby eliminated also the subcontractors market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.545" offset="12953579">That's the main source of the additional savings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.552" offset="12961625">Well whatever the source of the savings that normally the construction company would realize and not the owner of the building.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.260" offset="12996420">Now by that means they ended up, the corporation ended up with a building with a estimated reproduction cost and presumably value of $4.5 million for which it had to pay only $3,800,000, that is to say $700,000 less, and it is not surprising that a year later the stockholders were able to dispose of their stock for an amount closely approximating that $683,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.419" offset="13129017">Now the way they actually disposed of the stock, the buyer insisted that they drain off from the corporation all of its cash first so that they would have to pay less.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.146" offset="13171963">So the corporation first wrote up the value of the buildings by $750,000 to create a capital surplus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.000" offset="13207385">Out of the capital surplus they then distributed to the stockholders $410,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.102" offset="13231731">The stockholders then turned their stock over to the buyers for an additional $273,000 so they netted in the end $683,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.645" offset="13266004">Now we agree that for purposes of this case, the distribution to the corporation can basically be ignored and would be the same question, if they had simply sold it to the buyers for $683,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.356" offset="13320756">Now, I might suggest that what their gain represented, what generated their gain was simply the uncompensated services, that they contributed to the corporation in constructing the building by not charging for their services, they were able to create an equity in the corporation worth $700,000 and they cashed in on that equity by selling the stock, and I say that is precisely the kind of thing that Section 117(m), is designed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.395" offset="13464952">Now they say that isn't the purpose, they don't really deny that, that element is involved, but they say well we could have gotten away with that had we done it as individuals and that wasn't therefore the purpose of 117(m).</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.614" offset="13513853">I think the history shows that 117(m) was not focused simply upon the alternative ways that they might have done it and to prevent them doing something by corporations they couldn't have done without it, but rather was focused upon the basic nature of the transaction and how it should be taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.738" offset="13578324">I think that's demonstrated by the movie example that prompted the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.533" offset="13597550">Now in the movie case Mr. Eisenstein has told you that if an individual producer produced a movie and leased it, he would have received ordinary income, well that's quite right, an individual builder built a house and leased that he would receive ordinary income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.570" offset="13657631">He doesn't tell you what would happen if the individual producer made the movie purportedly for purposes of leasing, but then sold it and that producer would have exactly the same argument, I'm not saying that he would win, would have exactly the same argument for capital gains treatment on his sale, that these stockholders would have on their sale individually of the buildings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.191" offset="13756165">So the movie case is an exact parallel, at least prior to the 1950 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.330" offset="13788662">Now in 1950 Act as we pointed out in our brief, another change was also made at the statute, which accepted from the capital assets definition copyrights and artistic works in the hand of the person whose personal efforts created.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.896" offset="13874970">Maybe we acknowledge that, that might reach movies in the hands of an individual producer after 1950.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.852" offset="13902764">My first answer is that there is nothing to suggest that Congress when it was looking to 117(m) related its judgment there to what was going on in its amendment to the other section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.455" offset="13957204">And in fact they never brought together in their development.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.139" offset="13975907">President's message just talks about the movie problem, the hearing they weren't brought together, and the capital asset definition exclusion doesn't refer to movies, the history doesn't refer to movies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.096" offset="14027734">There are serious problems in bringing movies within that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.787" offset="14042572">This revenue ruling, in 1955 that a movie produced by a corporation is not within that exception, because it wasn't produced by the corporation's personal efforts, but more than that it took the combined efforts of a large number of people, and a large investment, quite different from the writings of both.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.221" offset="14136299">I would also say that these two provisions were responses to very different inducements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.211" offset="14156257">What prompted the amendment to the capital asset definition was the Eisenhower ruling, ruling in 1958 that Eisenhower's book then General Eisenhower, “Crusade in Europe,” his proceeds from some of that received ordinary -- received capital gains treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.187" offset="14240162">Now I myself had questioned ruling, but what Congress did in this provision was to describe all of these things as loopholes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.274" offset="14276420">It doesn't detract at all from our notion that the products of personal efforts ought to be taxed as ordinary income and something that allowed them to be taxed otherwise is a loophole, they were described as loopholes in the history of that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.314" offset="14332635">Granted they didn't deal with the problem of builders constructing property with the personal efforts and then selling the property, but that's because I don't believe there was anything to bring that to Congress's attention, they were all done through corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.465" offset="14393240">Over that finally that the difference between a corporation and an individual, if there is a difference in the tax treatment and I don't agree -- I don't admit that there is, isn't entirely a fortuitous in it's application, because most of these things when they are done in large sizes can in fact only be done through corporations, and do a great deal more through corporation than you can in individual assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.972" offset="14519254">That doesn't deny that there is still some anomaly, if we can't correlate the treatment in the two cases and I would think one should strive to correlate them, but it doesn't mean that there is nothing of substance to the distinction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3627.541" offset="14613504">The petitioners I should say point out that prior to the adoption of regulations they found three rulings that they said private rulings are inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3638.894" offset="14658957">Actually we -- private rulings, I suggest simply are not authoritative of anything, and in fact those were not cleared with the Chief Counsel's Office, when it was cleared they stopped granting them, and they didn't grant them to other units of the same builders.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Eisenstein</label>
            <text syncTime="3662.772" offset="14754461">With the Court's indulgence at -- time at my disposal, I would merely like to address myself to two or three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.141" offset="14795943">The argument has been made that gain attributable to self constructed property, that is where you put your own talents and efforts into property, and constructing it is inherently ordinary income, and that is not the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.251" offset="14856338">And there are number of cases cited in our brief which have held over and over again that whether or not constructed property is rise to ordinary income or capital gain depends upon the purpose for which the property is held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.293" offset="14912554">Secondly in 1950 at the very time when 117(m) was enacted, Congress enacted 117(a)(1)(c), which specifically deals with a certain kind of property to which personal efforts are devoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.427" offset="14973053">And the committee report that time very clearly indicated that if you don't fall within that specific provision then the gain that you otherwise realize on the sale of your property gets capital gain treatment if it otherwise qualifies, regardless of how significant your services were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.493" offset="15057377">They specifically give an example of a photographic studio, and it's well settled in the light of the 1950 Act that the invention of a patent, which reflects the most unique ability that an individual can bring to property gives rise to capital gain if it is not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.816" offset="15134595">There is one other point I would like to make, and that is, that an impression seems to have been left by the government that because you have some intention to sell property if a purchaser comes along, therefore you are holding it for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, there again that is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.341" offset="15216724">There is a difference between selling rental property and actually actively being engaged in holding property for sale to customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.934" offset="15247130">And as a matter of fact in this particular case the evidence clearly indicates that no rental property was held for sale and it is specifically stipulated that the stock in this particular case was not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business.</text>
