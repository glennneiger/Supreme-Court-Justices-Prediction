            <text syncTime="21.324" offset="188688">New York is here in this Court, if the Court please, seeking to reverse a judgment and order of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which we believe has seriously infringed the sovereignty of the State of New York in the particularly important and delicate field of its right, its constitutional right to make reasonable rules and regulations in the administration of its criminal justice, and I believe, certainly, I hope that the statement of the history of the case were in itself practically be enough to demonstrate the correctness of our contention without any extended discussion of the principles of law which are involved because it would be, it seems to me unnecessarily a waste of time for me to argue the principles of law which have been laid down by this Court and have been written about and decided upon by this Court in a number instances which are in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.276" offset="504456">In 1942, three men were indicted by a grand jury in Kings County which is the famous Borough of Brooklyn, New York for the crime of murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.659" offset="553984">They were this respondent Noia, a man named Caminito and a man named Bonino.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.038" offset="579480">And the charge against them was that during the commission of a robbery, they had killed a man named (Inaudible) -- Hammeroff.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.076" offset="619708">They were put to trial and the only evidence which the People produced against them aside from the corpus delicti was the respective confession of each of the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.592" offset="681775">The confessions of each attack as being involuntary, as a product of police brutality and when the evidence was all in, the trial court charged the jury that this was the only evidence against each defendant, this confession and that the jury -- that the jury had to find the confession both voluntary beyond a reasonable doubt and true beyond a reasonable doubt and that the People's proof didn't reach that measure of quantity and quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.942" offset="823150">The respective defendant as to whom the People failed should be acquitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="272.402" offset="1192939">Bonino and Caminito each appealed first to the appellate division and they had an absolute right to do so because they had the funds to print the record and the brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="654.511" offset="2721416">Now, Your Honors, I realize the judges being men before they are judges and at the same time simultaneously men as they are judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.443" offset="2765093">This is not a very collatable situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.065" offset="2779617">Here are two men, Caminito and Bonino who are out on bail and for all intents and purposes are free.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.289" offset="2808560">And here is a man Noia who if I am successful on this appeal would have to go back to prison for the rest of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.443" offset="2845132">I have two answers for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.757" offset="2854431">One answer is that it's not a situation that I will make -- a situation he's making and that he failed to avail himself of his right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.019" offset="2891421">And the other is and if I'm seeing anything improper here, I hope somebody from the bench will stop me.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.612" offset="2921827">We would be ready to do here what we've done in other instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.249" offset="2936351">Not exactly like this but instances where there seems regardless of the question of guilt, there seems to be an inequity in the eventual treatment of two or more defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.514" offset="2989432">If this man, Noia will appear ever made an application to the Government of the State of New York for clemency, I'll work out some sort of result which would put him so far as it lays within our problem on a parity, on an equality with Bonino and Caminito.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.071" offset="3075636">I don't think its material to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.671" offset="3086085">I'm certainly not suggesting that as a price for the reversal of the order of the Second Circuit but in order to meet what I think was the real ground of decision by the majority in the court below, I'm saying to this Court as I've said to every court before whom I've appeared and I have a history of litigation of this case for years now that we don't like this situation either.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.144" offset="3195904">Even though it's not performed with the People of the State of New York, even though it is a situation which Noia brought upon himself by not appealing, we don't like it either.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.696" offset="3238118">Now to get back to the facts, it's only -- it was only after Caminito and Bonino had become the beneficiary for this good fortune that Noia bestirred himself into action.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.324" offset="3308648">He made a motion in the county court which was the original trial court to vacate the judgment of conviction against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.804" offset="3354624">Caminito made a more or less contemporaneous motion not only to vacate the judgment that had already been done but to dismiss the indictment against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.830" offset="3398719">The matter came on before a county judge and on some basis of natural justice because he couldn't find any reason in the law of coram nobis or any such avenues of relief in New York, the county judge granted the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.958" offset="3483251">That is to say he vacated the judgment as to Noia and he dismissed the indictment as to Caminito.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.079" offset="3519718">Well, we took an appeal to the Appellate Division which reversed and then the appeal went to the Court of Appeals and it think it is significant that in the Court of Appeals, Judge Fuld wrote for a unanimous court the opinions which Your Honors will find at pages 4 and 5 of my brief and I will merely summarize them.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.963" offset="3623267">They -- the Court of Appeals held first, there is no such thing as natural justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.835" offset="3650748">The criminal justice has to proceed according to law, and the laws of New York had very definite rules and avenues with respect to matters like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.210" offset="3696201">And secondly, that coram nobis which in New York has merged it into bloom in the late years since about 15 or 18 years ago in the historic case as a matter of Lyons against Goldstein, coram nobis would not lie because coram nobis is designed to bring to the attention of the court a matter of fact, a question of fact not known to the court or the defendant at the time the judgment was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.517" offset="3825455">Here, all that Noia was saying in effect -- I didn't take an appeal although I could have taken an appeal under New York law it's unjust to keep me in prison when my codefendants to all intention and purposes are out.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.632" offset="3885850">And Judge Fuld wrote the opinion which is I say Your Honors will find at pages 4 and 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.622" offset="3909883">I ask you to consider its importance in this aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.393" offset="3928900">Our Court of Appeals had the powerless condition of Noia as contrast to the relative freedom of his codefendants before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.003" offset="3967352">They are men at the same time that they are judges but they refused to depart from the law of New York, the law of coram nobis and the nonexistent law of natural justice and so they sustain us and the judgment against Bonino and the indictment against Caminito was reinstated.</text>
