            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="18.120" offset="175835">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.175" offset="196106">These two appeals bring before the Court a major government antitrust case involving air transportation between continental United States, the Canal Zone, and South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.894" offset="254934">The defendants are three.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.461" offset="265174">First, Pan American Airways which is the largest international air carrier in the world, its route extend over most of the globe, but for the purposes of this case it's enough to note that Pan American is the dominant air carrier between the United States, the Caribbean, and Central and South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.588" offset="349706">Somewhere from 66% to 85% of all passenger traffic to East and South American is carried by Pan American.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.462" offset="385233">It carries 50% of all the traffic to South America either alone or with the baggage.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.030" offset="415535">Pan American's view is always been, that it should be the only U.S. foreign air carrier, the chosen instrument and presumably it still adheres to that aspiration.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.638" offset="469974">The second defendant, W.R. Grace and Company, is a holding company with very diversified interest, but for present purposes, it's enough to note that it owns the Grace Line, the dominant steamship company between the United States and the west coast of South America, and has a large number of agencies itself along the west coast of South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.974" offset="575300">It carries today and has for most of the period of this suit I believe, carried simply from 81% to 94% of the steamship passenger traffic between the Eastern United States and Western South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.899" offset="634964">And it carried more than 50% of the freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.678" offset="654085">The third defendant is Pan American-Grace Airways, an airline whose routes as I shall show in more detail in a moment, extend from the Canal Zone along the west coast of South America, Panagra was formed by combination of Grace and Pan American, each owns 50% of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.562" offset="749589">And Panagra carries 50% to 75% of the passenger traffic flying under the U.S. flag from the United States to western South America.</text>

            <text syncTime="195.308" offset="884590">The heart of the Government's case is the charge that the combination in 1928 and 1929 of the emerging dominant air carrier between the United States and South America, with the company that controlled the dominant steamship lines to the west South America, along with certain ancillary understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.844" offset="982706">And particularly in view of the 50th division of control which gave either the power to block acts by Panagra was in its inception and in its subsequent operation an illegal combination in restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.133" offset="1055953">Most of the facts, I'm not disputed although some of the inferences are and in stating them in somewhat more detail, I think it would be helpful if the Court had in front of it the small map that is in a folder in the back of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.810" offset="1126588">This shows the airline routes as they are today but it's useful to explain them as they were earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.907" offset="1162951">In 19 -- the late 1920s and early 1930s, where the first period of rapid growth in air transportation, especially foreign air transportation and largely under subsidies from the Post Office for carrying mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.601" offset="1229824">The success of the U.S. flag carriers in south Latin America was regarded as having great diplomatic and commercial importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.491" offset="1273292">Late in 1927, Pan American began to plan the establishment of a complete system of air transportation, serving the Caribbean and Central and South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.236" offset="1324283">It started at Miami and then began to push south to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Barbados and Trinidad, and there it later extended its routes along the north and east coast of South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.220" offset="1388231">It acquired its only competitor, only U.S. competitor for air mail contracts with the approval of the Post Office Department and the qualified approval of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.962" offset="1435251">By qualified, it's approved.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.583" offset="1497736">Gradually, Pan American pushed its route south to Buenos Aires so that it came for our purposes to be a carrier from Florida to the Canal Zone and to the Caribbean Islands and then along the east coast of South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.740" offset="1574327">It's shown in the map in blue, as I said earlier, as it is today, but this will give you the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.049" offset="1607555">At the same time, Pan American was interested in exploiting the west coast of South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.100" offset="1639737">In 1927 and 1928, it was negotiating with foreign governments to secure landing and operating rights in the west coast countries, either directly or through subsidiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.435" offset="1693132">And the district judge found that at this time, Pan American was far ahead of any potential competitors in planning know how in the ordering of equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.323" offset="1740675">At the same time, Grace, which is I have explained had extensive agencies of steamship interest on the west coast of South America, was beginning to explore the possibilities of west coast air transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.769" offset="1798457">She commissioned the study of the routes, engaged in discussions with the Post Office Department about possible air mail contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.961" offset="1831267">And then in August and September of 1928, Pan American and Grace agreed to pull their interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.619" offset="1869824">The basic letters, out of which the combination emerged, appear in our brief at pages 8 to 10 in a footnote and they're also set forth in full in the District Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.429" offset="1929070">The initial step that's the letters describing, was for Grace and Pan American to for -- agreed to form a subsidiary to undertake airplane transportation in Peru under certain privileges that it'd been secured there and it was to contribute half of the stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.903" offset="2010990">Then it was also agreed in those letters, that Pan American or a holding company which at that time controls Pan American, was attempting to secure an air mail contract from our Post Office Department, to fly from the Canal Zone down to Santiago.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.658" offset="2077968">And it was agreed on the letter that if they got the contract and if Grace desired to come in, then Grace could come in on the 50/50 basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.467" offset="2117256">The contract was awarded to the holding company that controlled Pan American.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.279" offset="2140453">Grace did elect to come in and Panagra was formed with Grace and Pan American, each holding 50% of the stock, and it proceeded to take over their contract and to establish what has become the dominant airline on the west coast of South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.015" offset="2219447">You'll see that its routes are set forth in the -- shown on the map in the pink lines, whereas Pan American is the blue line, with Panagra, confined pretty much the west coast and south of the Canal Zone and Pan American on the east coast but going on north of the Canal Zone to bases in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1077.313" offset="4412583">And the result I think is that there was no likelihood but prior to 1938 that Panagra or anyone else could have gotten a route paralleling Pan American's route, north of the Canal Zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.410" offset="4488965">But in 1938, the policy changed with the passage of the creation of the Civil Aeronautics Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.065" offset="4519581">And at that time, Grace began to be anxious and so that was cutoff at the Canal Zone to get its own routes to the United States and it proposed Pan American that it'd be make an application.</text>

            <text syncTime="1152.382" offset="4712887">After the war, the CAB dismissed the application on the ground that it did not have power to order a carrier to make so an extensive change in its business as to start flying from the mainland to the Canal Zone in addition to what had there before have been a South American enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.440" offset="4801181">That case was carried up to the Second Circuit, the Second Circuit reversed and this Court issued certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="1195.296" offset="4884564">And the result was that Panagra was faced with no through route, it was dependent on connections of the Canal Zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.447" offset="4917164">And it had a competitor who had a right to fly through planes in a through route.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.551" offset="4937540">And where that litigation would end up that was then pending in this Court, no one could tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.257" offset="4964394">Faced with that condition, Panagra entered into a “through flight agreement” with Pan American.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.129" offset="4995845">Whereby Panagra planes, they now go on to New York through an agreement with the national, Panagra planes are flown to the U.S. mainland by Pan American pilots.</text>

            <text syncTime="1248.448" offset="5097200">And at this stage of Panagra settled the business dispute on those terms and did not press any further to litigation at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.453" offset="5153207">The CAB in 1947 and again in 1953, requested the Department of Justice to institute this litigation and it was instituted about 1953 pursuant to that request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.157" offset="5224051">The District Court made two main rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.488" offset="5249337">First, it held that the combination of Pan American and Grace informing Panagra and the subsequent division of territory, the east-west coast, were not illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.270" offset="5296462">So it ruled against us on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.160" offset="5308061">It went on to hold that Pan American subsequent use of its control of 50% of the stock of Panagra, to block Panagra's extension of its route to the United States in competition with Pan American.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.259" offset="5364381">A constituted monopolization in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, so it ruled and following that ruling, it added an order on requiring Pan American to divest itself of its 50% of the Panagra stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.741" offset="5434284">But otherwise, it dismissed the complaint so that Grace was left free to retain its 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.929" offset="5467094">The United States and Pan American have both appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.885" offset="5490918">I plan in my argument because there are more issues here than what can possibly cover in the time permitted to direct myself to our fundamental contention that this combination of the dominant steamship interest and the dominant air interest to form a controlled airline in the west coast of South America, was itself in its inception and subsequent operation, an illegal combination in restraint occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.479" offset="5617246">That of course would -- if I -- we are right in that, that would not only sustain the case so far as the order against Pan American goes but would require reversal so far as the order in favor of Grace goes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1530.462" offset="6225272">That was done after the Brown Shoe case had been argued orally and prior to the decision in the Brown Shoe case, and in our view, indeed the view of all the counsel, the Brown Shoe case is decisive here because this order does either dismiss the Government's case or order divestiture unqualifiedly and therefore it seems to us -- to be exactly likely question presented and decided in Brown Shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.650" offset="6349928">The other preliminary question that I should note is the question whether this action should have been in court at all or whether it was a proceeding that should have been brought before the Civil Aeronautics Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.283" offset="6404472">Pan American suggests somewhat faintly that the Federal Aviation Act gives air carriers a blanket immunity and that they are no longer subject to prosecution under any circumstances under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.300" offset="6480541">We think that's quite plainly wrong for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.326" offset="6500707">In the first place, this is not so detailed a system of regulation that one could find and -- an intention impliedly to repeal all earlier statutes and they could mean applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.479" offset="6557236">For example, with respect to foreign air carriers, there's no regulation of rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.241" offset="6580328">Second, the Federal Aviation Act does contain or authorize two specific kinds of exemptions from the antitrust law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.286" offset="6628498">And the specification for those -- of those specific exemptions it seems to us to imply as it's been held in other cases involving other Regulatory Acts indicate that no general blanket immunity is intended.</text>

            <text syncTime="1756.368" offset="7128795">The findings of the District Court, it seemed to us to make it plain, that the combination was put together partly for a business purpose but also with an intent of avoiding true competition and protecting the interest of Grace on the one hand, the other interest of Grace on the one hand and Pan American.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.947" offset="7215208">The District Court opinion appears in Volume 11 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.852" offset="7238823">And at page 5388, where you can find the judge saying, Grace was aware of the competitive potential of air transportation with its large steamship investments, so as Pan American aware of potential competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.444" offset="7301099">And then over on the next page, by joining with each other in a joint venture on the west coast, Grace on the one hand would be assured against the entry of an independent American airline competitor into its west coast demand and gain time to get experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.180" offset="7364106">Pan American on the other hand, would be substantially free from American flag competition in the rest of South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.430" offset="7393050">Their method of organization of the joint company appears calculated to give each negative control of the company in order to assure against possible treachery of the other to expand the operations of the company in competition with their respective independent line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.174" offset="7460028">Pan American has never denied as I understand it, that it was their intention that Panagra should not furnish competition with Pan American's own lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.718" offset="7514258">Grace in its argument here protest that Grace had no intention but to set up being a -- going business, but that seems to me hardly to have been the intention of its offices as they declared it at the time the combination was formed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.611" offset="7589804">For example, Iglehart then the President of the Grace -- of Grace have wrote to one of his close associates in 1930, this was just a few years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.979" offset="7635257">I've got Volume 2 -- 3, page 966 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.593" offset="7657723">We went into this business because we felt that in view of our big investment in steamers, we should become a party to this new branch of transportation which will yearly become more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.938" offset="7703176">And in 10 years, will be a real competitor of our steamers over a 968, a memorandum written a month later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.486" offset="7745285">He again says to an associate, “We went into the business because we felt that in 10 years from now, air transport would be a -- an important competitor of steamer transport in which we have so large investment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.889" offset="7802964">As I say, I think the aim was both to control potential competition but we do not mean to say that Grace was not anxious to have the airline investment succeed once it went into them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.714" offset="7858239">But to where it wished the two to progress is pretty well revealed in another letter which was written -- which appears on 969, a memorandum written by Iglehart to some of the subordinate officers of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.037" offset="7919470">I'm anxious as I know you are anxious to see the traffic airplanes built up in a very aggressive way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.366" offset="7944861">Then it goes on into some details.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.776" offset="7954474">Further down, why not talk over the idea with Mann, Carter and Young who are all here now and see whether you can get a practical suggestion, get hold of a man who would not only build up the air traffic but would build it up in a way which would not necessarily draw traffic from our steamship line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.617" offset="8025840">Then skipping a bit, I appreciate the fact that steamer and air traffic are competitors but I believe that by handling the whole matter as I've indicated, we may avoid the prejudice of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.748" offset="8074324">His notion of what was meant by avoid the prejudice of competition appears in a letter written in 1933, again to a company official, where he suggest you check up but I think you'll see that from a particular instance, I'm on 977 now, air rates are getting too low in comparison with steamship rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.706" offset="8170245">In other words, build them up but not so there's any real competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.889" offset="8186964">I think you might wish to have pushed, put all the facts before you, and see whether your Panagra rates now actually got too low.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.795" offset="8218520">And whether or not, there is in some way jacking them up, that suddenly or in a radical way gradually we know that these things can be done gradually without calling attention or creating any opposition, whereas they have done too quickly and they're likely to attract opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.639" offset="8289886">Compete but don't compete too vigorously and lets us control both where there could be more vigorous competition if the agents who are handling it were not subject to divided loyalties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2095.947" offset="8487163">How competition was actually restrained by this potentially restrictive arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.364" offset="8508792">First and between steamship and airline, between Grace and Panagra and then second, I will turn to the Pan American aspect of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.385" offset="8544946">Now the district judge, I really am coming to your question, the district judge said that this allegedly unlawful combination of airline and steamship interest, was not an unlawful combination because these two weren't competing in the same market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.705" offset="8626239">That conclusion seems to us not only to be plainly erroneous on the evidence but also to be based essentially on a misconception of the applicable legal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.280" offset="8676498">Airlines and steamships are alternative and therefore we say, competing methods for carrying passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.928" offset="8715055">The airline's share of passenger traffic has risen from a very small percentage, so that today -- and so did 1957, it was 84%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.964" offset="8771271">Now bearing in mind that shift and bearing it in mind that there are 250,000 travelers a year between the United States and South America, it seems to us that it defies common sense to suppose that there aren't a considerable number of those travelers, because of these travels are for pleasure, whose choice will not be affected by considerations balancing comfort, convenience, rates, time and other factors throwing them all into the pot, by the way, we all know that -- we and our friends do when you decide which way to go to Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.815" offset="8926647">But this is not just speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.348" offset="8936782">There's ample evidence of current competition, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.745" offset="8954337">My first answer is that even with respect to passenger traffic, there's ample evidence of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.941" offset="8983176">My second answer to your question and second submission with respect to this aspect of the case is that we want to be sure that the same thing doesn't happen with air freight with cargo in the day of cargo which is growing, that happened in the 1930s with respect to passenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.274" offset="9052453">So that it may be that most of the incidents with respect to passengers are in a sense path.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.429" offset="9081083">We think that that evidence is important with respect to the current competition for passenger but even more important because it shows the impossibility where you have a steamship company and an airline company for the same people to act for those conflicting interest the same way that independent agents or officers would represent those interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.389" offset="9192887">And there is as I shall show in the moment, a great opportunity, with respect to cargo where it's particularly important that this should not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.423" offset="9225070">Now, the evidence of competition with respect to passengers is the testimony of various witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.648" offset="9257984">Ferguson, the treasure of Pan Ameri -- Pan American was asked, “Does Pan American engaged in publicity efforts to sell passengers on the idea that an air trip is more pleasant than a sea trip?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.714" offset="9302183">“Oh I'm sure we do.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.549" offset="9309602">After some omissions, “do you consider that Pan American is in competition with the steamship lines?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.504" offset="9337396">“Very definitely, we are both trying to get the same market.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.760" offset="9358399">In addition, you will find many comments in the internal Grace correspondence cited in our reply brief, showing that the agents were all too aware of the competition that Panagra officers were frustrated because they felt that the agents were more loyal to the steamships than they were to the airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.085" offset="9447737">There was even one instance of a prospective passenger who went into in Grace Agency and he wanted to make a trip in a hurry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.344" offset="9480756">How's the fastest way I can get to the United States?</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.798" offset="9494549">And the agent got out all the folders for the steamship company and figured out to sailings and so forth and the man said, well, there's an airline.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.559" offset="9529657">Oh yes, but that's not as safe as a steamship but that was the -- this was inevitable in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.070" offset="9555675">Now, the Panagra officials -- many of them protested against it but I think the inherent part of the -- unavoidable part of the arrangement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2406.585" offset="9729755">But -- and I don't think that I can make a case except for some instances like that letter from Mr. Iglehart where there was a deliberate instructions to suppress it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.444" offset="9777194">But there was an inherent recognition especially down the line that if this shipment go or this passenger goes by water, Grace gets a hundred percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.465" offset="9821184">If he goes by air, Grace gets a much smaller percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.650" offset="9838007">And there was a problem of which commission would the agent get whether it goes one way or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.497" offset="9857337">And this it seems to us still exists as shown by the testimony from Ferguson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.579" offset="9881684">Now, with respect to cargo, the gross of air freight bids fair to become spectacular during the next three decades as the growth of passenger traffic was in the past.</text>

            <text syncTime="2512.477" offset="10153253">There is some authority to the contrary of that and I simply without making any concessions lay it to one side, I do not pitch my case upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.790" offset="10190555">Indeed, we've waived it in effect, our argument is that even though a company may go in and do this by itself, there are many things that you may do by yourself that you cannot go and do by combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.742" offset="10242382">And here, Grace got together with Pan American but Grace might or might not have been so successful doing it alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.907" offset="10274983">Pan American might have gotten in there ahead of Grace so they might both have been there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.890" offset="10294941">So that our case rests on the doing by combination, and of course this combination between the steamship and airline interest is only one aspect of it, the highly important one but only one aspect as the wholly illegal combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.064" offset="10371636">I was about to point out the potentialities of air cargo in 19 -- taking all airlines, in 1945, there were only 9 million revenue ton miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.350" offset="10432763">In 1961, a decade and a half later, there were 308 million revenue ton miles of air freight, a 30-fold, 34-fold increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.363" offset="10484799">Furthermore, the kinds of freight carried by airplane have -- it must be realized become very fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.152" offset="10520012">The record shows here that the freight carried by airplane to South America has included -- with South America has included such things as cattle, industrial machinery, automobiles, refrigerators, wearing apparel, bricks, onions and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.158" offset="10595976">It is a diverse service today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.765" offset="10614471">Finally, I should emphasize this part of the background that relative transportation cost which we'll realize of course when you stop the think are not to be determined simply by looking at the rates, the cost of handling, transshipment, warehousing, different forms of packaging and so forth, so that what is superficially non-competitive in the case of the rates, being in truth the competitive in that pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.618" offset="10725857">Now here, Grace's insistence that all airlines can't really compete for freight with steamships if -- which is its litigating position, if that is the company's commercial position, it seems to be -- us to be the best evidence in the world of the anti-competitive dangers of putting the same company in control of both steamers and airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.437" offset="10829093">Because the record has a great deal of testimony in it, about the competition that airlines can offer steamship transportations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.208" offset="10864201">Conwell, a cargo sales manager for Pan American was asked, “From your point of observation, would you say there is an active area of competition in the North America and South America trade between air carriers and ships?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.294" offset="10920521">Well yes, I believe there is an active area of competition between surface and air at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.207" offset="10948211">Carl Michael, the President and general manager of an oil cargo carrier serving the Caribbean and South America was asked whether there was an area of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.478" offset="10989275">Well, our particular face of operations I consider most definitely competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.031" offset="11011532">And he went on to list specific instances of competition between himself and the steamers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.997" offset="11035355">Riddle, the President of the Riddle Airline which does not serve Latin America apparently but which nevertheless is one of the biggest freight carriers testified too of his ability to compete and frequent competition with steamer transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.347" offset="11104737">And we set forth in our brief, references to gold and platinum shipments as specific illustrations of instances in which Panagra, for example got some gold shipments that had previously gone by Grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.073" offset="11175685">There was intercompany correspondents pointing out that if only they'd gone by water, Grace would have got a hundred percent of the revenue whereas going by air of Pan American got some and some U.S. domestic carrier got some.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.539" offset="11237543">So that there's ample testimony of instances in which there are competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.869" offset="11266800">Now, Grace says to this, as the district judge did, that while looking at the whole picture, the two really aren't competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.897" offset="11302954">In the case of passengers, there are great many people short of time and they'll only go by airline, water obviously isn't competitive as to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.877" offset="11338898">And he might have said and did say in effect that the shipments of grain, fertilizers, ores and so forth and of course the airlines don't cover to carry those.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.795" offset="11386546">And the result is that if you'd assume that all passengers once are interchangeable and that all freight is fungible, then you do find only a small part of the passengers going by water and only a very small part of the freight going by air relatively speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.579" offset="11473690">But it seems to us that there are number of fallacies in this contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.530" offset="11497514">In the first place, percentage figures based on the total freight or total passengers are meaningless because they're made up of all different kinds of freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.430" offset="11541086">And to talk about the way petroleum is carried and how much petroleum or grain isn't carried by air, doesn't bear on the extent of competition that there is for other kinds of traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.844" offset="11586748">So too, the total volume of traffic is to which there is a competition is not small indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.733" offset="11626350">Panagra carried 8 million revenue ton miles and had gross merit revenues of two and a half million from freight or cargo carriers during 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.372" offset="11680893">And if it's two and a half million that it carry, there must be a great deal more as to which there was a competition if it had been vigorously pressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.292" offset="11720495">The fundamental legal fallacy I think in counsel's argument is in attempting to focus attention at the extremes of a wide range of different kinds of cargo or different kinds of passengers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.189" offset="11800116">Undoubtedly, at one end of the range, there is cargo that will travel only by water and that the other end of the range is cargo or passengers that will travel only by air.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.888" offset="11850898">Now, if we were dealing with a situation and which there had been a number of competitive steamship -- number of competitive steamship company, and they were being merged into a unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.404" offset="11908995">And the question was whether that was a combination in restraint of trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.188" offset="11928116">It would not be an answer if they monopolize -- they combined a large part of the steamship market to say, oh well you might ship your grain or oil by airplane because for some purposes, the steamer market is the only one reasonably available to a lot of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.058" offset="11999587">But if you -- our concern with putting the -- what already is the dominant steamship company, together with the dominant airline and you ask is this kind of result in a lessening of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.675" offset="12058102">True, it may not directly lessen the competition with respect to the people who could travel only by water or the people who can travel only by air, or the cargo that can travel only one way or only the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.984" offset="12107316">But there's this band in the middle where they are interchangeable and this makes it proper to let -- to that band in the middle and say, is this a substantial restraint of interstate of foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.780" offset="12154441">And in this instance, we think quite plainly that we have shown that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.524" offset="12173458">I should emphasize that the view that competing forms of transportation ought not to be under common control, is very deeply embedded in our national policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.539" offset="12225494">One finds it in the Panama Canal Act applicable to all rail and water carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.657" offset="12245974">One finds it in the Motor Carrier Act applicable to railroad and motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.463" offset="12273246">One finds it in the Federal Aviation Act applicable to the acquisition of control of an air carrier by a form of surface transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.706" offset="12314206">And the Courts Of Appeals in approving Civil Aeronautics Board orders have frequently noted that there is competition between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.096" offset="12355793">Indeed, the Civil Aeronautics Board itself once refused Grace authority to establish an airline to the Caribbean on the ground that it would be expecting too much to assume that in that -- that that transportation company would be in a position to provide vigorous competition for its steamship interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.362" offset="12452864">Now, turning to the other half of the combination, we think that there was equally plainly an inherent tendency to restrain and an actual restraint of competition with respect to air transportation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.396" offset="12528933">First, the combination inclined and resulted in a division of territory with Pan American receiving the east coast of South America, you'll remember all the blue was down that side of the map, and Panagra receiving the west coast of South America.</text>

            <text syncTime="3330.418" offset="13425037">Now, the second place where a restraint in air competition was inherent in the setup and therefore unavoidable is in the commerce with Buenos Aires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.509" offset="13481357">Both airlines, Panagra and Pan American, run down the Buenos Aires.</text>
            <text syncTime="3351.310" offset="13508629">The shorter route by air miles is the Panagra route.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.541" offset="13537573">But we find a number of instances in which Panagra, a number of ways in which Panagra was kept from competing vigorously with respect to those flights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.590" offset="13585742">It couldn't have its own offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.192" offset="13596191">The maps that were put out in publicity by Pan American ostensibly for both a distortedly map showed the distance wrongly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.834" offset="13638719">Agents were even instructed on occasion to sell Pan American routing unless the travelers expressly requested Panagra.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.303" offset="13672573">Again, I'm not relying on these specific violations if I could call them that, but rather on the fact that this was an inescapable consequence of the basic and continuing arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.387" offset="13728893">Now, it is plain I think that in both its steamship and airline aspect that the combination tended to inhibit and did inhibit competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.304" offset="13772570">And the critical question I suppose becomes whether the combination is saved from illegality by its business success.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.538" offset="13805484">Our answer or answers very briefly to that, they're developed in the brief are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.930" offset="13831084">First, neither the court nor an agency can excuse a violation of the Sherman Act on the argument, well this is really been a good thing for the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.233" offset="13872253">Second, this combination plainly contemplated and accomplished a division of territory and the division of territory is a perceived violation of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.942" offset="13923140">Now, it said here, well this was a new enterprise and was an area which neither of us served before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.530" offset="13949471">But if the two companies or three companies, selling a new product in the Mississippi Valley were to say when you go and exploit the east coast and I'll go and exploit the west coast and neither of us will compete with the other perfectly or plainly even so it was a new product, that would be a combination or agreement in restraint of trade under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.188" offset="14044139">Third, we point out that no combination of such dominant firms as Pan American and Grace has ever been held justifiable under the Rule of Reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.842" offset="14094712">And fourth, we say even if the Rule of Reason does apply, even if one must weigh the business gains against the costs, still this combination must be condemned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.027" offset="14163466">Now, it must be remembered that whatever Post Office policy or the commercial necessity might have required in 1928, it certainly didn't require putting the dominant steamship interest in 50% control of what was to be the air carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.376" offset="14240893">And it certainly didn't require of combining the dominant steamship interest with the dominant airline interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.812" offset="14270568">And still is, we submit, did it require setting up an arrangement which would project this control way into the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.709" offset="14314245">And then all of those three counts, this went way beyond Post Office policy and way beyond anything that could be justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.807" offset="14346637">Now, I would like in my last minute or two, to go back to the question raised by Justice Black at the beginning of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.294" offset="14384567">It does seem to me here Mr. Justice, that this Court's decree and only this Court's decree can break up this illicit combination and there's no other agency that can deal with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.640" offset="14457919">That is why the case is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.421" offset="14469099">It is also true that if divestiture is ordered, nothing can or will frustrate unless Congress changes the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.114" offset="14507865">That decree, there will have to be divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.191" offset="14524165">And then the Civil Aeronautics Board and the President will get a fresh start so that the Court's decree to that extent would accomplish something that only a court decree can do and there's no question of its being set aside by anybody.</text>

            <label>Mr. David W. Peck</label>
            <text syncTime="4179.589" offset="16821687">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.790" offset="16838510">I think that to get true insight into and perspective on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4190.658" offset="16865991">One has to relate the complaint, the course of the trial and the result reached by the decree rendered.</text>
            <text syncTime="4201.519" offset="16909458">First, the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.011" offset="16919385">This complaint, not only in essence but its in entirety, was a claim that the two defendants were engaged in an illegal combination to restrain and monopolize trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="4220.600" offset="16985736">While Section 2 of the Sherman Act was mentioned, it is perfectly clear in the Government's briefs here, make it clear, that basically fundamentally to use the words of the Solicitor General and I say entirely, this is a Section 1 and 3 combination case as set forth in the complaint and that's all the Government's case ever was and as I read the Government's brief, all the Government's case is today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4255.802" offset="17126588">And that naturally follows from what the Solicitor General has told the Court, as to how this proceeding started.</text>
            <text syncTime="4262.327" offset="17152711">It started at the request of the Civil Aeronautics Board who ordered to divest both of these owners, at the same time and equally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4275.392" offset="17204955">And not only that, but in furtherance of a program that the CAB had in response to its responsibility for formulating the air pattern of American flag carriers and that was pursuant to a declaration of policy, going back many years and reiterated as recently as last year, that the traffic in the South America is too thin to support more than two American flag carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4308.079" offset="17335672">And therefore, the most fundamental preset of the CAB in this area of its jurisdiction is to say that there must be only two American flag carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.909" offset="17383006">There must not be three because to quote the CAB, to have more than two would be either a waste of public funds or private investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4331.220" offset="17428250">And therefore --</text>

            <text syncTime="4340.809" offset="17466598">The CAB has always considered that since granting a certificate to Braniff in 1946, that there are only two American flag carriers in the South America.</text>

            <text syncTime="4360.951" offset="17547160">And therefore their program was, that when these two owners were divested as the CAB hoped they would be, that the purchaser of the stock, and they would have considerable leverage in that matter, should be Braniff, the other airline carrier into South America so that then what you would have would be one airline Braniff pretty much going down one side, one airline Pan American pretty much going down the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="4393.810" offset="17678608">And then there might be any adjustments of routes that the CAB desired in between but there would be only two carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4401.953" offset="17711208">Now, there has been no suggestion, not a suggestion in this complaint, not a suggestion by the Government at the trial and I still do not find any suggestion from the Government, that there has been any unilateral restraint by Pan American alone in violation of Section 2 independently standing by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4430.987" offset="17827297">Or any desire upon anybody's part at any time, the CAB or the Government, even now, that Pan American alone should be divested.</text>

            <text syncTime="4494.143" offset="18079953">The Court permitted Grace to assume the role of a private plaintiff of its own right in this Government antitrust suit and allowed Grace to bring into the case the argument that the only violation here was a unilateral violation by Pan American alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="4522.400" offset="18193011">And the way the Court regarded this case can be noted from its opening sentence, very significant, I submit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.037" offset="18227493">The Court said this is only nominally an antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4537.070" offset="18251630">Actually, the Court said, this is a better family court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4542.380" offset="18272841">And then the Court proceeded to make the major of what I think is its many errors here, of treating this case really as if it were a divorce proceeding brought by Grace against Pan American and the issue is the custody of their child, Panagra.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.995" offset="18351313">And of what resulted?</text>
            <text syncTime="4564.678" offset="18362075">A finding that there has been no illegal combination here that the formation of Panagra, its organization, its joint ownership, that everything that these two defendants did jointly was perfectly alright.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.044" offset="18427591">But in one single respect, when it came to exercising what the Government acknowledges to be, the exercise of the normal incidence of ownership of Pan American's 50% ownership of the stock on the question of whether or not this joint venture should be extended to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4602.027" offset="18511496">In voting though, that Pan American was cast in the role of a unilateral Section 2 violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4611.036" offset="18547545">Now, I submit that this is not only grossly unfair to Pan American as I shall develop at the end of my argument, but more significant, an absolute and complete defeat of national policy in air transportation, international air transportation, as declared by the CAB, the agency of the Government with a responsibility for that air pact.</text>

            <text syncTime="4805.998" offset="19327352">After the Court came to that conclusion, then certainly, it should not have gone on with a case which is essentially a route matter and fall squarely within the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Grace versus the Civil Aeronautics Board referred to at some length in our briefs, in which the Court of Appeals said that this very subject of whether or not Panagra should be extended to the United States, and whether or not Pan American was justified in voting its stock the way it did on that subject, was a matter within the special expertise and responsibility of the CAB not merely primary but exclusive according to what this Court of Appeals specifically said in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4926.234" offset="19808319">There was no industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4928.255" offset="19816364">They were starting an entirely new field to talk about this in the terms of a joinder of competitors in some kind of a combination to restrain trade is just as far from the reality as you could get.</text>
            <text syncTime="4946.113" offset="19887835">This was a joinder of people to create something.</text>
            <text syncTime="4950.386" offset="19904867">And they had a third partner in it, they weren't the only partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="4956.028" offset="19927437">The United States Government was the third partner because to use the phrase appropriate to the airline industry, this company couldn't have gotten off the ground if the Government hadn't come along with a mail contract issued by the Post Office Department which paid their expenses, their revenues for years worth didn't amount to a quarter of what it cost to operate this airline.</text>
            <text syncTime="4990.620" offset="20065886">And consequently, as the District Court found, this was a three-way operation of the Government as much as them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5000.384" offset="20104861">And then the question why Pan American and Grace here, why Pan American is perfectly obvious, Pan American was an airline, a beginning airline as the District Court found, it had plans to have an air system throughout all of Latin America.</text>
            <text syncTime="5023.389" offset="20196916">It projected an airline down the east coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="5026.790" offset="20210500">It had already established one from the United States to the Canal Zone and had a mail contract for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5033.188" offset="20236100">It was going down the west coast of South America, and the only thing that happened, and of course I think this probably turned up to be its mistake in hindsight.</text>
            <text syncTime="5043.123" offset="20275911">But the only thing that happened is that instead of doing it alone as they originally intended to do on the west coast of South America, it joined with Grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="5052.129" offset="20311855">And the reason Grace, because in this difficult situation of getting this new industry started, Grace had business houses all along the west coast of South America, steamship lines for rescue operations and the like, and they made as the Court has observed and the Post Office Department observed at that time, a perfect combination to get American industry started in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.039" offset="20431496">If I may, let me just quote that Postmaster General which puts this matter in perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="5091.525" offset="20469426">He said, I would repeat that the contracting question, and this is the contract granted to Panagra and he went on to spell out why it was granted to Panagra.</text>
            <text syncTime="5103.314" offset="20516655">It was granted to Panagra despite the fact that there was a lower bidder, the Postmaster General said, it was granted to Panagra because Panagra represented the joinder of Pan American and Grace and their combined facilities were just what the country needed to get this airline started.</text>
            <text syncTime="5125.500" offset="20605367">Then they quote the Postmaster General, I would repeat, “That the contract in question is for a route most difficult to serve, at the same time a very great and far reaching importance, not only to the public but to the whole future of transportation by it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5256.834" offset="21130742">As I say it, so far as Pan American was concerned, all part of a single picture and it just took Grace as a partner in this part.</text>
            <text syncTime="5265.967" offset="21167208">Now, from the facts which I stated to the Court, I submit that the legality of this arrangement follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.332" offset="21200750">And that the District Court was entirely correct in that part of its decision in which it said that this joinder of these parties was a lawful combination with a legitimate end, that the division of territories understanding and I quote the District Court as to what understanding was, it was not to parallel each other's routes, was not unreasonable under the circumstances that the blending of these resources with the financial and diplomatic assistance of the Government pull to facilitate success of Panagra, the American entry on the west coast of South America that this was a sound arrangement for the establishment and development of American commercial aviation on the west coast useful to the community and consistent with the best interest of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="5331.148" offset="21428015">Now, I come only briefly to what the Solicitor General's argument as I understand it comes down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5339.488" offset="21461347">I have expressed it to the Court why I think obviously it cannot rest upon the premise that this was a joinder of dominant carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5352.626" offset="21513906">Certainly, there was no dominant airline.</text>
            <text syncTime="5355.553" offset="21525608">There was no airline industry at all at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5359.755" offset="21542431">On what the Government says in its brief, a more accurate picture of the argument and one more realistic and fair, although I think entirely untenable, is that, while these two companies were not competitors, that they were potential competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.165" offset="21628008">That Pan American might have gotten this airline alone, that's true, that Grace might have established the airline alone, I doubt that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5398.474" offset="21697285">But then as much as both of them might have done it, that that was a joinder of potential competitors and therefore, competition potentially was frustrated at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="5418.380" offset="21776906">Now in a word, why I think that argument cannot possibly be regarded as sound is that the logical, the full, the inevitable scope of it is, that there could never be any kind of a joint venture at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="5433.268" offset="21836466">Because any joint venture represents a joinder of potential competitors, it represents two people who want to go in to the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.590" offset="21881710">Speculative, psychologically speculative as to whether they might both go into it separately if they didn't go into it in partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="5453.442" offset="21917132">But I know of no case that holds or suggests that two people joining together to create a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5462.007" offset="21951404">Now, as distinguished from two competitors, existing competitors joining together to create a joint venture which of course can be an instrumentality of monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5471.929" offset="21991111">But I know of no case that lends any support to the suggestion that two people starting in on a brand new venture have got to do it along upon the risk that if they go into partnership and the business becomes successful that government will say you have to divest yourselves because you might have done it alone and therefore your joinder in the beginning was a joinder of potential competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.076" offset="22095705">I need not remind the Court that in this day and age of a vast investment nor enterprise that's required to start many new enterprises, the whole world of the underdeveloped countries for example, the necessity of partnerships to have the resources to start a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="5519.218" offset="22180237">I can't imagine anymore anti-enterprise or anti-endeavor of proposition and then the Government suggest as the predicate for its argument in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5533.315" offset="22236662">Now, I'm going to move to where I submit the District Court went terribly wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="5542.120" offset="22271875">In taking up, in deciding a case that was not brought, my first submission is that everything that the District Court found on the legality of this arrangement in the beginning, the legality of the joint formation, the joint ownership and the joint operation of Panagra in and of itself compelled a conclusion that there was nothing illegal in Pan American doing what the Government has acknowledge to be, the mere exercise of the normal incidence of its half ownership on the question of whether or not this joint venture should be extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="5589.161" offset="22460061">Now, I will try to state quite briefly what this controversy is that the District Court seized upon to make the basis of its finding against Pan American.</text>
            <text syncTime="5601.759" offset="22510425">It is a controversy that started in 1938 by Grace suggesting that Panagra be extended with a route of its own between the United States and the Canal Zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5621.818" offset="22590673">Let me state the consequence of that right off so that the Court will understand the importance that I'm going to develop this argument in a more detail later.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.792" offset="22634559">But the consequence of what they were talking about was not competition between Panagra and Pan American.</text>
            <text syncTime="5641.837" offset="22670712">The suggestion in substance was that Panagra replaced Pan American on this route and put Pan American out of business and let the joint venture taken over.</text>
            <text syncTime="5654.712" offset="22722226">And the reason I say that is the suggestion perfectly clear is because the uncontradicted evidence in this case and indeed the finding of the District Court is in accord with.</text>
            <text syncTime="5668.044" offset="22775515">That if Panagra had this route, it would get all the business, practically all the business that went over the Pan American line.</text>
            <text syncTime="5675.861" offset="22806862">For this obvious reason, that is, unless, and I emphasize unless, at the same time that Panagra got a route between the Canal and the United States, Pan American got a route from the Canal down the west coast of South America.</text>

            <text syncTime="5765.024" offset="23163486">Pan American had the route from the United States down to the Canal Zone where it connected with Panagra and took the traffic down the west coast of South America.</text>

            <text syncTime="5790.437" offset="23265155">Certainly, all of it from the United States down the west coast of South America and indeed most of it that goes from the United States down to the Canal Zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.991" offset="23299323">So what this partner was suggesting to its partner Pan American was, let's extend this joint venture to put you out of the business that you would start it first and which was the predicate of this whole venture.</text>
            <text syncTime="5816.221" offset="23368286">Now, Pan American naturally said no.</text>
            <text syncTime="5821.411" offset="23388975">And then in 1939, they reached an understanding, Grace at that time was complaining about the connecting service.</text>
            <text syncTime="5829.463" offset="23421262">They reached an understanding that if according to arbitrators, the connection wasn't sound then Pan American would consent to an application for a route of Panagra zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="5842.041" offset="23471522">Two years later, without any suggestion of anything being wrong with the connection, without any willingness to go to arbitration, Grace started agitating again.</text>
            <text syncTime="5854.014" offset="23519378">This is after -- as a concession from Pan American they had a man of their own elected president and general manager of the company, despite the fact that the agreement between the parties in the beginning was that Pan American was to run this airline and Grace was to supply the agencies in the west coast of South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="5876.298" offset="23608613">And in breach of the first agreement and that of the second agreement, in 1941, Grace filed this application of its own nominally in behalf of Panagra for this route and that ended in litigation by the decision of the Second Circuit in Grace versus the CAB, in which the Second Circuit said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5901.551" offset="23709550">The CAB had jurisdiction to entertain this application by Grace in behalf of Panagra.</text>
            <text syncTime="5911.331" offset="23748733">And if it were found by the CAB, that Pan American's opposition to this extension was actuated by fraud and illegality then the CAB upon that finding could issue a certificate to Panagra on Grace's application.</text>
            <text syncTime="5931.620" offset="23829817">And it was in that connection, in which it said that the issues presented there which are precisely the issues presented in this case if there is going to be any Section 2 case against Pan American law, precisely the issues which Grace have raised in this case, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said in that case, came within the exclusive jurisdiction of the CAB.</text>
            <text syncTime="5957.759" offset="23934412">Well then, I move ahead quickly to 1946, the Solicitor General said this matter in the litigation from -- for quite a while.</text>
            <text syncTime="5967.747" offset="23974327">And in 1946, Grace and Pan American and Panagra got together in what is perfectly clearly a settlement of this controversy in which it was finally agreed and approved by the CAB something which Pan American had been suggesting for years that Panagra planes on through flights fly over Pan American's routes as well as the Grace route.</text>
            <text syncTime="6005.201" offset="24124165">And that was approved by the CAB with a finding that no monopoly would thereby be involved in clear settlement of the controversies so everyone understood at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6019.047" offset="24179545">And without enlarging upon the argument, I want to tell the Court with emphasis despite the brevity that in our submission, the approval of that agreement by the CAB gave Pan American immunity under Section 414 of the Civil Aeronautics Act, not from all antitrust charges, not antitrust immunity as the Solicitor General said.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.574" offset="24293648">But immunity from its opposition to the extension of Panagra to the United States which is the only issue involved on this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6061.273" offset="24348505">Now the decision of the District Court against Pan American was based on the following claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="6069.877" offset="24382882">First, that Pan American had excluded Panagra from the United States Canal Zone market.</text>
            <text syncTime="6076.897" offset="24410990">Second, that it was not justified in doing so because the territorial agreement between the parties not to parallel each others routes, only run east and west and didn't run north and south.</text>
            <text syncTime="6093.597" offset="24477759">And third, it was not justified because Panagra was not a subsidiary of Pan American.</text>
            <text syncTime="6106.046" offset="24527600">The Court said that 1% would make all the difference in this case, that if they had 51%, the Court indicated it would have been alright to do what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="6116.083" offset="24567724">But that having only 50%, they couldn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6119.550" offset="24581622">I'm not going to enlarge upon that argument, I simply can't follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="6122.699" offset="24594160">I merely stated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6124.837" offset="24602728">And finally, and most importantly, that this exclusion of Panagra from this segment between the United States and the Canal Zone, gave Pan American a monopoly on that segment and in turn therefore a monopoly position in the United States South American traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="6151.068" offset="24707636">And I emphasize that and I'm going to read from the Government's brief on this because this is what the District Court's finding comes down to.</text>
            <text syncTime="6161.167" offset="24748074">I read from page 8 of the Government's response in this appeal that said, this holding, that is the holding against Pan American, was based upon findings of Pan American has been since 1928, the dominant air carrier on the Canal Zone United States segment of commerce with South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="6183.868" offset="24838875">That by using its 50% stock ownership in Panagra, Pan American prevented Panagra from entering that segment of commerce, that's all, and thereby -- thereby, maintained its dominance not only over air transportation between the United States and the Canal Zone but also between the United States and South America as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="6208.917" offset="24939081">Now, as briefly as I can and I hope time will allow, I will tell the Court why I think the District Court's decision was erroneous on each and everyone of those points.</text>
            <text syncTime="6222.101" offset="24991744">First, we say that there was no exclusion of Panagra from this segment that Pan American came on to the segment and these flying Panagra planes are flying over Pan American routes by virtue of the through flight agreement ever since 1946 pursuant to a recommendation made by Pan American going back to 1939.</text>

            <text syncTime="6256.442" offset="25129148">Secondly, there was no power to exclude Panagra from this segment by virtue of the Second Circuit's decision in CAB versus Grace, in which the Court of Appeals said, it is up to the CAB to determine the legality and the propriety of what Pan American is doing there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6281.597" offset="25229772">And unless the CAB held that they were justified in doing it, they couldn't do it and an application by Grace would be considered an application by Panagra.</text>
            <text syncTime="6293.923" offset="25279091">So we say that Pan American didn't have the power to exclude Panagra.</text>

            <text syncTime="6316.576" offset="25369684">Thirdly, about this agreement being on the east-west which had been the claim of Grace in the finding of the District Court inconsistently, the District Court says the agreement was that they should not parallel each other's routes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6333.531" offset="25437497">It said that their half ownership was setup so that this joint company would not enter into competition would be independent lines of the two parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="6342.935" offset="25475114">And yet, unaccountably, I can only say utterly unaccountably, the District Court finding following the suggestion of Grace says, the division, their understanding only run east and west, it didn't run north and south.</text>
            <text syncTime="6359.233" offset="25540315">Now, perfectly obviously I say, it ran north and south.</text>
            <text syncTime="6366.628" offset="25569886">Every consideration, every single consideration for this non-paralleling agreement applied equally to the north and south as to the east and west, if anything more so because Panagra was established to be a connecting and complimentary carrier with Pan American.</text>

            <text syncTime="6609.299" offset="26540596">I want to say two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="6612.021" offset="26551463">If the Court assumes, contrary to all that I've argued up to now, that there was exclusion of Panagra here, that the exclusion was not justified, this case founders fatally upon the key-finding that I read to you from the Government's brief that the exclusion gave Pan American a monopoly on this segment in which it was dominant.</text>
            <text syncTime="6643.492" offset="26677373">There is no evidence whatever, I repeat it, there is no evidence whatever of this suggestion of dominance of Pan American upon this route.</text>
            <text syncTime="6656.768" offset="26730454">The only evidence, the totality of evidence on this subject is that there are eight airlines that compete for this traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="6666.250" offset="26768384">There is nothing in the record as to the division of the traffic between them as to the share of the traffic, this record is bare as to anything about competitive conditions on this segment except the single significant fact that eight airlines compete for the traffic which navigates in itself this suggestion of dominance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6687.755" offset="26854379">Now, the reason that the evidence isn't here is just the significance of the fact that it isn't here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6693.859" offset="26878830">And that is the Government never suggested, never thought, never advanced the idea that Pan American was dominant on this segment and that its exclusion of Panagra gave it to monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="6707.538" offset="26933478">And furthermore, equally significant, is the reason or the way in which the District Court came to its conclusion of dominance, it was a mistake of law, pure and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="6721.184" offset="26988126">As stated by the District Court, the District Court was under the impression that this traffic between these two points was overseas traffic instead of foreign traffic and hence that the only ones who could compete for it were American airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="6737.529" offset="27053537">What he didn't realize, no such issue was presented or would have been clarified that ever since 1949, when since the Panama -- since the airbase -- airfield for the Canal Zone has been in Panama, it has been foreign traffic not overseas traffic, and there are eight lines competing from it, so the whole finding of the District on this subject has no support in fact and is based entirely of Panama's state of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="6766.608" offset="27169834">Now finally in a gallop, may it please the Court, I want to say a word about divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="6773.570" offset="27197628">If one were to assume that I have been wrong about everything that I've stated to the Court so far, I would still say that this remedy of divestiture is inadmissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="6784.235" offset="27240364">It's unnecessary, it's unwarranted and it's unjustified.</text>
            <text syncTime="6789.017" offset="27259486">In -- it's only suggestion of sustaining it, the District Court cites the -- Solicitor General cites one case, the DuPont case, which holds a divestiture as a proper remedy where the heart of the illegality is in the intercorporate combination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6809.160" offset="27340048">Now, that is exactly what this case isn't upon the decision of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6815.350" offset="27364812">There is no illegality in the intercorporate combination and therefore, divestiture cannot be rested upon that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="6824.217" offset="27400234">Obviously, we submit, the legal remedy of injunctions such as incorporated in this decree would be sufficient, which is that Pan American should do what the District Court said it should have done in the first place and all that the District Court said that it should have done, is to permit an application to be made to the CAB and then go and argue it out before the CAB as the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said it was proper as to whether it should be granted or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6853.752" offset="27518412">So a simple remedy of injunction would be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="6860.876" offset="27546833">The other tragedy of divestiture as far as Pan American is concerned, would be that it couldn't possibly realize for the stock, anything that it ought to realize for something that it created and build up from nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6879.214" offset="27620185">I can leave it to the Court for judicial notice that no one is going to buy into this airline 50% of the stock and become a partner with Grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="6889.682" offset="27662085">And finally, as I pointed out in the beginning, this decree of divestiture flies fairly in the face of what the CAB has said should happen here, it would result in projecting Panagra as a third airline into an area where the CAB says there must only be two because to have more than two would be either a waste of public funds or private investment.</text>

            <text syncTime="7136.724" offset="28650245">I would at the very outset, like to make crystal clear what the Government's objective has been and is against my client W.R. Grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="7150.679" offset="28706043">It is as the court below observed, an effort by the Civil Aeronautics Board and by the Department of Justice to compel a merger of two American competing airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="7163.237" offset="28756302">Indeed, the only two American lines competing on this route.</text>
            <text syncTime="7169.353" offset="28780753">This is, as I submit, diametrically opposed to the customary efforts of the Department of Justice which is to prevent horizontal mergers, not to coerce them.</text>
            <text syncTime="7183.051" offset="28835610">The Government has plainly stated that it brought this suit at the behest of the Civil Aeronautics Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="7187.524" offset="28853478">Now, the Board had two reasons for urging the Department of Justice to bring this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="7195.228" offset="28884302">First, the Board as had Grace and claimed for 20 years by Pan American's continued refusal to permit Panagra to even apply to the Civil Aeronautics Board for the right to come through to the United States in competition with Pan American.</text>

            <text syncTime="7248.131" offset="29095894">At the same time, the Civil Aeronautics Board put Braniff in as our competitor with access to the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="7274.451" offset="29201220">The second reason that the Board had for urging the Department of Justice to institute this suit, was that it recognized that it was an error in 1946, when it certificated Braniff on the expectation that there would be sufficient traffic to support two carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="7293.427" offset="29277080">This turned out not to be the fact and the Civil Aeronautics Board was desirous of alleviating the burden of subsidizing the loss of two carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="7303.208" offset="29316159">So they decided that these two carriers should merge.</text>
            <text syncTime="7307.269" offset="29332459">And the suggestion has been made repeatedly by the Civil Aeronautics Board that Braniff, the joining company lately should not merge into Panagra but Panagra should merge into Braniff and permit Braniff to be this surviving carrier solely because it wanted to get rid of this bitter impasse that had resulted from Pan American's continued rejection of Grace's attempts to extend Panagra into the United States which the Board itself had repeatedly and urgently solicited the partners to cooperate in so doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7340.162" offset="29464012">I submit that insofar as this case is based upon the desire of the Civil Aeronautics Board and the Department of Justice, to compel Grace to divest itself, it is improperly found.</text>
            <text syncTime="7351.959" offset="29511241">The Government, may it please the Court, on the eve of trial in 1959, entered into a consent decree with Pan American and submitted the same to the Court for its approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="7363.144" offset="29555963">Under this decree, Pan American agreed to divest itself of its entire interest in Braniff -- in Panagra in favor of Braniff, provided for reasons best known to itself that Grace could be persuaded or compelled to divest itself of its interest in Panagra.</text>
            <text syncTime="7382.526" offset="29633494">Grace objected that District Court disapproved -- refused to approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="7388.472" offset="29657213">Among the reasons that Grace objected to the approval of the decree was number one, it felt in its opinion that it would not give immediate and effective relief to Panagra, to Grace and to the traveling public.</text>
            <text syncTime="7402.543" offset="29713533">Further, Grace felt that as a pioneer here, that is one of the people who have fought vigorously for the rights of Panagra, it should not be requested, directed or ruined to give up its interest in the facility that it had created along with Pan American but the only one of the two partners who had fought for its rights continuously since its organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="7428.144" offset="29815933">I submit that the grandfather provisions of the Civil Aeronautics Act, now the Federal Aviation Act, which confirms two pioneer carriers that were operating at the time of the passage of the Act that they shall have the right to continue to operate under the certificate from the Board prevents, precludes any such attempted compulsion of a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="7454.931" offset="29923140">The air transport -- the air transportation policy of the United States might or might not be served by such a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="7462.750" offset="29954382">What I submit is surely clear is that there is nothing in the antitrust laws upon which this case is necessarily based which can order Grace to divest itself in favor of a particular person, Braniff or anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="7486.602" offset="30049782">I submit further the -- may it please the Court, that insofar as this case is based upon Pan American's continued refusal to permit Panagra to come through to the United States that it has properly founded and ought to prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="7503.000" offset="30115401">This refusal hasn't been impeded competition, this restraint was found by the Court as an attempt by Pan American to monopolize the segment of the transportation field and it does warrant an antitrust remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="7518.865" offset="30178826">The question is, what should the remedy be and against whom should it be granted, I submit that the District Court properly found that it should be Pan American that should be divested or the case should be dismissed as to Grace.</text>
            <text syncTime="7538.267" offset="30256462">The District Court in so finding and directing Pan American's dive -- divestiture, clearly found that there was never any agreement between any of the parties or among any of the parties that prevented Panagra from applying coming to the United States and restricting it to routes south of the Canal Zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="7559.123" offset="30339845">Rather the District Court found that Pan American unilaterally imposed these unlawful restraints upon Panagra in its attempt to maintain enacting or obtain a monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="7573.616" offset="30397837">Pan American itself has admitted this when Grace for the first time in 1938 proposed to Pan American that Panagra apply to the Civil Aeronautics Board, the matter was discussed at a Pan American Board meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="7589.255" offset="30460426">And it's in the record and the minutes clearly show that Pan American there determined that such an expansion would not be in the interest of our stockholders, namely the stockholders of Pan American, not of Panagra, to have Panagra come north in competition, in further competition with Pan American and they have consistently maintained that position until today.</text>

            <text syncTime="7644.079" offset="30679646">It comes with the Canal Zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="7645.572" offset="30685706">It is dependent on Pan American, through flight going out with Pan American's route into Miami and to Miami to New York on an interchange where its pilots and its crew were taken off into New York on the national airline.</text>

            <text syncTime="7781.926" offset="31231039">They argue on the one hand that Grace agreed with Pan American that Panagra should not compete with Pan American and that Pan American shouldn't compete with Panagra.</text>
            <text syncTime="7794.276" offset="31280462">If the District Court found the Government does not deny and in fact admits, that Grace was the only one of the two partners that fought and fought vigorously for Panagra's extension in competition with Pan American.</text>
            <text syncTime="7809.530" offset="31341484">Another contradiction that the Government finds itself in is that they say that the affiliation of Grace -- Grace Line with Panagra, restrained the development of Panagra.</text>
            <text syncTime="7822.870" offset="31394879">Yet on the other hand, they attest to the fact that Panagra is one of the leading airlines on the west coast of South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="7831.091" offset="31427688">They say that its air cargo had been vigorously developed within the past years.</text>
            <text syncTime="7838.093" offset="31455796">Who did that?</text>
            <text syncTime="7839.295" offset="31460603">Only Grace is operating Panagra under the management of agreement they entered into, certainly Pan American is not interested in developing Panagra, they have done everything to restrain it as the record clearly shows and as the Court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="7856.869" offset="31530820">It is difficult for me to see how the Government can continue to argue this case and support both theories, Grace restrained Panagra in favor of the Grace line, yet Grace vigorously fought for Panagra.</text>
            <text syncTime="7870.777" offset="31586513">And Panagra had as the Government claims maintain and ascertain a dominant position.</text>
            <text syncTime="7877.923" offset="31615039">Turning now to the first argument that the Government advances in this understanding of agreement between Grace and Pan American, which they referred to as this division of territories in the east-west, the Government complains that Grace and Pan American agreed to limit this fear of Pan American and Panagra.</text>
            <text syncTime="7900.966" offset="31707199">Now, I state that this argument found is on two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="7904.952" offset="31723186">First, that it's clear from the record and I say that the Court so found that this agreement terminated over a quarter of a century ago and that since that time, Grace has neither attempted to enforce it or indeed has even recognize it as an existing agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="7925.132" offset="31803852">Now, this I say is evident from Grace's consistent course of action for the past 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="7933.030" offset="31835512">In answer, I believe to Mr. Justice White's question, the Solicitor General said that the actions of the parties then were the same as they are now in connection with why was he attacking the combination at its creation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7947.058" offset="31891623">And he pointed and referred to the fact, Pan American was still continuing to restrain.</text>
            <text syncTime="7952.744" offset="31914297">I think it's interesting to note that he had no point mentioned anything that Grace was doing since 1938 and even prior to 1938, this agreement ,I submit, was perfectly valid as the District Court found.</text>
            <text syncTime="7968.828" offset="31978663">Prior to the enactment of the Civil Aeronautics Act in 1938, as I believe it has been pointed out, these independent airlines depended on air mail contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="7979.483" offset="32021295">Without them, you could not operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="7982.047" offset="32031535">People tried it and they were losing at the rate of $40,000 a month, which even those days, was a lot of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="7988.542" offset="32057553">These contracts were at the periods of 10 year.</text>
            <text syncTime="7991.781" offset="32070510">The Post Office Department and the State Department clearly defined, lays down as the Government admits, enforced the policy of a no parallel operating carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="8003.672" offset="32118053">In other words, the Post Office Department would not support and the State Department would not assist two carriers for the same route.</text>
            <text syncTime="8011.944" offset="32151176">And this continued up until 1938, it was during this period that Pan American and Grace recognizing the economic impossibility of competition as the District Court found that they did not move into the other territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="8029.731" offset="32222333">Number one, they couldn't because there would be no air mail contract for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="8034.456" offset="32241246">Two, they would not have the assistance of the State Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="8039.841" offset="32262771">And it is this agreement upon which the Government is resting its case and saying that it continued as far as Grace is concerned, it never continued.</text>
            <text syncTime="8049.556" offset="32301641">Immediately in 1938, with the passage of the Civil Aeronautics Act, Grace pressed for an expansion of Panagra.</text>
            <text syncTime="8058.310" offset="32336645">We not only pressed that its route be extended coming north.</text>
            <text syncTime="8062.311" offset="32352632">We pressed that they'd be extended going east.</text>
            <text syncTime="8065.075" offset="32363708">We asked Pan American to agree to permit Panagra to go into Rio and Sao Polo, they refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="8071.247" offset="32388368">They have recognized this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="8073.049" offset="32395577">They have maintained that it continues to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="8076.407" offset="32408952">And we state, it terminated in 1938 when its validity terminated as the Government itself said in a jurisdictional statement filed in this Court, the agreement ceased to be valid no later than 1938.</text>

            <text syncTime="8413.847" offset="33758751">Now, I respectfully submit that the District Court was absolutely correct when it found that in this particular case, Panagra and the Grace line did not comprise part of the same market.</text>
            <text syncTime="8426.762" offset="33810369">This is -- I think it's obvious from a mere appreciation of what is Panagra and what is Grace Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="8434.979" offset="33843284">Pangara is essentially a carrier of passengers, whereas this is the most insignificant part of Grace Line's business.</text>
            <text syncTime="8444.204" offset="33880168">Even more important, is that the few passengers that Grace Line carries are not prospective customers of Panagra.</text>
            <text syncTime="8454.464" offset="33921233">And I think this is evident from these two pieces of thought which we find in the record and they relate to the time consumed and the cost of the travel.</text>
            <text syncTime="8463.614" offset="33957804">Prior to the institution of getting the service, it took a passenger on Panagra from New York to Santiago 21 hours, on the Grace Line, 21 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="8475.006" offset="34003362">Taking another point, New York to Panama, it took 10 hours by Panagra, six to seven days on the Grace line.</text>
            <text syncTime="8484.014" offset="34039411">Now, the record shows that there're equally rate differences in the course.</text>
            <text syncTime="8489.080" offset="34059682">On Panagra, the tourist fare from New York to Santiago was $414.</text>
            <text syncTime="8494.548" offset="34081520">On Grace Line, the minimum fare during the winter season is $645, on the off season, $595 and down to $545.</text>
            <text syncTime="8507.314" offset="34132616">So you have these differences of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="8509.510" offset="34141393">You have 21 hours as the record shows against 21 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="8514.427" offset="34161037">Now, if one is much quicker and cheaper than the other mean, why is it that anyone goes on the Grace Line?</text>
            <text syncTime="8521.973" offset="34191235">I submit that the only answer is that they want the experience and perhaps the relaxation of a notion voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="8528.249" offset="34216417">That is something that Panagra does not and cannot offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="8532.377" offset="34232926">The Government takes the position that well, vacation may be torn between flying down to the Argentina and spending six weeks there as against taking six weeks sea voyage.</text>
            <text syncTime="8544.952" offset="34283186">But I submit if that is what to -- we are to regard as compromising the same market, you have to put in this very market, hotels in the Caribbean, lodges up in and out because the vacation -- he's looking at that, he's looking at everything in his vacation folder.</text>
            <text syncTime="8560.981" offset="34347342">Turning quickly Your Honor to the manner of the freight that the Solicitor General argued at such great length, again, it's important I think to consider how much does Grace Line carry as against Panagra.</text>
            <text syncTime="8577.646" offset="34414007">In 1958, Grace Line carried almost 1 million tons, Panagra, 3000 tons.</text>
            <text syncTime="8585.338" offset="34444727">The fact that Panagra's service needs that the steamship company cannot meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="8590.982" offset="34467297">I think there's evidence from the comparison of the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="8594.279" offset="34480462">The general commodity rate on Panagra for 2000 pounds moving from New York to Santiago is $1660; on the Grace Line, $90.</text>
            <text syncTime="8607.559" offset="34533648">Now, it's obvious that even if there were some fluctuation in the prices here, they could not by any means get close enough together whether it'd be a matter of difference to a shipper as to whether head ship on the Grace line or on Panagra.</text>
            <text syncTime="8621.317" offset="34588609">And I submit that it's unlikely that these rates will change to any large degree because the rates are based largely on the cost involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="8631.509" offset="34629360">And the record will show that the cost of carrying freight on Panagra or cargo service, from July 1957 to January 1959 was $35.06 per ton mile, while in the 1958, on the Grace line, it was only 6 tenths to 7 tenths of 1 cent per ton mile.</text>
            <text syncTime="8652.025" offset="34711489">Now, with that great difference in cost, one cannot expect that there's going to be any change in rate, at least any significant change to make the $1660 charge somewhat compatible with a $90 charge on the Grace Line.</text>
            <text syncTime="8671.734" offset="34790275">The Solicitor General during the course of his argument relied upon the testimony of a few witnesses presented by Pan American as to whether they compete with steamship companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="8684.284" offset="34840534">I could have told Your Honors what the testimony would have been before the gentleman talked.</text>
            <text syncTime="8689.612" offset="34861850">Because Pan American has usually referred to the Grace people as they both have.</text>
            <text syncTime="8693.891" offset="34878986">They have no love for their partner who had put them in this difficult situation by asking that Panagra be extended in competition with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="8702.182" offset="34912110">But I think perhaps the best witness to rely upon, is the Government's own witness which the Solicitor General did not quote, and he testified as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="8717.567" offset="34973654">Bear with me just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="8719.703" offset="34982222">The vast majority of export freight, tons in ton miles would have commodities that could not possibly have been carried by airplane.</text>
            <text syncTime="8729.141" offset="35019943">And he further testified, steamship rates on quantity movement are far below attainable cost for moving freight by air in the foreseeable future.</text>
            <text syncTime="8739.126" offset="35059858">Your Honor, I see that my time is running out but I do want to refer to the Solicitor General reading from various isolated documents in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="8750.557" offset="35105625">Wholly with age back in the early 1930s, these believe me were selected documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="8755.678" offset="35126105">We have filed a reply and you will find that document from Grace officials attesting to the fact, instructing the employees down the line that they are to be completely impartial.</text>
            <text syncTime="8767.062" offset="35171662">In fact, there was one letter cited by the Government which was answered and contradicted that that was not in their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="8773.608" offset="35197785">We have pointed it out in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="8776.799" offset="35210533">In conclusion, Your Honors, I would like to say that here, we have a clear picture of W.R. Grace who has attempted to promote and in fact has promoted the interest of Panagra.</text>
            <text syncTime="8794.769" offset="35282422">It has met with the opposition of Pan American.</text>
            <text syncTime="8797.829" offset="35294647">The District Court has ordered the divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="8800.587" offset="35305723">In fact, the District Court has permitted Grace to file an additional application on its own that we are in the burden that if Pan American is not divested that is reversed, that application must be withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="8815.588" offset="35365700">We do have our other applications pending as I mentioned to Mr. Justice Goldberg (Voice Overlap) on the fraud and illegality point.</text>
