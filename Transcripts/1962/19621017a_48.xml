        <title>Federal Power Commission v. Tennessee Gas Transmission Company</title>
        <section startTime="0" stopTime="3158.828">
          <heading>Argument of Ralph S. Spritzer</heading>
          <turn speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="0.000" stopTime="216.284">
            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">This case is here on certiorari to the Fifth Circuit involves an order of the Federal Power Commission entered in a Section 4 rate proceeding under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.479" offset="181269">It raises the question and I shall state it very broadly at the outset in seek to refine it later, whether the Commission is authorized to dispose of a portion of a rate case in order to relieve consumers immediately of some of the burdens of excessive charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.643" offset="285968">In advance of its disposition of the entire proceeding, the rate proponent here, the respondent, Tennessee Gas Transmission Company, is an interstate pipeline extending from Texas and Louisiana, its southern extremities to the New England states at the northern, doing business in some 16 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.192" offset="408116">As an interstate company, as Your Honors know, it is obligated to file its tariffs with the Federal Power Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.793" offset="450539">Commission regulations further require that any filing for increased rates and this is an increase rate proceeding shall be accompanied by a full supporting statement as to the costs of service which are relied upon as justification for the company's proposed rates or charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.040" offset="567568">It's to set forth for example the cost of its purchase to gas, the cost of labor, supplies, its estimate as to the taxes it will pay, estimated depreciation allowance and its claim for fair return on its net invested capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.171" offset="656071">Now, upon the filing of the tariffs then the supporting statements, the Commission is empowered in its discretion to suspend the rates and to enter upon a hearing as to their lawfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.369" offset="724825">This suspension is limited to five months duration.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.499" offset="749380">Thereafter, the company may make the increases effective even though the hearing has not yet been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.487" offset="785324">In that event, however, the company has an obligation under the statute to refund any portion of the increase ultimately found not justified, as well as to adjust its rates prospectively to whatever level may be prescribe by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.874" offset="882918">One further aspect of this statutory scheme, there is emphasis in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.603" offset="925759">If I may refer the Court to pages 48 and 49 of our brief where Section 4 (e) is set forth.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="216.284" offset="968495">What page is that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="217.736" stopTime="394.921">
            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="217.736" offset="974346">I'm looking now at the middle of page 49, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.521" offset="993468">The last four or five lines of the section provides at any hearing involving a rate or charge sought to be increased.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.487" offset="1045295">The burden of proof to show that the increased rate or charge is just unreasonable shall be upon the natural gas company and the Commission shall give to the hearing and decision of such questions preference over other questions pending before it and decide the same as steadily as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.231" offset="1136306">Now, this last as not always so easily accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.035" offset="1159502">Tennessee actually filed the increases, which are involved in this proceeding in October of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.014" offset="1207463">When those increased rates were filed, they were already pending before the Commission two prior sets of increases; one, which had been filed the earlier in 1959, the other filed back in 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.898" offset="1290951">Both of which were themselves that that stage in the toils of the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.026" offset="1323447">I suppose you might visualize the situation in terms of a stairway consisting of three steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.274" offset="1360436">The floor from which these steps ascend might be said to represent the rates as they existed in 1957 when the Commission had last approved a set of Tennessee rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.499" offset="1429400">The first step upward represents the increases for which the company filed in 1957 that same year.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.299" offset="1468583">The second step, the increases for which the company filed in May of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.615" offset="1497840">The third step, and that refer -- and that's the proceeding that is before the Court immediately at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.455" offset="1529187">The increases which is I indicated earlier were filed in October of 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.349" offset="1564818">The difference incidentally in the yield produced by the rates at the floor level and the yield which will be produced at the level of step 3, computed in terms of relatively current gas sales amounts to that $75 million a year.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Earl Warren</label>
            <text syncTime="394.921" offset="1683101">Mr. Spritzer, may I ask what happened to those first two steps?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ralph_s_spritzer" startTime="400.532" stopTime="914.949">
            <label>Mr. Ralph S. Spritzer</label>
            <text syncTime="400.532" offset="1705462">They are still in administrative proceedings, Your Honor, and I'm going to refer during the argument to the chronology of these various cases because they do bear some relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.245" offset="1764394">We have asked that -- that they'll be distributed to the Court a chronology sheet which I think may make that easier to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.101" offset="1807757">As this thumbnail sketch of the three pending rate dockets does suggest, one of the facts of life with which the regulatory commission has had to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.452" offset="1873168">And I think in recent days, they're making various strenuous efforts to find ways and means to deal with it, is that the capacity of the natural gas company to file new sets of rates may tend to outstrip the capacity of the agency to dispose of these large and complex cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.017" offset="1991450">And I think that brings us closer to the core of this case for the procedural device which the Commission has employed here is one which it is utilizing in this and in other pipeline rate cases in an effort to provide more promptly to consumers a measure of relief from the burdens of rates which are found to be excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.916" offset="2110986">Now, the rates of the pipeline company are aggregates.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.562" offset="2133661">By that, I mean, that numerous elements enter into the cost of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.931" offset="2155081">As I mentioned a little earlier in speaking of the supporting statements, which a pipeline is required to submit with its filing, there are various components, how much is the pipeline paying the producer for the gas, which it purchases and it sends on the customer companies?</text>
            <text syncTime="534.962" offset="2243271">What is the estimate of its annual payroll?</text>
            <text syncTime="539.282" offset="2260511">What will it need for taxes and depreciation and for fair return on investment?</text>
            <text syncTime="545.600" offset="2285798">Now, some of these items may well be uncontroverted in a particular case, others will be challenged by various parties to the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.753" offset="2334386">Characteristically, some of these issues are great complexity and require many weeks or even months of testimony, a protracted battle of the utility experts.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.167" offset="2387989">Others will admit of more expeditious treatment.Suppose that the Commission concludes in a particular case that it may take two or more years to dispose of one these large rate cases in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.524" offset="2457475">But that one or two controverted issues, issues, which perhaps involved a substantial portion of the cost which are seriously disputed are susceptible of separate and much earlier disposition, can the Commission decide the one or two issues accepting for purposes of its interim decision, the remaining claims of the company assuming their correctness for the time being.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.190" offset="2604178">In other words, if it finds that the certain elements which it have examined, certain elements of the company's claim have been overstated, can it, to that extent order refunds for the past and more important late reductions for the future?</text>
            <text syncTime="646.786" offset="2690487">Now, as I understand our opponent's brief here, Tennessee is not urging a categorical no to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.869" offset="2734895">Rather, it seems to say that perhaps sometimes the Commission might do this but not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.374" offset="2776900">Well, what precisely did the Commission do in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="674.506" offset="2801351">The increases which Tennessee proposed in October 1959, were predicated in large part upon a claim that it was entitled to a 7% overall rate of return on its net invested capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.089" offset="2871777">This was in contrast to the 6% rate which the Commission had allowed Tennessee in its last completed rate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.690" offset="2922141">Now, the hearings in this case began in February of 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.156" offset="2955995">The course so that it shown by this chronology sheet in the right-hand column.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.224" offset="2992253">Tennessee at that hearing presented its direct evidence, its witnesses within cross-examined exclusively on the issue of rate of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.473" offset="3045230">Thereafter, the Federal Power Commission staff and those of the interveners who wished to do so, presented their testimony on that same issue of rate of return and their experts were cross-examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.636" offset="3105938">Finally, Tennessee presented its rebuttal on rate of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.902" offset="3126941">When all of the evidence tendered on this issue was in the record, staff -- Commission staff counsel moved, this was in May of 1960, that the proceedings be divided into two faces.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.133" offset="3199875">One, determination of a proper rate of return for this company, two, determination of the remaining cost of service issues in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.434" offset="3245119">He further proposed that the examiner's decision be omitted and that the Commission proceed to decide this issue directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.079" offset="3287646">The Commission adopted this procedure over Tennessee's objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.056" offset="3307604">And after hearing oral argument on the issue of rate of return, wrote an opinion in August of 1960 in which it found that 6 1/8% would be a just and reasonable return for the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.329" offset="3380642">By its order, which is the order here under review, the Commission did three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.018" offset="3415437">One, it disallowed the rates computed by Tennessee on the basis of the excessive 7% rate of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.218" offset="3472280">Two, it directed Tennessee to file substitute rates, such rates to be effective as of the time the disallowed rates had originally gone into effect which would yield 6 1/8%.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.504" offset="3549393">Three, it ordered Tennessee to refund to its customers the amounts which had already been collected in excess of the prescribed interim rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.302" offset="3612609">In its opinion, the Commission pointed out that by permitting Tennessee to file substitute rates based on a proper rate of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.161" offset="3660048">But otherwise, based in every particular on the company's own claims as to what it was entitled to, Tennessee would be placed in exactly the same position that it would've been in if it had originally filed increased rates predicated upon a proper allowance for this rate of return factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="975.290" offset="4004551">Actually, the allocation I would say Your Honor, is an element which enters in to the rate when the company files it.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.273" offset="4032449">It must consider the situation of all of the customers who were being served.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.988" offset="4059303">Now, before the Fifth Circuit, Tennessee challenged both the Commission's determination that the 6 1/8% was a proper rate of return and the Commission's authority to give immediate effect to that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.053" offset="4123564">On the first question, the Court of Appeals unanimously sustained the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.170" offset="4148015">Tennessee did not petition from that determination and that issue is not before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.181" offset="4172048">It is now being definitively determined that 6 1/8% is the just and reasonable rate of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.578" offset="4205693">On the second issue, namely whether the Commission could require an immediate reduction by virtue of its determination of this portion of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.080" offset="4255640">The Court ruled against the Government with Chief Judge Tatel dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.949" offset="4283120">In connection with the Court of Appeals' ruling, perhaps I should also note that Tennessee sought a stay before the case was heard in that court and that stay was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.794" offset="4346546">Moreover, after the case was decided, the Court of Appeals stayed its mandate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.195" offset="4388133">The consequence is that the Commission's order has been continuously in effect and is now in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.678" offset="6898082">Actually, the review that has been sought there by one of the customer companies rather than by Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.071" offset="6931623">Now, as to the power of the Commission to use this method, our basic position is that Tennessee has the burden of justifying each of the component claims which makes up the total that it seeks to refute by its rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.266" offset="7008423">As to the claim that it's entitled to a 7% rate of return, it failed to do so after it had a full hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.812" offset="7038621">And we say, having had its hearing on that issue, there is no reason why it should continue to collect any more than it would've collected, had it file its rates on the basis of a proper rate of return factor in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.222" offset="7100270">We believe that the Commission under Sections 4 and 5 of its Act has plenary rate powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.242" offset="7128377">And if for purposes of proscribing rates, the Commission can therefore assume arguendo the correctness of the other claims which are made by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.168" offset="7184071">We also point out that Section 16 of the Act, which is the necessary and proper article of this statute, authorizes the entry of any order necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.594" offset="7253765">This Court has often said that a fundamental purpose of the effect is to afford prompt protection to consumers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1811.207" offset="7348224">We think the Commission was well within its authority in terminating Tennessee's effort to continue collections on the basis of a claim which had already been found unjustified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.797" offset="7398588">We find support in a number of cases for the use of this interim order type procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.323" offset="7432652">One case in this Court, the Natural Gas Pipeline Company case, in the 315 U.S., held that a company which had predicated its entire direct -- which had presented excuse me, its entire direct testimony in support of its rates, could not complain that it had not yet been able to cross examine Commission witnesses on aspects of the case, which for purposes of the interim order, the Commission had decided on the basis of the company's presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.444" offset="7573191">Several other Courts of Appeals have similarly allowed use of an interim order procedure to decide a portion of a rate case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.165" offset="7612061">The Third Circuit's Panhandle decision is close to this one and that it also involve rates predicated upon a claim to an increase rate of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.925" offset="7675068">In that case, Judge Hastie spoke for the Third Circuit and I'd like to refer for a moment to one or two sentences of his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.781" offset="7734523">True, he said in recognition of the time involved in these often long drawn out rate proceedings, the Commission quite properly permits the basic showing of the justification, which existed at the time of filing to be supplemented by evidence of occurrences since filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.966" offset="7823235">But this is far from saying that a party who tries and fails to make a prima facie showing to support severable elements of his claim is entitled to a postponement of adjudication thereon in anticipation of possible new justification which some future event may supply before the overall case can be completed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2109.085" offset="8539721">Now, perhaps I should turn without further delay to Tennessee's contention that the availability of the interim order procedure that it is not available in cases where there is an allocation issue remaining to be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.842" offset="8654764">Now, essentially what Tennessee is saying, is that the Commission's determination that Tennessee's cost of service is less than Tennessee estimated it to be, will only lead to proportional reductions to all customers of Tennessee, will only lead to that if one assumes that the rate relationships, the rates in various zones are going to remain intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.669" offset="8862072">Tennessee says further, that if it should turn out that the rate structure was all wrong in the Commission's view, that the rate structure was invalid or discriminatory, then it might be, it might be that though Tennessee in all was entitled to collect only something less than what it sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.690" offset="8978160">That nonetheless, its rates to particular customers might not be too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.796" offset="9010552">Perhaps I can make this clearer by attempting an illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.731" offset="9042317">Let's suppose that the Tennessee has three zones rather than six for simplicity's sake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.831" offset="9070738">And that the basic rate was 60 cents in MCF in Zone 1, 80 cents in Zone 2 and a dollar in Zone 3, that these are the rates for which Tennessee filed in order to produce let us a hundred million dollar of gross revenues a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.084" offset="9163734">Let's suppose further that as in this case, the Commission examined one element of the cost of service in advance of the others and said, you're wrong, you're not entitled to a $100 million a year, you're seeking that on a basis of an inflated claim as to what rate of return your stockholder should have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.099" offset="9251819">We find that you're only entitled to $90 million a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.118" offset="9271881">Let us suppose further that at that point, the Commission said, since your total cost of service we found was exaggerated by 10%, we will order a 10% reduction across the board from 60, 80 and a dollar to 54, 72 and 90 cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.330" offset="9368743">I'm also assuming in this illustration for the sake of simplicity that they're selling equal volumes in each zones, so you effectuate the reduction by a flat across the board cut in the rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.305" offset="9424541">Now, says Tennessee if there's an allocation issue in the case, it might turn out that some of the premises upon which we fixed rates, 60, 80 and a dollar were all wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.949" offset="9479189">It might turn out though we're entitled only to $90 million overall that instead of cutting the rates equally 10% in each zone, the Commission will ultimately say that they ought to be cut 15% in Zones 2 and 3 but they should've remain the same on Zone 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.690" offset="9554108">In other words, it should've remained at 60 cents in Zone 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.021" offset="9571453">Now says, Tennessee further, if the consequence of the Commission's order in its impact on Zone 1 is to reduce the rates for that interim period from 60 cents to 54 cents and it should ultimately be determined that the final stage of the proceeding that we're entitled to 60 cents in that zone, we will have no way of going back in collecting that 6 cents difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.111" offset="9683780">Our answer to that is that it is the burden of the company which proposes all of the rates, the rates in each zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.276" offset="9732472">It's the burden of the company to have a nondiscriminatory rate structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.762" offset="9758386">And if that risk cannot be shifted to the consumer, the company is chargeable and the words of Section 4 (b) of the statute, if it grants any undue preference to any person or maintains any unreasonable difference as between localities or as between classes of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.360" offset="9852844">We point out further that the risk of which Tennessee complains is precisely the same risk as it would've had if it had filed on the basis of a proper rate of return, 6 1/8% in the first instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3250.316" offset="13104671">And on -- this is on page 19 of the petition for writ of certiorari and right there, they referred to what happened in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.586" offset="13133720">They pointed out that they settled 31 and I used the word “decided” or settled, or concluded 31 pipeline cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.943" offset="13171127">And that in doing so, they reduced the amount requested by 37% and that in reducing it back 37%, 56% of this amount of reduction was in the rate of return, the very thing that it is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.739" offset="13234343">Now, I would call the Court's attention to the fact that according to the Commission's 1961 Report, 30 and I emphasize, 30 of these 31 were settled only one was actually decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.261" offset="13308426">Now, why is that in Court in here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.897" offset="13318980">Because under the -- in the context of this case, Tennessee asked for $75 million, $11 million was disallowed in the rate of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.952" offset="13351163">The examiner has allowed an additional -- or disallowed an additional $26 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.892" offset="13370911">$37 million or 50% has been disallowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.489" offset="13385331">So, the situation that exist down at the Federal Power Commission, the reason why the Commission has moved into use this interim power at long last is, this is a rather shocking way to evade rate regulation under the Natural Gas Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.423" offset="13457115">These pipeline companies filed one rate increase -- this is Tennessee did here, one on -- right on top of another and so this backlog, this regulatory log grows larger and larger and there's tremendous pressure to settle -- to settle and when you settle, it's the consumer that loses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.538" offset="13533497">These pipeline companies are very glad to come in and say, well, we'll take 10% or 25% off and of course that always means millions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.305" offset="13572577">And so then they push those of us who represent consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.875" offset="13582921">Well, let's settle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.421" offset="13585011">Let's settle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.822" offset="13586683">There's tremendous pressure on the Commission staff to settle and they always get more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.474" offset="13609253">So this allowance of 37% in 1961 is a great boom for the pipeline companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.762" offset="13642376">This business is conference procedure, the settlement procedure I know that the Commission is doing a terrific job.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.979" offset="13663274">I'm not criticizing at all but I am saying that right here the Commission has put its finger on one of the greatest escape route and that you have no effective regulation of natural gas company today under the Natural Gas Act because of this very thing, this pyramiding of one rate increase right on top of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.859" offset="13726804">And I think that the Court should take all of those facts into consideration in deciding this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.080" offset="13747702">Not only do I agree with what Mr. Spritzer had said but I think that this pressurized settlement of cases before the Federal Power Commission is one of the most vital things that this Court must consider in facing up to what the Commission is trying to do about this pated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.140" offset="13827950">And I say, it's closer to 50% than 37% rate increase.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.272" offset="13844459">Then the Commission can't stop these pipelines from doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.971" offset="13855222">They have an absolute power to file one year after year almost day after day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.174" offset="13876120">So, we urge that this interim power which the Commission has at long last started to use is absolutely vital to prevent the frustration or the major purpose of the Natural Gas Act and to stop this greedy train escape route, this windfall to the pipeline companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.063" offset="13955636">Now, I was to discuss whether refunds were an adequate remedy for consumers and we say they're not for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.293" offset="14008508">Number one, under today's mobile society, people move around all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.475" offset="14029302">And when one of these rate cases has completed four or five, six, seven years after it started, you'd have a hard time finding the ultimate consumer who paid the illegal rates and get the money back in his pocket because it comes out of the ultimate consumer's pocket not out of the pipeline or other distribution company's pocket.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.335" offset="14100668">Secondly, in connection with the rate increase and this is particularly important for small business, as well as large business, when a rate increase goes into effect, they must increase the price of their product immediately in order to recover what they paid out of their pocket right then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.423" offset="14165034">And that puts him in a terrible competitive position with respect to those who use other kinds of fuel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.268" offset="14188440">Now, they can't change over to some other kind of view because the cost of putting in new burning equipment is too great.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.054" offset="14215607">So, when they come along to the end of this thing five, six, seven, eight years afterwards and there's a refund, it doesn't pay him for these business losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.097" offset="14255731">There is an immediate effect on the consumer and they get back the rate increase is plus 7% interest after deduction of a lot of expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.851" offset="14298781">So they never get all of their money back.</text>

            <text syncTime="3685.170" offset="14844008">And I don't know whether they thought that the Commission could decide this case within five months but if they had thought that refunds were adequate, they wouldn't provide a suspension.</text>

            <text syncTime="3768.906" offset="15179003">They seem to be trying to say that somebody up in Boston out to pay this illegal 7% rate so that they can get their hands on it on a refund.</text>

            <text syncTime="3782.922" offset="15235009">And in the second place, Tennessee has entered into an obligation, it's on page 508 of the record, to pay ack all of these illegal amounts and Tennessee is a giant too, they have billion and a half dollar corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.699" offset="15286209">They are present in this record over on pages 419 and the following talks about how rich and prosperous they are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3801.345" offset="15308779">They have plenty of money to pay it back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.861" offset="15314840">So, Columbia can't possibly be hurt anyway that you approach this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.823" offset="15334693">Now, they say maybe this, maybe this, maybe Columbia will have some money coming back, maybe Tennessee will have some money coming back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.815" offset="15362591">But with this $26 billion bulge or padding or pad, as Chief Justice Tatel call it, I can't see any question but what Columbia or anybody else who might have any money coming back is going to get that money.</text>

            <text syncTime="3841.493" offset="15469380">They haven't guaranteed anybody that but I say it's rather shocking that they having conceded that the 6 1/8% is just unreasonable to come here to this Court and ask this Court to reinstate the 7% rate pendente lite so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.272" offset="15540433">And just because they say that Tennessee have may have made a mistake in their rate design.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.957" offset="15567182">Well, now consumers are not guarantors either and they can't shift the risk of the natural gas business from consumer -- from the stockholders to consumers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3941.002" offset="15867382">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.506" offset="15889429">I think Mr. Spritzer is to be remanded for his excellent clear statement of the facts of this case.However, before proceeding with my -- with the main body of my argument, I should like to straighten out just three or four items of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.002" offset="15975424">Mr. Spritzer said early in his argument or stated the question early in his argument as being whether the Commission as my notes show, whether the Commission can decide a rate case and reduce rates at an interim stage without waiting until the entire case is completed in all of its aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.058" offset="16071555">Now, we do not agree that that is the question that is presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.111" offset="16103842">The reason we do not agree with that is born out by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="4006.621" offset="16129860">We certainly do not and never have taken the position that the Federal Power Commission lacks authority generally to issue interim rate orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.157" offset="16171969">Indeed, in this very case as the record shows in our memorandum, in opposition to the interim order procedure, at page 592 and that's the bottom -- the number at the bottom of the page.</text>
            <text syncTime="4036.858" offset="16250755">We advise the Commission that we wanted to make it crystal clear that we did not oppose the interim order in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.138" offset="16299969">If the Commission would confine its decision to the -- as it one or two to the issue of rate of return, provided it would at the same time hand down its decision on the hotly contested allocation issue which it had fully heard and which had been fully briefed and which was awaiting decision at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4079.933" offset="16423058">In other words, we told the Commission, we thought the Commission should be equally as diligent in expediting the decision in this case on the very important allocation issue as well as on the rate of return issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="4125.368" offset="16604871">-- it must be decided for the reasons, which I will go into detail in my argument, before the Commission can reduce rates for the reasons I will state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.689" offset="16654085">Now, the Natural Gas Act, it's impossible to order a reduction in rates until the allocation issue where it's contested is decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="4146.062" offset="16687626">Now, there are many cases, if Your Honor please, there are many cases where interim orders can be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.131" offset="16719914">For instance, the case that counsel cited, the Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America case, which this Court would reach this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4163.484" offset="16757321">In that case, an interim order, which was entered into, was a Section 5 (a) proceeding where the Commission was fixing rates prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.849" offset="16794728">Now, in a situation like that and where the company cannot be heard by a retroactive rate making device which would deprive it of its -- which would deprive the company of the very dollars -- of revenue that the Commission itself finds are needed in that situation of course an interim rate order may be entered and this Court so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="4197.743" offset="16894307">I might also point out that in the Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America case there was no allocation issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4204.206" offset="16920221">An order may also be issued validly where there is no contest on allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.482" offset="16941328">Obviously, if the parties are not fighting about the company's method, the company's method it suggests is agreeable to the parties in the case, there was no argument and this has happened many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="4221.754" offset="16990438">It is not every case where allocation is disputed.</text>

            <text syncTime="4550.956" offset="18307218">To file rates under our own methods that are -- is sufficient to recover our cost of service.</text>

            <text syncTime="4768.504" offset="19177409">They ignored the real distinction between an item in a cost of service which is claimed by the companies such as an operating expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="4779.136" offset="19219937">Incidentally, let me point out that over half of these rate increases involved in these three pending cases involves money increases put upon us by our own producers.</text>

            <text syncTime="4793.982" offset="19279287">We get nothing out of that, we simply are accounted to pay to those producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4799.563" offset="19301648">Now, an item of expense or an item in the cost of service can be accepted by the Commission for purposes of an interim order.</text>
            <text syncTime="4810.482" offset="19345324">In other words, the Commission can as it did here and we don't complain about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.347" offset="19360789">They can say, Tennessee we're going to accept you at your word as to every item, every dollar that you were claiming in each of your items in the cost of service such as cost of gas purchase, depreciation, the rate of -- except for rate of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="4829.954" offset="19423169">We'll try the rate of return issue, we'll reduce that $11 million and thereby reduce your overall cost of service by $11 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="4837.736" offset="19454307">So far so good, we don't like the reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4841.452" offset="19469145">We took an appeal from that reduction in the rate of return from 7% to 6 1/8%.</text>
            <text syncTime="4846.992" offset="19491297">We lost that and so we're not arguing or rearguing that here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.177" offset="19508120">We think that is perfectly valid but when the Commission accepts of item in the cost of service for that purpose accepts that no one can be hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4862.994" offset="19555349">We can't claim anymore in dollars than we sought in hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.054" offset="19575620">We can't possibly claim anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="4870.666" offset="19586069">That item has only one way to go and that is down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4874.349" offset="19600802">In other words, at that juncture of the procedure putting aside in the allocation issue, the Commission can properly say, “Your total overall cost of service should be reduced by at least $11 million at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4887.817" offset="19654614">Later on, we may want to reduce that more after we hear the other issues.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.011" offset="19667466">We have no complain about that, if there's no allocation issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4894.943" offset="19683140">But the issue of allocation is a horse of an entirely different view even if it is the method that we suggest that in these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="4905.934" offset="19727130">For this reason, when the dollars of total cost of service or total revenues which the Commission finds are the total dollars that we should have and the total dollars that we're entitle to collect in order to render service properly to our customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4924.411" offset="19801004">When those dollars are divided and distributed to the six rate zones on our system, the -- that must be done in a proper manner otherwise if the Commission uses one method even though it'd be ours, for interim order purposes, and later on, switches around after hearing and uses a different method.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.669" offset="19894000">Then as this case show, we could be harmed millions of dollars and be deprived thereby of millions of dollars of our cost of service.</text>

            <text syncTime="5038.093" offset="20255744">There could be some slight difference but that's immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="5040.934" offset="20267133">Using the same cost of service, which in the case is the staff's cost of service in the previous docket number G-11980, that's the docket where the allocation issue was tried actually.</text>
            <text syncTime="5055.430" offset="20325125">3And the Commission said, they would use whatever method they decided, they're here.</text>

            <text syncTime="5079.611" offset="20421778">If the Columbia method were -- of allocation were used some $23,852,000 of the total cost would be allocated to New England under Columbia's method.</text>

            <text syncTime="5101.431" offset="20509132">In other words, there would be a difference by just by reason of the shifting of cost between zones under these different methods there could be as much as a $7 million a year difference in the allocation in one zone using the same cost -- the same overall cost of service.</text>

            <text syncTime="5220.058" offset="20983620">Here, we would receive or we are now receiving as a matter of fact because we're now operating under the rates which the Commission compelled us to produce $32.9 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="5236.870" offset="21050807">Now, that as Mr. Chief Justice has pointed out was the result of reducing a rate of return by from 7% to 6 1/8% that is total cost service by $11 million and using the suggested method of allocation, which we suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="5252.882" offset="21114859">Now, look at column 2, if Your Honors please, if the Commission had done what we implored them to do, namely to decide that the allocation issue which I think they could have decided that in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5264.897" offset="21162924">Then here's where they would've come out using the identical overall cost of service reflecting the $11 million reduction overall because if you add at the total figures in both of these columns you'd come out exactly the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="5278.496" offset="21217364">Now, using the total same cost of service, you come out -- you would -- the Commission would have found that the proper portion of the total cost of service allocable to New England was $34.3 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="5292.321" offset="21272639">Now, having made reductions under the compulsion of the Commission's order based on a $32.9 million cost of service, we could never recoup assuming that this is what would happened at the end of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5320.905" offset="21386951">We could never get that back because we could not file increased rates retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="5327.114" offset="21411819">We're stuck with a million and a half dollars, which is a part of the very colors of return, which the Commission found just and reasonable and which we were entitled to receive simply because the Commission refused to decide this controverted allocation issue and adopted our method for the temporary purpose as a temporary expedient of getting rate reductions to the consumers.</text>

            <text syncTime="5530.851" offset="22226735">And I'd like to say that further in this regard that the reason basically under the law why we contend that an order of this kind is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.960" offset="22315238">Well, let me first finish up the previous idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="5556.409" offset="22329031">If Columbia -- if Columbia is successful on that appeal, we can be hurt a great deal more than they shown in this table.</text>
            <text syncTime="5567.167" offset="22372080">This table of course reflects that the proposition or the hypothesis that we're going to win all the issues other than the rate of return issue which we have already lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="5577.198" offset="22412204">The table in the Government's brief which appears at the last page of their brief shows what would happen if the Government of if I should say if the Federal Power Commission staff were to be if the Commission's examiner would to be sustain in all of the items of cost of service concerning which we're taking field.</text>
            <text syncTime="5598.980" offset="22499244">So as just Judge Tatel below said, this thing was just too much for him to try to predict what the outcome will be and he said he wasn't going to speculate and I just can't speculate either.</text>
            <text syncTime="5611.058" offset="22547623">I do know, however, that we have been by this order, by this method we have been subjected to the hazard of losing many dollars of our return.</text>
            <text syncTime="5624.280" offset="22600495">The very rate of return that the Commission has said, we were entitled to.</text>
            <text syncTime="5629.398" offset="22620975">Now, the reason, basically, I should've gone to this long time ago but the reason basically why this procedure is invalid it is because as this Court held in the Mobile case the -- under the Natural Gas Act, the Commission reviews rates that are filed under Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="5657.777" offset="22734451">And it can -- but it can't set them aside only upon making a finding that those rates are unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="5667.683" offset="22774053">Now, what we're saying here is that, and what Judge Wisdom said in the majority opinion below, was without first deciding the contested allocation issue, without first deciding what is the proper method to be used to distribute the overall cost to the various zones.</text>
            <text syncTime="5688.997" offset="22859316">The Commission had no basis for deciding or determining which of the filed rates in the specific zones are unlawful the extent to which individual rate should be reduced or to whom refunds are due.</text>

            <text syncTime="5778.167" offset="23216044">And the only reason that took them 18 months as Mr. Spritzer said it did to decide the allocation issue, was because they didn't do what we asked them to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5792.548" offset="23273514">Namely, omit the intermediate decision procedure as they did in the case of the rate of return issue and decide the allocation issues as well as the rate of return issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5803.558" offset="23317608">If they had done that, there might have been a very short delay a few months but they couldn't have been much delay because after this case was finally argued to the Commission after the examiner took a year to hand down as a report.</text>
            <text syncTime="5819.474" offset="23381243">And let me say, he was a very able thorough examiner but he told us that the hearing -- the reason he was going to take a long time to write his report was because he had so much other work to do, he couldn't get to this case for many months.</text>
            <text syncTime="5834.510" offset="23441429">The delay was the Commission's fault in not omitting the intermediate decision procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="6168.793" offset="24778585">We would've been perfectly happy to have the Commission adopt it but not for just one purpose and not for another but for all purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6176.140" offset="24807946">If the Commission adopts our method at the end of the case, that is perfectly alright, we have no complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="6182.094" offset="24831770">And let me also point out if Your Honors please with regard to allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6186.852" offset="24850787">A company is primarily interested of course in recovering its total cost of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="6192.983" offset="24875342">That's what it is interested in, the rules require that company to submit a method of allocation as a part of its filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6201.397" offset="24908988">I like to call that a suggested method because the company can't gain and make a lot of suggesting one method or another method.</text>
            <text syncTime="6209.750" offset="24942320">It doesn't stand to gain a thing because when it submits that method, the rates that are produced by that method, the rates that are produced by applying that method as a total overall cost of service must equal precisely the total overall revenues which those rates will yield at the test year.</text>
            <text syncTime="6229.090" offset="25019747">So we do this, the Commission requires us to do it, we're perfectly happy to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6234.994" offset="25043362">But we don't believe that the risk that is imposed upon us by submitting a suggested method, wherein a case such is this where the Commission has never decided the allocation, one method of allocation should be used suggests -- submits to us a risk similar to that of a game of Russian roulette.</text>
            <text syncTime="6256.643" offset="25129984">Where the Commission will simply take our method from one purpose, only later on to use it for another purpose, and thereby, deprive us of something on the order of -- I don't know how much but it may very well be many millions of dollars of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="6276.469" offset="25209292">Let me say in the very, very few minutes remaining for me because I do want to leave our friends in Columbia some time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6286.035" offset="25247535">I do want to make a quick reference to the three cases that have been referred to by Mr. Spritzer and let me say those are the only three cases in the whole history of the Natural Gas Act up to the time that we made our filing where a Commission -- the Commission had ever entered an interim order.</text>
            <text syncTime="6304.816" offset="25322663">There are only three cases, those are the three up to that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6309.373" offset="25340844">And as to those three cases, they're discussed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6315.292" offset="25364564">I know something about the Panhandle case from which the quotation was read because I try it before the Commission and argued it in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="6323.977" offset="25399254">I know that no such issue was there presented as in here, as was here presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="6329.045" offset="25419525">There, the Commission dismissed four issues one of them being a rate design or so-called you might call it cost allocation issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6339.885" offset="25462888">The Court -- the Commission dismissed that issue because it said, look here just 75 days before you made this new increase rate filing, we had decided, we just decided that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6350.950" offset="25507192">We're not going to go into it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="6353.538" offset="25517537">So, we're going to dismiss that issue along with three other issues that had just been decided in a case -- to the opinion that the Court -- the Commission issued just 75 days earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="6365.144" offset="25563930">So that was the end of the allocation issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="6368.711" offset="25578245">When we went to Court, the Court said, the Commission was well within its rights to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6375.535" offset="25605517">And so, there was no contested allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="6379.253" offset="25620355">The Court just simply said there was no contest of allocation issue in that case and the precise question that is presented here was not raised there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6387.673" offset="25654105">In the Northern case, the Commission in the Northern case as the staff brief admits the precise contention or issues there were not the same as they are here because in that case as in the Panhandle case, the Commission had dismissed the allocation issue because it had been decided and passed on an earlier case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6414.465" offset="25761207">In the Natural Gas Pipeline case of America, as I stated earlier, there was no allocation issue because they didn't have any zones on their system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6421.455" offset="25789210">They had one rate over the whole system and moreover they were not -- they were fixing rates under Section 5 (a) where the rates were fixed prospectively only.</text>
            <text syncTime="6430.831" offset="25826722">Now, just one word then on abuse of discretion, briefly stated here the Commission, and this is the gist of our argument that there was a gross abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6443.944" offset="25879176">Putting apart the requirements of the Act if the Commission had any discretion to exercise in this case, it abused that discretion because here it had a choice of two alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="6456.379" offset="25928913">One, was to decide the allocation issue on the evidence that it then have before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6467.416" offset="25973008">It might have been a very short delay occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="6469.772" offset="25982412">By reason of that, I think it took the Commission only four or five -- four months or five months to decide that issue after the third argument at the second time.</text>

            <text syncTime="7298.390" offset="29296933">In 1955, the Commission formally recognized that this issue existed in the last brief case that was settled and finally determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="7311.065" offset="29347610">That was the so-called Docket G-5259.</text>
            <text syncTime="7315.678" offset="29366105">The issue was raised in that proceeding but the Commission transferred that issue over to a specific docket, docket number G-11980 and it was in 1955 that the Commission itself formally recognized that the issue prevail -- existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="7337.331" offset="29452727">And there was in that same case that Tennessee tried to get made a motion for interim rates and the Commission denied that motion because it said it was improper and that matter was presented to the court below and commented upon in the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="7358.615" offset="29537782">In 1957, the Commission acted to put this cost allocation in this Docket Number G-11980 and it was to permeate, it was to run through all of the other rate cases that followed that were then existing and have since been filed, there are three of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="7383.670" offset="29638092">Now, as I say, Columbia is not merely being litigious and it's not a mere question of a fight on different mathematical methods of cost allocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7401.427" offset="29709040">There's more to it than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="7404.133" offset="29719907">A little bit of history has to be presented to the Court to see why Columbia companies feel so strongly about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="7413.419" offset="29757001">At the outset of Tennessee's corporate existence, they sold most of their gas in West Virginia which was then carried on into Ohio and Kentucky and Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="7428.971" offset="29819277">And about 1950, the complexion started to change.</text>
            <text syncTime="7434.853" offset="29842787">Tennessee begun to expand to new market.</text>
            <text syncTime="7438.396" offset="29856998">They went up to New York and New England also up into Canada and during that period of 1950 through 1958 when this expansion was going on to other markets, they did not expand a very greatly if at all to sell more gas to Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="7458.385" offset="29936933">But even though the expansion and the cost multiplied during that period, Tennessee filed a series of rates ever since 1947.</text>
            <text syncTime="7468.850" offset="29978728">And those rates fell disproportionately upon Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="7473.377" offset="29996910">Now, there's another factor in this history and that is apparently the new -- the expansion in the New England didn't pay out the way they thought it would during this buildup or development period.</text>
            <text syncTime="7486.789" offset="30050513">And so we have the case where Tennessee was not making such a good sales picture in the northeast and so to make their overall return, we felt that the facts show, that the rates seems to be falling disproportionately on us.</text>
            <text syncTime="7506.479" offset="30129298">That's what gave us the impetuous to get in and try to see what was causing this and we fear that we were being made to subsidize the expansion into other markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="7517.460" offset="30173184">We didn't feel that should be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="7520.753" offset="30186350">It's not that we don't want New England to have as low of rate as they possibly can but we think that if the expansion was improvident that it should be Tennessee that would have to absorb the difference and not Columbia companies and the other companies that serve in middle of Appalachian area.</text>
