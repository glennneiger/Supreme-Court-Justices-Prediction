            <label>Mr. Richard A. Solomon</label>
            <text syncTime="11.376" offset="148877">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.317" offset="156609">Just before the recess, we were discussing what we're attempting to do in our area of proceedings and the question that would come up: What about the man whose cost of service is substantially higher than the price that the Commission will fix in any given area?</text>
            <text syncTime="36.144" offset="247933">And I was indicating that this is a problem which the Commission will have to face up to.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.120" offset="267891">I want to make it clear, Justice Black, that there's a very wide distinction at a minimum between a cost-of-service price and a confiscation price.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.096" offset="315747">Obviously, in a cost of service, there are many, many things which go into it which no Court would consider in determining what is a confiscation, for example as a rate of return.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.950" offset="383143">It's hardly confiscatory if a man selling gas doesn't make a 9%, 10% or 11% return on his investments, and yet, a rate of return would go into a cost of service price.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.021" offset="467466">But there will undoubtedly, and let me stress again because I want to make it perfectly clear, whatever the old Commission -- Commission that decided the Phillips case might have thought about area pricing, and I would agree there are certain ambiguities, if you read the Commission's decision in Phillips and a statement of policy, both of which were on the record here, certain ambiguities about the language there exactly as to what they intended by area pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.914" offset="618977">It could be argued that maybe they were talking about contract price, field price.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.352" offset="652831">This Commission is basing its pricing on cost considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.303" offset="676551">But assuming that an individual producer could show that an area price which has been set is confiscatory within the narrow limitations of what is confiscatory, and it could show that this was not because of carelessness or inefficiency or what have you on his part, but because he just hadn't been successful in this business, this mining business.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.370" offset="832867">He had gone around and attempted to get gas and the only thing he'd gotten finally after 15 or 20 or 30 drilling of wells was a little trickle of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.457" offset="889187">I think there are grave doubts as to whether this Court would say because a man on his 15th attempt to drill for a well has gotten a little trickle of gas that he has to be allowed to sell that gas at a price which would allow him in and there to recover all the costs he's put into that.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.569" offset="977690">That isn't the nature of this business.</text>

            <text syncTime="224.862" offset="1002872">-- however, it would be a very natural inclination for them to -- if they're going to take a whole group together by the sea that they didn't hurt any -- anyone particular a company, only six or seven so that you would tend to have as a fixed price, not a maximum price, as a just and reasonable price, the price that might give some people what they considered a reasonable profit and give the others five times as much.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Solomon</label>
            <text syncTime="253.914" offset="1119065">Well, the theory of area pricing does concede that some people who are fortunate or efficient will get more than on a cost of -- individual cost-of-service prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.135" offset="1191894">If Phillips turns out to be an efficient producer, it is possible that when we get through with area pricing, the prices that Phillips gets would be somewhat higher than Company X would get -- no, the prices will be the same, but they will be getting more than they would be getting on a cost-of-service basis, whereas Company X which we can assume is an inefficient producer or unlucky producer would be getting less than they would be getting on a cost-of-service basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="304.568" offset="1321671">I would also assume maybe -- maybe I could be wrong, is when they start to kind of fix some kind of an average price, these contract prices that had been fixed when there was no regulation of any kind and which are pretty well fixed subject to certain procedures whereby they might be held unjust and unreasonable, maybe the average would be figured according to the average of these contract prices.</text>

            <text syncTime="354.993" offset="1523336">I cannot tell you that it will give no consideration to these field prices, what the prices at which gas is being sold in that area, but the basic intent of the Commission is to fix a price for the gas based upon the cost and economic necessities of producing and bringing gas to the market in sufficient quantities so that it will serve the needs of the consumers at the cheapest possible prices to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1657.231" offset="6732257">The examiner filed that Hunt's cost-of-service was way above its revenues -- pardon me, above its revenues that we should dismiss the Section 4 increased rates without refunds and that we should dismiss the Section 5 proceeding along line of Phillips.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.803" offset="6806549">When this came before the Commission, the Commission found it was unable to make any determination as to Hunt's cost-of-service on an individual company basis because the record was inadequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1696.991" offset="6891290">The Commission didn't feel that that was appropriate in view of the fact that, one, this record had been made prior to Phillips when there were no guidelines, and two, the Commission had refused to terminate this proceeding, but it forced Hunt and everybody else to go ahead with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.986" offset="6947297">Under these circumstances, the Commission has remanded this case to give Hunt an opportunity to show, if it can, what its cost-of-service was.</text>

            <text syncTime="1975.277" offset="8004524">And fourth, the Commission determined that this record was inappropriate for the purpose of determining rates for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.374" offset="8036916">Now, each of these basic findings is supported by substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.978" offset="8055306">None of them were challenged in the various applications for rehearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.189" offset="8072129">The first three of these -- I mean or three of these findings have never been questioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.490" offset="8089370">The only finding which has been questioned at all is the finding relating to the subject of discrimination and that issue was raised for the first time after this Court had granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.152" offset="8135973">For the moment, let me deal with the finding that this record was inappropriate for fixing rates for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.451" offset="8165125">To do that, I think it would be helpful to go back and contrast the situation of this case as it was presented to the examiner and as it was presented to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.722" offset="8210265">It became obvious relatively early in these proceedings that cost-of-service, however determined, was going to be in excess of the contract revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.720" offset="8258226">Now, contrary to the statements of Mr. Bennett and Mr. Brown, Phillips was not advocating cost-of-service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.578" offset="8289677">We had gone into this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.449" offset="8297200">We knew that we were going to be met with a cost-of-service and we intended to deal with that subject as best we could by meeting them on common ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.434" offset="8337115">Certainly, it was not our position that cost-of-service was the only way in which this case would be decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.956" offset="8363238">Now, at the -- on the basis of the cost-of-service determined by the Commission, it was apparent as I say, that that cost was going to exceed the revenue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.597" offset="8397720">Phillips took the position before the examiner that if cost-of-service was to be the sole criterion, then under those circumstances, Phillips was entitled to contract rates which would return that cost-of-service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.139" offset="8459891">Consequently, Phillips proposed that the Commission set aside its contract rates and permit it to charge rates higher than were provided by its contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.961" offset="8503254">That contention raised serious objections on the part of many of the interveners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.665" offset="8526033">The examiner touched on -- or did more than touch upon that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.545" offset="8541602">If you will turn to page 75 of the record, you will see there the beginning of a rather extensive discussion by the examiners under the heading, Phillips' right to Section 5 (a) increases under the Mobile-Sierra Pacific arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.965" offset="8611192">The examiner determined that the Commission was entitled to and should set aside Phillips' contracts and permitted to charge rates higher than were provided by its contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.482" offset="8657272">But in the sum -- that finding then was the basis for vigorous exceptions on the part of many, but not all, of the interveners in that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.219" offset="8704293">Some two years and nine months elapsed between the time of the close of the record and the decision of this case by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.535" offset="8737520">During that interval of time, many of the contract prices provided for higher rates, many of the contracts were renegotiated to provide for higher rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.448" offset="8781197">Consequently, by the time this case was decided by the Commission, the issue of whether the Commission should raise Phillips' rates above its contract level was in a sense moot because of the fact that by that time, the contract price is already provided for higher rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.338" offset="8852773">And this was the significance, I think, of the Commission's statement at page 324 and 325 of the record in which the Commission said that this record was not appropriate for fixing rates for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.503" offset="8909406">The Commission says that, “We do not deem inappropriate or require that Phillips file rates for the future based upon the present record.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.037" offset="8935528">The significance of that statement was that it made little sense to the Commission to undertake -- to set aside contracts so that it could raise rates above the level of the contracts only to find that the levels to which it had raised above the contract were then below what the contracts were providing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.237" offset="9016299">Consequently, the Commission said that on the basis of this record, it makes no sense in reason or justice to attempt to fix rates for the future on the basis of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.077" offset="9059662">Now, we come to the question as to whether the Commission should have dismissed or should have reopened this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.661" offset="9085994">With regard to that question, this particular proceeding was first instituted in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.307" offset="9108564">There were already two separate and lengthy hearings in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.473" offset="9133223">It seems to me that it was well within the discretion of the Commission to say that we are not going to continue this already bulky proceeding and reopen it for the receipt of new evidence instead we will set this proceeding down for a new proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.972" offset="9195290">Now, I make no argument as to whether or not the new proceeding ordered by the Commission was or was not the proper type of proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.690" offset="9234160">That I leave to the Commission, but I do make the point that on the basis of the record before it, the Commission was entitled to terminate this proceeding and go forward to some other proceeding and that the findings made by the Commission did support that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.412" offset="9301034">Now, with respect to the 4 (e) proceedings, the Commission did use this record to turn -- to determine that these particular Section 4 (e) increases, had determined rates less and provided revenues less than the cost-of-service while they were in effect and that there was nothing to show that these individual rates were unduly discriminatory or preferential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.016" offset="9395388">Now, I want to emphasize --</text>

            <text syncTime="2324.462" offset="9401240">The question that you've just stated is the only question really before us, isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2330.800" offset="9426526">The validity of the new proceeding is not really before us.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth Heady</label>
            <text syncTime="2336.955" offset="9451186">It seems to me that that is correct, Your Honor, that the only question which is actually before this Court was, whether or not, the Commission was entitled to terminate the Section 4 (e) proceedings, and I emphasize that that question is not really before this Court because of the fact that in the applications for a rehearing, none of the interveners, none of the present petitioners, attacked and challenged the Commission's finding that there should be no refunds involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.610" offset="9561840">Now, there was one exception to that, that one exception was the State of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.640" offset="9577932">Wisconsin in its application for rehearing did contend that there should have been, perhaps, refunds for those rates which are in excess of the average cost-of-service, but that contention was urged only mildly in the Court of Appeals and it has been abandoned here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.552" offset="9645537">Consequently, I question whether we have even the disposition of the 4 (e) proceedings properly before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.118" offset="9675839">That -- but in substance, I agree with -- with Your Honor that that is the only basic issue which is involved if it is properly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.307" offset="9708648">Now, I want to emphasize that these basic findings of the Commission and the dismissal of this proceeding based on those findings do not directly affect any future proceeding involving Phillips or any other producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.413" offset="9769044">Under Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act, as Mr. Solomon has pointed out, the Commission is free at any time to institute a Section 5 investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.764" offset="9802480">The dismissal of these proceedings did not and has not affected that power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.245" offset="9824319">Similarly, with respect to the unconsolidated Section 4 (e) proceedings, those proceedings remain pending as a part of other proceedings, not a part of this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.446" offset="9869145">The Commission has in fact exercised its power to set 5 (a) proceedings by ordering a 5 (a) proceeding with respect to Phillips' rates in the Permian Basin area and the South Louisiana area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.332" offset="9916688">It could this afternoon, so far as Phillips is concerned, institute an order with respect to an investigation of Phillips' rate in their entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.940" offset="9951169">It seems to me that the only question for review by this Court now is whether these basic findings of the Commission authorized the Commission to dismiss these particular proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.410" offset="9997040">The future proceedings and how the Commission should conduct itself in these future proceedings is to me not properly before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.281" offset="10028492">It is simply asking this Court to exercise advisory administrative powers which admittedly this Court does not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.796" offset="10062555">Now, with respect to the Section 5 (a) proceedings and the dismissal of those proceedings, the Commission's power to fix rates for the future is dependent upon the finding that the existing rates are unjust and unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.338" offset="10128697">The language of the act specifically makes that finding a condition precedent to the fixing of rates for the future by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.548" offset="10157537">Historically, in pipeline rate cases, it did not pose any particular problem because of the fact that the Commission has generally found that the existing rates were too high.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.096" offset="10195780">The Commission has then declared those existing rates to be unjust and unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.610" offset="10213857">It has then proceeded to prescribe lower rates or require the pipeline company to file lower rates, but here, the Commission was -- was faced with the opposite of the usual historical situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.051" offset="10259623">It was faced with a situation in which revenues were less than costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.782" offset="10278536">No one now contends that that finding which is unchallenged obligated the Commission to hold that the existing contract rates were unjust and unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.642" offset="10321899">The Commission expressly found that there was nothing to show that they were discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.813" offset="10338617">Under these circumstances, no one challenged the Commission's finding that the record in this proceeding was not appropriate for the purpose of fixing rates for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.738" offset="10374353">All that these petitioners did in substance was to urge an application for rehearing, that the Commission reopen the record if it thought that this present record was inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.408" offset="10413014">But that objection was not that the Commission had failed to fix rates upon this rate, but that the Commission had failed to provide for obtaining a new record in which new evidence might be obtained and that that new proceeding was precisely the kind which these petitioners would desire to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.742" offset="10486366">It resulted, -- so far as the Section 5 proceedings are concerned, the Commission did not find and it was not required to find that Phillips' existing rates were unjust or unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.661" offset="10525968">The Commission did not find and it was not required to find that Phillips' existing rates were unduly discriminatory or preferential.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.955" offset="10555225">But without those findings, the Commission had no power over these proceedings to fix rates for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.037" offset="10579571">The fact that the Commission permitted the existing rates to stand without expressly determining that these existing rates were just and reasonable is not a matter of any significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.963" offset="10623248">This Court made it clear in the Mobil case that the power of the Commission is simply the authority to review rates established in the first instance by the natural gas companies being regulated and to set aside or modify only those rates which it determines to be unjust or discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.544" offset="10705586">A rate once having been reviewed by the Commission and not having been found to be unlawful, stands on its own and is not dependent upon any affirmative finding of the Commission that that rate is just and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.637" offset="10757935">Now, the Court also made it clear in the Mobil case that to this extent, there is no difference between Section 4 and Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.499" offset="10789386">This principle applies to both of those sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.319" offset="10808613">In actuality, the petitioner's contentions that the Commission should have reopened this record are -- are nothing but pleased to the discretion of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.719" offset="10842258">As a matter of fact, I think it's clear that the Eastern Seaboard's contentions are just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.415" offset="10861066">I don't think they have ever gone further than -- than to contend that this was a matter of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.139" offset="10883950">In their view, it was an abuse of discretion, but nevertheless they have treated it as a matter of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.596" offset="10913729">As I pointed out, so far as the -- as the Section 4 (e) proceedings are concerned, it seemed to me that the Commission's findings, its basic findings are as applicable to those as to the 5 (a) proceedings with this one difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.891" offset="10970885">The Commission there did decide that -- and specifically the question of refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.871" offset="10998888">It determined that in view of the fact that the cost-of-service was in excess of the revenues and the fact that the existing rates were not shown to be discriminatory, that there was no basis on which to attempt to order refunds of those Section 4 (e) increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.707" offset="11070151">Now, the Commission did point out that since those increases have been superseded by later increases and therefore were no longer in effect and that the later superseding increases were the subject of other and separate pending Section 4 (e) proceedings that this record was not an appropriate place in which to attempt to establish future rates for these Section 4 (e) proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.070" offset="11167640">It seems to me that on -- on the basis of its finding in this proceeding that the Commission did precisely the only thing it could do with respect to this Section 4 (e) proceeding and that was to hold that no refunds were required and that these particular Section 4 (e) proceedings should be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.167" offset="11244022">With regard to the Hunt case, which has been discussed here to some extent, one contention made by the petitioners here is that that case holds that the mere fact that total cost-of-service exceeds total revenue may not always be relied upon to sustain individual rate increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.781" offset="11326464">That finding, of course, was based upon the record in the Hunt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.903" offset="11342973">Whatever findings and whatever decisions the Commission may have made on the basis of the Hunt case so far as this record is concerned, the Commission did hold that the mere fact that an overall cost-of-service exceeded the total revenue did justify these particular increases because of one, the fact that cost exceeded revenues and secondly, the fact that there was nothing to show that the individual rates were discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.657" offset="11458017">The Commission was not required to make any further inquiry so far as Phillips was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.272" offset="11476511">Perhaps for Hunt, I don't know what the record showed in that proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.724" offset="11498245">There's one other matter regarding these Section 4 (e) increases that might bear some slight discussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.114" offset="11531786">One other attack was made upon these -- on three of these Section 4 (e) increases by California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.600" offset="11553729">These contract provisions provided that the -- whenever the wholesale commodity index had increased by a prescribed number of points and the purchaser from Phillips had obtained a general increase in its rates, then Phillips was entitled to a proportionate increase in its rates, proportionate, that is to the increase received by the pipeline company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.284" offset="11636485">These are the clauses which California designates as the so-called Spiral Escalation Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.203" offset="11660204">California nowhere contends that these increases were not justified by Phillips' cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.242" offset="11684342">As a matter of fact, the three increases involved were to levels which were less even than the average unit cost-of-service determined by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.563" offset="11717674">California's contention is simply that the mere existence of these contract provisions in some way violated some unstated public policy and that the Commission should have rejected these increases without even considering the question of whether the increases were required or justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.190" offset="11784129">California never states precisely why it is that the mere existence of these contract provisions should violate some public policy, especially in view of the fact that any increase provided by them must be justified on other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.217" offset="11840240">Now, California in its brief seems to be attempting to create the impression that the Commission allowed these increases merely because of the contract provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.264" offset="11880469">But quite to the contrary, all that the Commission did was to consider these contract provisions authorized Phillips to utilize the rate filing procedures of Section 4.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.565" offset="11925608">That's all that the Commission considered that these provisions did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.594" offset="11937729">Phillips was required to justify these contract provisions on other grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.239" offset="11956328">To that extent, the Commission treated these contract provisions no differently than any other contract provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.661" offset="11982033">In this instance, the Commission determined that these particular increases were justified on the basis of Phillips' cost and California has never contended otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.330" offset="12020694">Certainly, there is no public policy which would require or even permit the Commission to ignore these contract provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.893" offset="12050996">In fact, California seeks a retroactive amendment which would deny Phillips the right to file an increase to which it is admittedly entitled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.088" offset="12095718">These particular provisions have been upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.722" offset="12118288">Similar or -- provisions providing for indefinite increases at indefinite times had been upheld by other circuits and in fact by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.799" offset="12162591">It would have been obviously a clear error under those circumstances for the Commission to have rejected these increases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.365" offset="12192789">In summary, let me say that --</text>

            <text syncTime="3322.432" offset="13393063">I would respond first to Mr. Solomon's suggestion that the real question here is whether the Commission should be compelled to go down two roads simultaneously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.389" offset="13452936">I suggest to this Court that the question is whether the Commission may refuse to go down any road during the time while its area rate experiment is in progress, whether it can in fact abandon a known road simply because it's rocky in favor of an unknown road which has not even been chartered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.072" offset="13559620">While this experiment goes forward, and I would remind the Court again that the companies for whom I speak are not opposed to the Commission's going forward with its area rate experiment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3376.466" offset="13609253">They are actively engaged and presumably will continue to assist the Commission in its efforts in this regard, but while the experiment is in progress, while it is going forward, refundable, bonded dollars are being collected at the rate of $158 million annually, $ 22 million of those dollars are Phillips'.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.062" offset="13703607">Now, Mr. Solomon suggests that the Commission is basing regulation on a cost-of-service basis and indeed, it is in part as is reflected by its own evaluation of the examiner's decision here and its own opinion 338 in this case, as it has reflected in the Hunt decisions, which are before you, opinions 365 and 369, as it is already going forward, at least it's -- did in the Permian Basin procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.718" offset="13826278">The Commission does indeed recognize the need for some relationship between the revenues of a company and its income or -- and it's -- and it's requirements in terms of revenue.</text>

            <text syncTime="3493.451" offset="14077158">Mr. Justice Goldberg, I think that we – to answer the question in several ways, first of all recognize that Phillips Petroleum Company itself, this single company, represents 10% of the jurisdiction of gas being sold in this country today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.205" offset="14144240">It represents alone as much gas as being considered in the entire Permian Basin proceeding, so it is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.537" offset="14173497">Now secondly, as far as time is concerned, indeed it did take time to try this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.119" offset="14195858">We started back in 1957 and the record was long, and there were many false starts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.625" offset="14221876">The parties who participated in this proceeding had many suggestions to make as to how to proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.480" offset="14245282">The examiner sit through the week [Inaudible] in -- in a -- in an extraordinarily patient and capable way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.194" offset="14272136">The Commission then considered this and the Commission resolved many of these issues so that in consequence, a great deal of ground had been plowed in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.264" offset="14312469">And indeed, the -- the -- the ground plowing that has been done here by the examiner has been followed by other examiners and they have learned their lessons from this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.261" offset="14352384">The Commission has in consequence in the -- in the proceedings in which the company by company approach has been used and we list them incidentally, some of them in our Appendix A, a great deal of progress has been made and much, much less time, in my opinion, would be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.355" offset="14428766">And third and finally, if this is a relative matter, if it's a matter of relating how much time is going to be required to finish this case at long last on the one hand as compared with going forward on the area approach and conceivably by mid-1964 finding the rates for the Permian Basin procedure -- producers, 35% of Phillips' gas being there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.956" offset="14523225">If it's a relative thing, I would point out that many of the legal issues which are going to be involved in the Commission's decision of the first area price proceeding are going to be long and complex and complicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.130" offset="14591875">Now, this is not necessarily to condemn it, but simply to say that it is that kind of question which it seems to me we will not get if the Commission here decides the Phillips case on a company by company basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.913" offset="14639000">The discrimination, confiscation argument which Mr. Justice Black discussed with Mr. Solomon this morning, one of the -- one of the virtues of a -- of a company by company approach is that at least it enables the Commission the examining authority to weigh and evaluate all of the costs of the company on the one hand and all of its revenues on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.577" offset="14733667">Then by prescribing or first letting the company come in with a schedule of rates to return that cost-of-service, there may be some positive assurance that the company is at least recovering its cost-of-service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.256" offset="14784345">That is -- that is one of the very important major benefits and advantages of the company by company approach, which incidentally poses a very serious problem in the area price proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3791.868" offset="15270849">They have gone in to the field and each time they seek either to construct a new line or to expand an existing pipeline, they require a substantial major block of gas.</text>

            <text syncTime="3804.961" offset="15323199">And it has been their experience in the past that each time they do, and this by the way is in your CATCO decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.312" offset="15352665">I think this is fully discussed there, each time they do, the gas price simply reaches a new higher plateau.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.084" offset="15379728">So that in sum, I would say that the experience in the marketplace and the field has been that gas seeks to be sold in a seller's market and any pipeline which seeks to buy it is going to have to pay or even buy a major block of gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.246" offset="15452348">You're going to have to pay at least as much as or slightly more than the last highest price in the area.</text>
