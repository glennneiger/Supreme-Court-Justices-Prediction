            <label>Mr. Philip R. Monahan</label>
            <text syncTime="40.740" offset="266324">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.184" offset="284087">This case is here on certiorari to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals to review a judgment of that Court, setting aside a deportation order on the ground that Section 212 (a) (4) of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act as applied in this case is void for vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.603" offset="397772">The facts are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.817" offset="414595">The respondent is a 50-year-old native and citizen of Switzerland.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.913" offset="443016">He is unmarried and has no children or dependents.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.841" offset="462764">He was admitted for permanent residence to this country in October of 1952 and has resided here continuously since then with the exception of a period of something less -- something less than a day when he made a trip to Ensenada, Mexico in August 1956 following which he was readmitted to the country at San Ysidro, California as a returning resident alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.925" offset="599124">In April, 1959, the Immigration and Naturalization Service issued an order requiring him to show cause why he should not be deported as an alien who prior to entry, and the entry in question was the reentry of August 1956 which I might say parenthetically at this point constituted an entry within the explicit definition of entry in the 1952 Act, why he was not deportable as an alien who prior to entry was convicted of an offense involving moral turpitude, consisting of his conviction on his plea of guilty in the California Superior Court for the County of Los Angeles of a homosexual act committed in February of 1956 for which he was sentenced to a fine of $200.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.713" offset="858258">The respondent appeared at the immigration -- at the deportation hearing with counsel acknowledged the truth of the factual allegations underlying the order to show cause, conceded his deportability, indicated that he desired to be deported to Switzerland and was ordered deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.780" offset="950523">He indicated that he did not desire to take any appeal and he did not appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.554" offset="973615">However, in July of that year, on the motion of the prosecuting officer of the Service, the proceeding was reopened on the representation of the Service that because of certain technical Escape Clause in the Act which I -- which is explained in our brief and which I will not attempt to explain here, the offense underlying the outstanding deportation order was not one that was deportable in itself because it came within the definition of a mis -- a misdemeanor classifiable as a petty offense as defined in the immigration laws and therefore in itself was not deportable.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.525" offset="1173504">However, the Immigration Service requested that the proceeding be reopened for the introduction of an additional charge of deportability which is the one presently before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.962" offset="1227212">That charge was that he was in it -- he was deportable because he was inadmissible at the time of his August 1956 entry as an alien afflicted with psychopathic personality.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.172" offset="1308087">In support of the additional charge, there was received in evidence, a certificate by a physician of the United States Public Health Service certifying that the respondent was a psychopathic personality and had been such at the time of his entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.184" offset="1392097">Dr. Dahlgren, the Public Health Service physician who signed the certificate was -- testified at the hearing and was subjected to cross-examination, and he testified that -- he acknowledged that he was not a psychiatrist himself but that he had classified the respondent as a person afflicted with psychopathic personality because the official instruction book of the Public Health Service called The Manual for the Examination -- Medical Examination of Aliens, requires that any alien who is a homosexual or sexual deviant, be placed in the category of a psychopathic personality.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.529" offset="1585507">He stated on cross-examination that he had no particular opinion or no particular feeling or words to that effect as to whether the respondent would be considered a psychopathic personality under traditional medical standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.986" offset="1675368">In addition, the record of a second conviction of the respondent, one which preceded in time, the one I've mentioned before, it took place in 1953 which was also based upon a homosexual act as the respondent admitted at the hearing was received in evidence for which -- and the record shows that the defendant or the respondent rather was sentenced to a $100 fine on that occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.505" offset="1805354">It was also received in evidence a sworn statement, a sworn statement by the respondent which appears at pages 74 to 75 of the record which the respondent made to an investigator of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in March, I believe, of 1959, and which he acknowledged at the deportation hearing was true, in which the respondent stated that he had had homosexual urgence since he was a young man of 24 in Switzerland and that in the intervening period of 22 years, he had indulged in homosexual activities whenever the opportunity presented itself which he said was on the average of about once a month.</text>

            <text syncTime="491.869" offset="2070862">It was made in March of 1959 during the course of the Service's inquiry into the man's background, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.766" offset="2122480">He further stated in this affidavit that his homosexual activities had begun in Switzerland and that he had never been caught or arrested in Switzerland that they had continued in this country and that he was unfortunate enough to be arrested for them in a public park in Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.521" offset="2213491">He acknowledged that both his 1953 and 1956 convictions were based upon homosexual acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.132" offset="2239927">He stated that he was arrested on a third occasion in Oxnard, California in 1958 for similar activities but those charges were dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.442" offset="2285171">And he stated that since his second Los Angeles arrest or conviction rather in 1956, he had been very careful with respect to his homosexual activities because he had heard that such things were reported to Washington and he felt that the Immigration authorities might be looking for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.063" offset="2367613">On the respondent's behalf, there was received in evidence a report in the form of a letter to the respondent's then counsel, predecessor of present counsel, I believe, by his personal psychiatrist, Dr. David Harvey, in which Dr. Harvey stated that he had -- had examined the respondent on four occasions between May and August of 1959, and it acknowledged that the respondent had had homosexual activities since the age of 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.038" offset="2491538">But in which he stated that the man's sexual drive particularly at his age, is thought to be within his range of control especially if he is under the supervision of continuing contact with a psychiatrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.293" offset="2548590">And in which he further stated that his socioeconomic relations were consistently good, that he did not frequent homosexual hangouts, had no evident interest in nudes, manifested no irresponsible trends, and had his main social contacts with respected members of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.388" offset="2632913">Dr. Harvey further stated that the respondent's deviation, to use his word, was not sufficient in his opinion to warrant the classification psychopathic personality, and that the formal label should be or would be sexual deviation, homosexuality now under control.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.071" offset="2727685">The special inquiry officer at the conclusion of the hearing determined that the addition -- the additional charge had been supported because on the undisputed evidence, the respondent was and at entry had been a homosexual.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.111" offset="2803858">And he referred to a prior decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals in which the Board, on the basis of a thorough analysis of the legislative history of Section 212 (a) (4) of the 1952 Act had concluded that Congress -- that there could be no doubt that Congress intended to exclude homosexuals and sexual deviants within that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.626" offset="2921827">The petitioner, following an unsuccessful appeal or rather the respondent following an unsuccessful appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, sued for injunctive and declaratory relief in the North -- in the District Court of the Northern District of California in which he challenged the sufficiency of the Service's finding of psychopathic personality and in addition contended that the term was unconstitutionally vague as it had been applied in his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.826" offset="3050663">The District Court finding that -- that there was certainly ample evidence to support the finding that he was and in entry had been homosexual held that on the basis of the legislative history, it was clear that he was also a psychopathic personality within the congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.659" offset="3134046">The Court rejected the contention that the term ‘psychopathic personality' was unconstitutionally vague with the observation that while it might be true that a criminal statute which employed such a term might be too definite to be sustainable, too indefinite to be sustainable, the same strict standard of definiteness should not be required of a statute which merely defines the classes of aliens who are inadmissible to the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.976" offset="3255254">The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the phrase was unconstitutionally vague as herein applied and that resort might not be had to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.450" offset="3301125">The Court, while recognizing that the respondent's deportation had not been ordered on the basis of his miss of -- of any conduct in this country, but because of a disqualifying condition at the time of his entry, held nevertheless that the Immigration and Naturalization Service's reliance in part in making its finding as to the existence of that condition on behavior by the respondent in his country, made the application of Section 212 (a) (4) to his case fundamentally unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.983" offset="3451277">The Court's rationale is set forth in -- on page 96 of the record where the Court said, “Insofar as the record reveals continuance of homosexual practices after Fleuti entered this country in 1952 and again in 1956 was not compulsive, but was a matter of choice.”</text>
            <text syncTime="861.867" offset="3550856">It follows that if by reason of vagueness, the statute failed to advise him that homosexual practices conclusively evidenced a psychopathic personality, Fleuti was substantially prejudiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.034" offset="3611460">As in the case of a vague criminal statute, he would thereby be deprived of notice that unless he refrained from such conduct, harsh results might follow.</text>

            <text syncTime="1021.910" offset="4190960">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals did think that because the service had considered the activities in this country, homosexual activities in this country, in part, in arriving at its determination that at least we do not rest, we do not rest upon the acknowledgment by the respondent of his homosexual condition in 1956.</text>

            <text syncTime="1361.606" offset="5549746">What the Court of Appeals has done in this case is to extend in a wholly unprecedented manner, the fair warning doctrine, and has converted it into a rule which protects -- which would protect resident aliens from inadvertently furnishing evidence to the Immigration officials showing them to have been afflicted with a disqualifying condition at the time of their entry.</text>
