            <text syncTime="37.717" offset="254203">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court pleases; this case comes here on writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit denying the enforcement of what we describe as a grievance award.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.289" offset="324524">Since the genesis of the case is on the filing of a complaint in the District Court, and since the lower courts made their determination on the basis of a motion to dismiss, holding that the facts alleged in the complaint were not sufficient to predicate a cause of action or claim for relief, the only facts which are really before this Court are those facts which are pleaded in that Bill of Complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.878" offset="430895">The operative, operative facts may be summarized as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.105" offset="447822">The petitioner Local 89 is a local labor organization, having its office in Louisville, Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.179" offset="472064">The six individual petitioners are members of Local 89 and they are represented by Local 89 for the purposes of collective bargaining with an employer who is the respondent here, Riss &amp; Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.737" offset="534340">Riss &amp; Company is an interstate carrier of freight having among other places in this country, a terminal in Louisville and one in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.020" offset="575404">There is a collective bargaining agreement between Local 89 and the Riss Company which its counterpart has been before this Court on a number of occasions before, it’s Exhibit A in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.312" offset="632665">It’s a multiemployer, multi-union, multi-state contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="162.108" offset="751783">They are actually the same that we're also able to translate and in the Nebraska Short Lines case, Local 524 (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="170.910" offset="786996">The contract contains, among other things a provision called “protection of rights”, which provides that it shall not be a violation of the contract, and it shall not be cause for discharge if any employee or employees refuse to go through the picket line of the union, or refuse to handle unfair goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.260" offset="892426">Incidentally I should say that, as many times and as many lawyers who have read the record in this case, I noticed for the first time last night that a very important word, the word “not” was omitted from the complaint as printed in the record but the contract clause itself is as I have read it, in the contract attached to the record and in the opinion of the Court itself that is quoted incorrectly as being, “It shall not be a violation of the contract”.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.057" offset="995558">The record would indicate that it shall be a violation of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.168" offset="1012067">The validity of this clause incidentally has not been challenged in these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.941" offset="1035160">The Riss &amp; Company had a labor dispute with a local union in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.555" offset="1073612">That local union sent its pickets to Louisville, to picket the Riss terminal there.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.692" offset="1106108">Exercising the right, assured to them by this contract provision to which I referred, these six petitioners, members of the union and employees of Riss refused to go through that picket line and they continued in such refusal for approximately three weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.912" offset="1195029">It was in early 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.060" offset="1207568">They then offered to return to work and presented themselves for work.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.300" offset="1228570">However, the company refused to permit them to return.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.439" offset="1249155">Accordingly, they filed a grievance under the provisions of this contract in which they sought reinstatement to their employment, wages from the time that they had offered to return to work and were refused such right to return, some vacation pay which had accumulated, and also requiring the employer to make certain contributions to a Health and Welfare Trust Fund which provided hospital and medical and sick benefits for the employees, and certain contributions to a Pension Trust Fund which provided pensions at age 60.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.621" offset="1413831">These contributions are predicated according to the contract on so much per employee per each week worked and go into the Trust Fund and do not go to the pocket of these six employees who were then denied their right to return to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.037" offset="1467538">The grievance procedure itself is set forth in Article VII and Article VIII of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.295" offset="1496586">Article VII establishes a series of committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.262" offset="1516440">All of them are bipartisan committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.943" offset="1531173">There's equal representation by the employer, equal representation by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.425" offset="1553115">There is a local area committee which first considers disputes and controversies if the parties cannot settle them directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.642" offset="1593971">If the local area committee cannot settle the dispute, it goes to what is called a Local Joint State Committee, again a bipartisan committee which makes an effort to settle the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.972" offset="1639215">And if they do not settle the dispute, or if it is a matter of interpretation, it goes to what is known as a Joint Area Committee, which is a larger committee comprising representatives of the unions and employers in a multi-state area.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.435" offset="1697102">In all instances, if there is a majority vote in either committee as they go up, that will settle the dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.371" offset="1740884">If the two lower committees are deadlocked, it goes up automatically.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.727" offset="1758229">When it reaches the top committee, if there is a majority decision then that dispute is finally settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.727" offset="1790307">If there is no majority decision at that point, then the parties are free to use the vernacular, grab their best holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.112" offset="1823848">They may, if they desire submit to umpire handling.</text>

            <text syncTime="584.552" offset="2441592">It directed to that the company do pay up its contributions which were delinquent in both the Health and Welfare and in the Pension Trust Funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="600.520" offset="2505435">And because of that refusal, that the complaint which I have just summarized was then brought in the Western -- Federal Court for the Western District of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.578" offset="2537723">I would like to emphasize at this point, at respondent's brief refers to many other facts in addition to those which I have just outlined here.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.604" offset="2577742">Those are facts which the respondent alleged in its answer and counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.656" offset="2601984">They are not facts in the record for the purpose of this case, since this case was decided on a motion to dismiss based upon the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.075" offset="2635630">So I would call to the Court's attention that whatever additional facts may be brought to the attention of the Court with respect to whether this was a strike, with respect to whether there were threats, with respect to the nature of the picketing is not and was not before either the District Court, the Court of Appeals or this Court, or the -- and was not before this court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.138" offset="2719953">The complaint sought precisely the same relief which was granted to these six employees by the Joint Area Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.591" offset="2761749">The respondent, in making answer to the complaint asserted as its first defense that the complaint did not state facts upon which a claim for relief could be based.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.180" offset="2816084">It went on to refer to the fact that there was a state court suit pending in which the respondent, the employer was a plaintiff in which he was seeking damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.498" offset="2857357">It said that the stoppage or the recognition of the picket line was in fact a breach of the contract and therefore it was not required to submit to or nor was it bound by the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.365" offset="2908871">And that grievance procedure for that reason was a sham and made a counterclaim for the damages it suffered as a result of this refusal to go to the picket line subsequently, an amended complaint was fought -- a counterclaim was filed for injunction, an effort to restrain the picketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.306" offset="2972609">None of these matters came to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.601" offset="2981804">Issue was not joined on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.911" offset="2991000">At a pretrial hearing called by the District Judge, consideration was given to the motion to dismiss and the Court made a very simple order saying, “On a motion to dismiss, it is granted for lack of jurisdiction on the authority of Westinghouse”, the Court reading Westinghouse as precluding a claim of this kind because it was -- for the benefit of these six individual petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.861" offset="3098833">On appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, the lower court's order and judgment was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.485" offset="3133315">This Court went beyond however, the reason given by the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.676" offset="3154108">It did say that there was no jurisdiction under Westinghouse because in the words of the Court, the purpose of the action is to recover for the individual plaintiff's lost wages together with incidental benefits to the union based on payment of wages to employees, but the Court also went further.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.477" offset="3233311">It said that the decision of the Joint Area Committee was not an arbitrational order, therefore, Lincoln Mills and the other cases were not aptable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1004.751" offset="4122415">Well, the Court did say that there was no finality here, but as I read it that the Court was not saying that a final decision in the Joint Area Committee was not final but because it was opened and reading the bare words of the statute, it was not the kind of a contract clause which was before this Court in Lincoln Mills or the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.156" offset="4199946">And the Court also went on and decided that it would construe the contract itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="1155.676" offset="4726053">We get then to this problem which we believe is implicit here as to whether or not, as the complaint here was framed, we are suing on an award under these circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.403" offset="4797001">The -- and I suppose candor would require us to say that when this bill of complaint was filed back in 1960, we were acutely aware of the Westinghouse case and its implication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.585" offset="4861680">Surely, we were not certain at that point as to how we would fare in the Federal District Court on a claim which sought to vindicate the individual rights and employment and back wages as well as the union's right in the interpretation and maintaining the integrity of its agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.675" offset="4950079">And this case was presented through the Courts and is presented here on the theory that, what happened in this proceeding was of the nature of an award, it was in fact an award although it does not have all of the classical trappings of the arbitrator, the impartial party selected by the parties to the agreement to come to a decision as to what the parties intended by their agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.974" offset="5087274">The procedure we believe fully qualifies as an arbitration, in that, it is a determination made by a group of representatives on the dispute submitted to them for the purpose of determining the meaning and application of a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.112" offset="5183822">It is a formal procedure and the decision, certainly partakes in all sense the nature of an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.866" offset="5226872">The only distinction being that this was not a matter submitted to an impartial outside tribunal umpire for that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.905" offset="5266996">There's nothing that we read in the cases of this Court on the definitions of what is an arbitration or what is an award which requires that a particular grievance procedure and a decision arising out of that procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.744" offset="5342333">In order to be classified as an award must follow any particular road or must be involved in any particular, specific formal procedure which perhaps may be characteristic of arbitration clauses which had been before this Court in the Steelworker cases or in Lincoln Mills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.952" offset="5459153">I think that all of these cases and the law indicate that the important thing is that the parties agree among themselves on a procedure for the settlement of their disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.054" offset="5507636">The law does not adjure them to adopt any particular or special procedure, but that if the procedure by their likes is well calculated and would in fact solve their problems in the manner which they believe is best for their industry, that procedure is not subject to attack or should that procedure receive less support in the courts in cases of this kind because it is not the classical procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1540.291" offset="6264560">This case under the -- a similar grievance procedure, an employees sued this respondent saying that the grievance procedure was unfair as to him because although he had been restored to his job, he didn't get back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.851" offset="6322761">And he sought in court, then in the state court, an additional award of back pay and this respondent was there arguing the integrity of virtually the identical grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.254" offset="6376364">And I say that the only change of position here is this argument now made that there was a breach.</text>

            <text syncTime="1581.459" offset="6429236">This was the agreement of the parties, that they would determine among themselves how to apply this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.073" offset="6459643">I would make just this last observation in connection with the point that we had structured this lawsuit on the assumption that we would be confronted with Westinghouse when we got here that even if this is not considered an award, it is an interpretation or an agreement by the parties to the contract who are authorized to make such interpretation or agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.498" offset="6569357">As such, it becomes a part of the contract, and at such the contract in toto maybe enforced by these petitioners, the union and its members.</text>

            <text syncTime="1977.142" offset="8011943">Thus in substance, making every grievance award tantamount to an order or to a judgment of the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.243" offset="8060322">Is this true especially as in this case where there is no binding effect where there is no finality to the contract in question as well as the grievance procedure outlined therein.</text>

            <text syncTime="2032.195" offset="8232103">Is there concurrent federal jurisdiction without the customary removal procedure?</text>

            <text syncTime="2062.904" offset="8354983">Now the pertinent facts are briefed in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.983" offset="8371284">As Mr. Previant pointed out on January 25, 1960, the six individual petitioners were employees of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.855" offset="8398764">The Union at Philadelphia, Local 107, the same international union, sent them some of its own members to the local terminal on the morning of January 25, 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.411" offset="8445053">And these individuals from Philadelphia commenced carrying and displaying conspicuously strike signs with reference to this respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.369" offset="8480893">Without any notice whatsoever, in contrary to various and different provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, these six individual petitioners immediately abandoned their respective post of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.552" offset="8537631">Early in the morning, they left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.582" offset="8549752">None of the petitioners, including Local 89 to which they belonged, sought negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.195" offset="8580159">They did not ask for settlement, arbitration as provided for in the written contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.796" offset="8598549">To the contrary, these six individual petitioners went to the outer entrance of the respondent's terminal and proceed to and did march back and forth near the entrance carrying signs captioned, “Local 89 on strike” and “Riss there is a strike” and physically threatened customers, invitees and other employees of the respondent in acting in concert with each other did strike, commit a tort and work stoppage, all of which are continued for a period of several weeks and without making any attempts of whatsoever to invoke the grievance procedure in violation of the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="2291.085" offset="9267702">It is an order of dismissal in connection with that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.245" offset="9288391">I notice on page 22 of petitioner's brief that they referred to the [Inaudible] case and quoting, it says that we cannot make findings of fact different from the allegations of the pleadings and affidavits upon which summary judgment or dismissal was entered below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.457" offset="9365191">It would appear from that statement that there is no distinction between the order of dismissal or from the summary judgment and the word pleading was used rather than just a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.941" offset="9407091">So I would construe from their citation themselves at any pleading, any fact, any allegation and any pleading in the record which is not controverted or which is not the matter would have to stand on its own face.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.443" offset="9457142">Again, I've like to make it clear in fairness to Mr. Logan that he says that these facts were controverted, I shall refer to his judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.868" offset="9482846">In continuing, a brief with the factual issue, on January 28, 63 days after this incident occurred and while these men were still on strike line, the respondent filed a suit in the Jefferson County Kentucky Circuit Court and it involves the same issues, the same people and all of the petitioners are duly before that Court and they have filed responsive pleadings and the restraining order was entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.076" offset="9599666">Now, because of the abandonment of their post, the respondent had to go ahead and did go ahead on February 1st and make arrangements for other employees to carry out the functions of those who had left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.336" offset="9648671">Now, these individual petitioners and there's no question about this did not file any grievance whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.571" offset="9681690">They did not bring up with the counsel or with any other agency desire or expressing a desire to have grievance arbitration and what have you, they left.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.441" offset="9729128">Now, the only time the grievance came about was on February the 15th when they returned after pickets, and they had gone back to Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.410" offset="9757027">And they came back, these six petitioners and asked to be replaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.748" offset="9778343">At that time, the respondent advised them that it had already made other arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.346" offset="9796733">And with the case with which this Court's [Inaudible], the case of International Association of Machinist, Lodge 1652, versus International Aircraft Service, I believe this is in their brief, a citation of that is 302 F.2d, page 812 and I quote, “It is a well set of rule that an employer may fill positions left vacant by employees going out on economic strikes and that he is not later bound to displace men hired to take the strikers places in order to provide positions for them” and they cite numerous decisions in connection with that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.259" offset="9968410">Now, insofar as the argument may be concerned, I feel that is of interest to this Court, to perhaps look back just a tiny bit into the wording and to get a general overall brief understanding of this Act which we are confronted, and Section 301 is included in this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.830" offset="10054719">Now reading all, the Labor Management Relations Act as amended, produces a profound and an articulate realization that such Act was never enacted by the Congress for the purpose of settling individual monetary disputes between employer and employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.839" offset="10130683">To the contrary, we observe in Section 1 of the same Act under the heading of a short title and declaration of policy that neither labor nor management “has any right in its relations with any other to engage in acts or practices which jeopardizes the public health, safety or interest.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.455" offset="10225142">Now I ask, was this done in the instant case, of course not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.593" offset="10249697">Now the same session provides that it's the purpose and policy of the act to provoke the full flow of commerce and to deal with situations “which affect commerce and are inimical to the general welfare and to protect the right of the public in connection with labor disputes affecting commerce.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.802" offset="10322631">Also, Section 101 of the same Act, it says that and I quote, “It is here by declared to be the policy of the United States to eliminate the causes of certain, substantial,” this word “substantial” is used in various places throughout this Act, “Substantial destructions to the free flow of commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2708.525" offset="10937448">On page 9 here, the Section F to an umpire for decision, that is what the parties had in mind if they arrived at the point where they themselves, this is an interfamily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.554" offset="10993560">This grievance award is merely a vehicle by which the parties themselves in their own families try to work it out and which is -- there's nothing wrong with that, but they realized and they recognized from reading this contract and this Court will too by looking over that they realized their inadequacies that Mr. Previant has pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.736" offset="11086346">And if they get to a point where they cannot agree, then this umpire handling or arbitration, formal arbitration which this Court has held time after time is enforceable by the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.514" offset="11137442">But this Court has never held to my knowledge that a grievance award, a true grievance award and as this Court knows or at least in this situation, lawyers and parties are not permitted at this local level conferences where they get together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.421" offset="11205047">They are not based or they're not fashioned to the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.478" offset="11225318">They are prepared for the people who get together and they work it out, they enter an order, but there is a great difference between the arbitration award and the grievance award.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.636" offset="11273906">The arbitration award is won where the parties mutually agree that they will have federal mission -- mediation board, American Arbitration Association or some other capable person to come in and to listen to their dispute and permit counsel to present the facts for consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2840.567" offset="11465644">Oh, incidentally, this contract, the copy of the entire contract was filed with a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.225" offset="11492289">And I understood that it was made a part, the contracts made a part of the record and went to the Sixth Circuit and also to the record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.096" offset="11523741">But in the transcript itself, the section to which I refer is Subsection G on page 9 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.043" offset="11567522">Now, let us see and this is what destroys or one of the things that destroys the finality or the binding effect of this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.791" offset="11610572">This provides that the failure of any Joint Committee to meet without fault, the complainant said, “Refusal of either party to submit or to appear at the grievance procedure at any stage or, undermined, failure to comply with any filed decision withdraws the benefits of Article VIII.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.867" offset="11686849">In other words, if either party fails to comply then the union has its right to economic recourse, to strike or to picket and they have, I assure you, relied upon that because more than two years, August 1960 up to the present time, they have relied upon that because it had pickets in front of respondent's terminal in Louisville and they are there today unless they withdrawn this morning or last night.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.047" offset="11791548">So, that is not binding upon either of the parties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2931.306" offset="11828642">Yes, we feel that the respondent feels that under this particular situation that this contract was breached in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.743" offset="11862392">When these men left their positions without any request for arbitration and joined the picket line that breached the whole thing because I have to point Your Honor also that on the next page, page -- though the -- apparent to that is not in this record here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.171" offset="11956015">The page or the following page -- Subsection H of the -- of this particular contract, page 24 of the record provides -- yes, Subsection H. Down at the bottom of page 24, Subsection H down at the bottom, nothing herein shall prevent legal proceedings by the employer where the strike is in violation of this agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.298" offset="12076596">We have pleaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.187" offset="12080149">We have alleged that the strike was in violation of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2997.981" offset="12095300">We have pointed out, it was on page 9 of the record and I'd like to direct the Court's attention to this part that says, “Its Article VIII, the unions and the employers agree that there should be no strike, lockout or illegal proceedings without first using all possible means of the settlement as provided for in this agreement of any controversy which might arise.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.147" offset="12175966">And then following that, dispute shall first be taken up between the employer and the local union involved failing adjust,” but then they go ahead through this grievous procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.180" offset="12216090">So we will submit that these provisions of this contract have not been complied with by the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.128" offset="12259871">In our brief to the Sixth Circuit, I would like to mention in fairness to the record concerned that the question was raised on page 8 and which is not a part of your record here, assumed of the brief which was filed there, but question of reaching of this contract was raised and the Sixth Circuit in pursuance of it, went ahead and held that this contract was not a finality, it was not a final thing, this contract here because the theory of it is quiet apparent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.767" offset="12382438">If these two parties themselves cannot agree upon a binding contract, they reserve the right there, either one pulls out, they don't appear then it's not but a binding performance of either of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.338" offset="12432697">The economic recourse may be had or legal procedures maybe instituted by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.056" offset="12459551">So, if these two parties themselves have agreed that there shall not be a binding contract between the two of them, then I will submit to the Court that it is not equitable for if the petitioner or them to ask this Court to make a binding agreement for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.869" offset="12530813">It is certainly incongruous and inconsistent and will not hold water, but this last point which -- the last provision of the contract which we refer is one mentioned by the Sixth Circuit in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.141" offset="12591940">It held, yes, they respect the right for these employees not to cross a picket line, but there is another section of that same section, other subsection of Article IX and that is on page -- record is on page 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.773" offset="12710431">Apparently, the Article IX is not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.825" offset="12726627">And I don't know how that occurred, but I've searched my own folder, it is not, but the Article IX was referred to in a decision of the Sixth Circuit and it quotes, “It quotes it and so it is in the record and I quote this portion of it which it must read into the record with which is before the Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.881" offset="12806875">We're talking about these employees where they say that they did not have to cross the picket line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.431" offset="12833102">And this is the section which the Sixth Circuit read into it, had to read with the other one to get the full meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.268" offset="12856404">The insistence by any employer, that his employee handle unfair goods or go through the picket line after they have elected not to and if such refusal, -- refusal has been approved in writing by the responsible officials of the Central States Driver's counsel shall be sufficient cause for an immediate of striking of all such employers operations without any need of the union to go through the grievance procedure herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.882" offset="12958908">Now there is no allegation that that was complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.965" offset="12971238">There could not be an allegation because it was not complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.774" offset="12986493">So, in view of that, it destroys completely and wholly the breadth, the vitality of this collective bargain agreement if it is one but I doubt it, it is a binding one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.475" offset="13041246">The Court has said there is no finality to it because either party can get out of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3365.954" offset="13567143">The same wording this grievance has pointed out of the same type of contract has been included in the Yellow Transit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.639" offset="13597968">And in that case Mr. Justice Brennan, they've announced the opinion and in that case, in referring to this Article VIII, the question arose as to whether there was a binding contract there for arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.612" offset="13665782">The wording is either identical or extremely comparable and this is the statement of this Court and its opinion, “Since it is clear that the collective bargaining agreement involved in this case does not bind either party to arbitrate any dispute, we agree that no injunction should be granted.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.197" offset="13756165">That is the decision of this Court in a recent case, also the case of Hoover Motor Express Company versus the same union in 217 F.2d 49.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.531" offset="13809455">They held that the contract, the same contract which we have here before us, the wording is identical, did not contain an arbitration clause, it must be mutual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.897" offset="13862954">There is no binding effect upon either party to submit to classical or formal arbitration under the terms of this particular contract because it must be mutual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.892" offset="13910915">So therefore, there is not a binding effect as far as this contract might be concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.654" offset="13946023">The Sixth Circuit injected based upon the briefs or at least upon the respondent's brief, this question of whether they had the right to go off their jobs, participate in the strike and then come back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.650" offset="14013942">Now, I would like to point to the Court that if this grievance award were given legal effect, it would mean that every grievance award upon the local level involving thousands and thousands of unions and people would have the same effect if on the local level, they entered into a grievance award and take it to a federal court and then it would go ahead and be the same or tantamount to a ruling of the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.654" offset="14134000">I do not believe as what Congress had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.664" offset="14142046">I do not believe that that was this Court has in mind at all, because we know as this Court point out of the Westinghouse case that nowhere in the legislative history that Congress ever show any recognition of this type of suit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3526.712" offset="14210173">Insofar as this Evening News case is concerned, I'd like to address the Court's attention to the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Black in which he gives an excellent evaluation in which I'll not try to repeat but he states that in order for this Court decide whether the suit brought from this case is one of the types which an in -- that individual can bring.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.064" offset="14299617">One thing is certain, that case held that the state courts have concurrent jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="3592.414" offset="14473070">What the Evening News case has held, I agree with Mr. Justice Black that perhaps I'm on the same dilemma, maybe he is, but one thing is certain, this Evening News case gives no precedent for the facts involved in this case authority with the permission of the Court, pursuant to the rules of the Court or you want to get an early decision of this but if you give the respondent 10 days to file a supplemental brief and the petitioners 10 additional days to comment upon the fact, we feel that this case has, well, it would be very much appreciated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.017" offset="14611414">In that way, in 20 days, we'd have both the supplemental briefs in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.184" offset="14624057">In conclusion, I would like to point out that yesterday, Mr. Justice Goldberg referred in a very appropriate analogy to history and to logic, I would like to use that same phrase here this morning [Inaudible] that there has been no history, no conversional history in the background of this legislation to indicate that this type of a case was ever intended to be turned lose upon our United State District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.981" offset="14751326">From a logical standpoint, I submit, with all the sincerity at my command, that if this type of case were presented to our federal courts that only catastrophic results would be had and chaos and confusion would be the in line.</text>
