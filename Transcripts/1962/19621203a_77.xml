            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">Number 77, John R. Jones, petitioner, versus W. K. Cunningham, Superintendent of Virginia State Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.269" offset="220453">Mr. Meador.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel J. Meador</label>
            <text syncTime="30.890" offset="226931">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.981" offset="243336">This is a habeas corpus case which has been dismissed by the Fourth Circuit as moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.165" offset="272071">The petitioner who is a state prisoner, had been placed on parole while his appeal was pending, and the court below considered that thereafter, he was not in custody within the meaning of the habeas corpus statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.700" offset="338213">The question presented is whether a prisoner who has been unconstitutionally convicted and who is now on parole is to be denied any remedy in the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.673" offset="390040">In urging that he has a remedy, the petitioner relies on two propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.491" offset="409370">The first is that a writ of habeas corpus is available to a paroled prisoner because he continues to be restrained of his liberty when he is transferred from the custody of the penitentiary superintendent to the custody of the State Parole Board and is compelled thereafter by the Board to live in a particular town, in a particular house, to work only at a designated job and generally to confine his activities to those things which the Board directs.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.059" offset="547610">The second proposition is that even if habeas corpus is held to be inappropriate, the action should not be dismissed but should be treated as a declaratory judgment action and the constitutional claim thereby adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.044" offset="615528">Now, if it please the Court, I’ll leave the second part, the declaratory judgment issue to the brief and focus discussion here on the habeas corpus question.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.160" offset="667982">This action was commenced in the Federal District Court for Eastern Virginia in February 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.759" offset="702360">At that time, petitioner was confined at the Virginia State Prison Farm under a 10-year recidivist sentence which is the same sentence under which he continues to be held now on parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.449" offset="765158">That sentence was based on three prior convictions, one of which was a larceny conviction, a conviction for larceny of an automobile in 1946.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.684" offset="806118">In the petition filed below, it’s alleged that at that larceny trial, the petitioner -- petitioner’s constitutional right to counsel was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.230" offset="844257">It’s clear under the decisions in the Virginia and the federal courts that if this larceny conviction is constitutionally invalid, the recidivist sentence which is based on it is also invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.199" offset="892217">Petitioner alleges that at the larceny trial in 1946, the petitioner was then 20 years old that he had no money, he had no lawyer, he was not told that he was entitled to counsel, he was not aware that counsel could be appointed for him and that he did not waive his right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.997" offset="971316">The state in its return filed in the court below admitted that petitioner was not represented by a counsel at the larceny trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.170" offset="1012067">However, the state put forward two grounds for dismissal of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.341" offset="1028786">One was that the petitioner had already had a hearing on his constitutional claim in the state court and was not entitled to any further hearing in the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.153" offset="1067969">The second was that the circumstances surrounding the larceny trial in 1946 did not constitutionally require the appointment of counsel under the line of cases stemming from Betts against Brady.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.184" offset="1124080">The District Court relied on those two grounds in dismissing the petition without a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.159" offset="1151979">Thereafter, the petitioner took steps to appeal his case, still representing himself, he never had a lawyer up to that point, and he appealed to the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.663" offset="1198059">The Fourth Circuit granted leave to proceed in forma pauperis, granted the certificate of probable cause and appointed counsel to present the appeal for the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.227" offset="1240273">The case was then put on the calendar for argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.708" offset="1250200">Briefs were filed by both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.152" offset="1263992">The day before the case came on to argument, June 1961, the respondent filed a motion to dismiss the appeal on the ground that it was moot since the petitioner had been granted parole and within a few days, he would be released from the State Prison Farm on parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.018" offset="1351450">Attached to this motion to dismiss was a copy of the parole order, the order issued by the Parole Board, granting parole and setting forth all the terms and conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.621" offset="1401814">That order is a key document in this case and if the Court please, I’d like to call its attention to it in the record at page 20.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.596" offset="1437759">The order is backed up by Virginia statutes, one of them specifically requires a parolee to comply with all terms and conditions prescribed by the Parole Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.399" offset="1488959">Now, the order is directed to the petitioner from the Parole Board, if the Court will notice on page 20, the second paragraph of the order, “you are placed under the custody and control of the Virginia Parole Board.”</text>
            <text syncTime="362.192" offset="1552175">Now, there is a Virginia statute which also says the same thing in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.940" offset="1571088">It says the -- a parolee is in the custody of the State Parole Board and I mentioned at this point that the word ‘custody’ is the very word used of course in the federal habeas corpus statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.154" offset="1632005">Then coming to the middle of page 20, the last long paragraph, there that 12 general conditions set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.609" offset="1665860">They are very sweeping and broad, some of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.704" offset="1674219">I call the Court’s attention particularly to condition (f), “Do not leave or remain away from the community where you reside without permission of your parole officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.615" offset="1721866">You shall not change your residence without permission from your parole officer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="409.800" offset="1742555">Condition (h), “You shall not own or operate a motor vehicle until you have received written permission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="418.079" offset="1775679">At the top of page 21, the general condition there, condition (l), “Follow the parole officer’s instructions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="426.276" offset="1808488">Then we have special conditions that direct the petitioner to live at the home of Mr. and Mrs. McKinney, his aunt and uncle in LaFayette, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.547" offset="1853524">I’m told that that’s the way to pronounce locally.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.034" offset="1867525">He is directed also to work for his uncle, Mr. McKinney, a plumber and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.761" offset="1902425">For following the filing of this motion to dismiss, the case was argued in the Fourth Circuit on the merits of the constitutional claim and on the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.309" offset="1952580">And thereafter, three days later, the petitioner was placed on parole and proceeded to LaFayette, Georgia where he has remained ever since under the terms of the parole order.</text>

            <text syncTime="478.937" offset="2019140">Petitioner’s court appointed counsel at that point promptly filed a motion to bring in the members of the Virginia Parole Board as parties to the case on the ground that they now had custody of the petitioner and not the penitentiary superintendent.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.085" offset="2091760">In September 1961, the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal as moot, explaining in an order that petitioner was no longer in the custody of the originally named respondent, Superintendent of the Penitentiary and that he --</text>

            <text syncTime="518.412" offset="2177024">It did not grant petitioner’s motion to bring in the Parole Board members and it held that he was not in the physical custody of the Parole Board.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="529.300" offset="2220596">Was there a formal denial Mr. Meador of the motion to substitute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_j_meador" startTime="534.325" stopTime="628.820">
            <label>Mr. Daniel J. Meador</label>
            <text syncTime="534.325" offset="2240658">It's only in the course of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.539" offset="2249540">There is no order denying that motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.479" offset="2261243">It’s clear though from the opinion that it was being denied in the -- it wasn’t granted in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.355" offset="2296769">Thereafter, this Court granted a petition for certiorari, limited to the issue of mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.440" offset="2321115">Therefore, the merits of the right to counsel claim are not here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.661" offset="2342013">Now, petitioner’s basic contention here is that the narrow view taken by the court below as to the availability of habeas corpus is simply out of line, out of harmony with the spirit and purpose of the writ and the historic usage of the writ for the last -- at least the last 200 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.703" offset="2438144">The test of the availability of the writ, that is the test for the meaning of custody in this context which is really synonymous with restraint of liberty, the test is not close confinement or physical incarceration or imprisonment behind locked doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.159" offset="2519960">The test is whether the petitioner is deprived of the freedom to go when and where he would otherwise have the right to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.177" offset="2560084">That is whether on a realistic appraisal of the facts, the petitioner is subjected to special restraints on his liberty, on his mobility, restraints which are not imposed on society generally.</text>

            <label>Justice Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="628.820" offset="2618702">Mr. Meador, in that action, did he address himself to this comment on page 31 of the Supreme Court -- of the Court of Appeals where they said that really the custody and parole was not a real custody because anybody, any citizen who performs the acts that were specified of the parole order would be subject to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.034" offset="2719535">Do you think the citizen would be subject to arrest if he didn’t keep good hours, he didn’t keep good company?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_j_meador" startTime="660.958" stopTime="961.576">
            <label>Mr. Daniel J. Meador</label>
            <text syncTime="660.958" offset="2747225">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.358" offset="2748792">That precisely is our point that the -- we have here a whole array of restraints to which the citizen generally is not subjected.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.205" offset="2784214">A citizen generally is not told where to live, where to work, what hours to keep, persons to associate with, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.789" offset="2814516">Now, it’s true, one of the conditions here is that he obey the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.178" offset="2832071">Everyone is subject to that, but there are many, many others here to which citizens generally are not subject to and even that condition, even the condition that he obey the law has consequences here that are not ordinarily present.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.673" offset="2886092">Should he violate a municipal ordinance or any other statute, he is subject to rearrest and re-incarceration without any further trial which is something people generally do not live under.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.157" offset="2936038">Now, our proposition is that restraints within the formula which seems historically supportive.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.936" offset="2967071">Restraints may be imposed in a great variety of ways other than by locked doors and prison walls and the parole order in this case backed up by the Virginia statutes makes it plain that this man is circumscribed realistically by a great array of restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.647" offset="3037915">The Virginia statutes which are in the appendix in petitioner’s brief compel this man to obey the terms of the order or be subject to arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.047" offset="3087548">He may be arrested with or without a warrant for violation of any condition which includes any instructions the parole officer might care to give him.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.818" offset="3126627">And upon being rearrested he may be re-incarcerated without an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.765" offset="3150451">Petitioner really is in a twilight between the penitentiary and freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.001" offset="3171349">That’s what gives rise to the difficulty in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.095" offset="3183783">He is certainly not a free man. However, he is not confined in the penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.483" offset="3205308">It’s just halfway point which modern penology has evolved, gives rise to this difficulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.818" offset="3234670">However, look at his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.976" offset="3243238">His entire life is subject to official supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.430" offset="3261106">Every move he makes is merely by official grace and by official sufferance.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.047" offset="3287542">People with whom he associates, the job he holds, the places he goes, where he lives, all of these things which we think of really as being of the essence of freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.939" offset="3327143">The absence of these things is what we associate with a totalitarian state, police state.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.279" offset="3360475">Therefore, when a man in our society is deprived of these things, and is deprived of his freedom in these ways, I would say that freedom writ -- writ of habeas corpus is available to adjudicate and test the legality of those restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.988" offset="3427349">And there's nothing novel really in using the writ for this purpose and to test the legality of such restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.080" offset="3463711">In our brief, we have set out numerous examples from history, some modern, some old in which people have employed the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.536" offset="3497566">Persons illegally inducted into the army have brought habeas corpus to test the legality of the induction.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.124" offset="3527868">Children in custody, the legality of that particular custody has been adjudicated by habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.716" offset="3550229">These people are not physically incarcerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.227" offset="3560260">They are not prisoners in jail, yet they're under restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.802" offset="3574575">The apprentice server in the 18th Century had available of the writ to test the legality of the indenture under which he was held.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.551" offset="3617625">That’s an interesting historical incident because the parolee today is a direct descendant of the old indentured servant.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.349" offset="3648763">The indentured servant is an ancestor of the parolee, the modern parolee.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.135" offset="3667884">All of these people, parolees, indentured servants, people in the army, children in someone’s custody, all of them have in common the fact that they're in the control of someone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.801" offset="3710621">And this element of control seems to be the key here, in the control of someone else under special restrictions on mobility and liberty which are applicable to society generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.059" offset="3763597">And this is all custody means in the habeas corpus statute in this context and the writ is not tied to any one form of restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.884" offset="3806960">It’s not narrowly limited to prisoners in jail and with all due respect, it seems to me that the court below failed to take adequate account of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.858" offset="3854817">All that was necessary to prevent this case from becoming moot was to bring in, enjoin or substitute the members of the Parole Board in place of the penitentiary superintendent.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.109" offset="3907793">The Parole Board, the members of that Board and now the officials imposing the present restraint, they now have petitioner in their custody.</text>

            <text syncTime="1025.104" offset="4203813">On the first point that there was no other respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.319" offset="4212694">The appropriate respondent there, apparently, would’ve been the Attorney General of the United States because by virtue of statute he has custody of a parolee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.688" offset="4254072">It would be my impression if he would not be within the territorial jurisdiction of the District Court, that case came out of the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.766" offset="4286464">I don’t know the district, but I would assume he was not within the reach of the District Court’s process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.736" offset="4314363">I have not been able to find any motion to substitute was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.743" offset="4338395">Moreover, I would add this about Weber and Squier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.345" offset="4352711">It was a denial of certiorari on a stated ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.063" offset="4367653">It would appear that by having granted certiorari in this case, the Court considers the question not necessarily foreclosed by Weber and indeed, this is the first time the question has been before the Court for plenary consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.810" offset="4426585">So all in all I would consider the question open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.870" offset="4446856">The Parole Board meets another requisite for a habeas corpus respondent and that is that it has power to produce petitioner in the Federal District Court in response to the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.973" offset="4519267">In conclusion, I would simply point out two features about this case, one is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.218" offset="4560227">The Parole Board itself expressly says that it has custody of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.853" offset="4590738">The Virginia legislature also expressly says that the petitioner is in the custody of the Parole Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.536" offset="4629504">So, it seems that the state is hardly in a position here to say that the Board does not have custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.950" offset="4659179">The state can hardly deny that which its own Board and its own legislature say is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.526" offset="4685511">Now, there is another point which the state has never denied in this case and cannot deny and that is that the petitioner still today remains a prisoner of the State of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.983" offset="4735352">And he is a prisoner under an unexpired sentence imposed, so he asserts and with considerable merit I think, in violation of his constitutional right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.720" offset="4782268">It seems to me clear from this Court, in Congress, and our legal tradition generally that a man in that position is not to be left wholly without any remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1242.571" offset="5073690">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.239" offset="5084348">I think that the facts as outlined by counsel for the petitioner in the case at bar are roughly correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.375" offset="5108903">It would seem to me, however, that there is one constitutional infirmity in the petitioner’s conviction which has not been discussed by Professor Meador and that is the fact that under the decision of this Court in Chewning versus Cunningham, his recidivist sentence is invalid because he was not represented by counsel at that time, but that I think is immaterial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.449" offset="5197197">The -- this case hinges on the scope of the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.996" offset="5219349">That is the whole point that I think that we have before this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.489" offset="5241292">Beginning on page 5 of our brief, we have outlined, succinctly we hope, our understanding of the writ of habeas corpus, the fact that an order for it to lie, the man must be a prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.112" offset="5299806">And we rely on McNally versus Hill, we have cited some language in that case on page 7 of our brief and I would like to read to you that a portion thereof which I think is particularly pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.535" offset="5353514">This Court said the writ in its historic form like that now in use in the federal courts was directed to the disposition of the custody of the prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.806" offset="5390608">It commanded the officer to have the body of him taking in our prison under your custody together with the day and cause of his being taken and detained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.917" offset="5431045">Now, under what wild stretch of whose imagination can a superintendent of the Virginia State Penitentiary produce this man before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.616" offset="5481827">Let us assume for purposes of argument that the Court should hold that the writ does lie, that the case would go back to the District Court and the Court should hold that he is entitled to his immediate release.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.582" offset="5541700">That Mr. Cunningham would then be served by United States marshal with the order to release John R. Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.041" offset="5571584">The best Mr. Cunningham could do with that order is witness files because Mr. Jones is not long -- is no longer in the custody of the superintendent and has not been in the custody of superintendent being in the state penitentiary since June 26, 1961.</text>

            <text syncTime="3084.054" offset="12439594">In summation then, we would say this, that in the first instance, the writ only lies when he is in custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3090.826" offset="12466657">Secondly, even if he were to or rather certainly, under the present situation with W.K. Cunningham, the Superintendent as the respondent, the writ does not lie because he’s not under custody of this respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.964" offset="12519215">If the court below was in error in failing to grant the motion to substitute the Parole Board and if this Court should grant that motion then even if the Parole Board is there, the man is not within the jurisdiction of the Eastern District of Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.633" offset="12585880">In other decisions of this Court, the writ does not lie. Now, that is briefly our position insofar as the cited cases are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.385" offset="12620884">Moreover, we take the position that under the rules of this Court and the rules of the Fourth Circuit when he is released from custody and he is released from the custody of the respondent and nobody can argue with that and we can get into it -- to a differentiation of opinion perhaps, the difference of opinion as to what the Virginia statutes mean, but the -- under the rules of the court when he is released, he is released and he is released from custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.948" offset="12723179">The matter becomes moot under Rule 49(1) of this Court and that is briefly our position and the premises.</text>
