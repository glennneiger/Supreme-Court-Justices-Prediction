            <label>Mr. Richard D. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="8.628" offset="137906">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.220" offset="152221">Upon the adjournment yesterday, I had been addressing myself as to our view as to what law applies to this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.854" offset="194748">Any dissent below and adopted by the Government in its brief, the point is strongly made that the substantive law of the 50 states would apply and be the determining factor as to whether or not a cause of action could be brought under the Tort Claims Act in this type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.991" offset="287326">The Government by adopting that position claims that the application of the substantive law of the 50 states would create a situation whereby the uniformity of the federal prison system would be undermined.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.444" offset="365171">Now, we hold that these fears are groundless and that the substantive law of the state in this particular situation does not apply but rather that the cause of action herein is based upon the law of the place which in this particular case is grounded upon uniform federal law through the Constitution as cited in Logan against the United States, and particularly based upon the duties which are imposed upon the Bureau of Prisons, the full statute of which is set forth in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.156" offset="515950">And so, we claim that the action of Congress in enacting the statute imposing the duties upon the Bureau of Prisons has made this subject a federal matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.161" offset="576031">Very much a federal matter as Congress considered the question when it enacted what is known as the Federal Range Code which is referred to on page 12 in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.672" offset="626082">In Hatahley against United States, where interpretation of that code was involved, the Court said, “It is clear that both the written notice and the failure to comply are express conditions precedent to the employment of local procedures.”</text>
            <text syncTime="146.997" offset="691388">The code, that is the federal code, the Taylor Grazing Act, “Is of course the law of the range and the activities of federal agents are controlled by its provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.077" offset="731721">They are required to follow the procedures there established.”</text>
            <text syncTime="161.150" offset="748022">These provisions of the federal code were of course obliged to become the law of the state or the law of the place in interpreting what law governed that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.596" offset="793788">And the Court went on further to say at page 180, “We are faced with the question of whether the Government is liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for wrongful and tortuous acts of its employees committed in an attempt to enforce a federal statute which they administer.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.168" offset="856064">We believe there is such liability in the circumstances of this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="192.748" offset="874350">And a similar recognition of reliance upon federal law, where Congress enacted under a certain set of facts was followed in Hess against the United States cited on page 13 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.716" offset="934222">It is our contention that with or without a statute or with or without the common law of the State of Connecticut permitting this type of an action to be brought, the very fact that Congress has imposed upon the Bureau of Prisons certain duties establishes this cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.032" offset="1015515">And we say that the State of Connecticut and the District Court in interpreting what law is to be applied here must apply the federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.578" offset="1057729">That is the law of the place.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.242" offset="1084374">We contend also and the subject has already been alluded to by Mr. Abt that the Tort Claims Act gives rise to a cause of action under any situation accepting for those specific exclusions which are set forth in the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.394" offset="1156995">And in Hatahley, and in the Brown against the U.S., and in Brooks, of course this was the rule that was very clearly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.865" offset="1190849">We distinguish Feres, not only on the grounds which have already been set forth to the Court but further on the grounds that national policy, the very fact that troops maybe in one day by themselves or as a unit in California, the next day in Washington, the next day in New York, and then perhaps overseas requires as a matter of policy that no action can be brought for negligence when they are being transported or otherwise in active service because there is a certain function which soldiers are required to perform and they must be by reason of their mobility free or the Government must be free from any claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.512" offset="1373393">Now, so far as the position of the Government is concerned in respect to this question again of the variance of the laws of the 50 states, we would point out that the standard of care which is to be applied in the negligence case is as a very general proposition quite uniform throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.604" offset="1485824">There is no great variance in the 50 states as to a standard of care, the application may vary sometimes to some degree but the standard is rather uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.434" offset="1541099">In the Government's brief, the difficulty that the courts would have in finding a standard to apply in the type of claim brought by Muniz is commented upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.396" offset="1604942">Well, if there is no standard for the courts as the Government claims, surely, we can by reading the statute imposing the duty upon the Bureau of Prisons, no specific standard there either.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.997" offset="1647365">The duties are imposed but there is no standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.130" offset="1663875">What that means is that the courts are to set the standard of care under this type of situation under hornbook law.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.768" offset="1706402">The courts have always set the standard of care in negligence cases under hornbook law.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.082" offset="1727718">And we do not find that there would be any great difficulty on the part of the court in interpreting what is applying the standard of care in this type of situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="460.801" offset="1946624">Well, I would think that confronting the problem for the first time at this moment, that if an action was brought, that relief could be granted and I don't think that the Court should have the discretionary power to in anyway affect the right of the claimant to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.392" offset="2064906">If the Court had the discretionary power, the exercise of such discretion might ultimately result in the elimination of the course of action -- of the cause of action completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.353" offset="2104822">In the case of one who is sentenced to death, I dare say that the fact of the -- rather, sentenced to life imprisonment, such sentence would not necessarily -- would not necessarily extinguish the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.732" offset="2166262">In New York State as a matter of policy, there can be no such action brought but that has been a decision which the New York authorities have felt is proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.599" offset="2209729">I don't think it necessarily follows but that would have to be uniform in every situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.165" offset="2231986">The Government's contention that discipline would be undermined very much by the questions which you pose, Mr. Justice Goldberg, I think perhaps somewhat overstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.323" offset="2284648">We must remember that in these situations, unlike the situation of the soldier in the Feres case, who was mobile and moving around the country and in the sense a certain free agent, every inmate of these institutions is under custodial supervision 24 hours a day.</text>

            <text syncTime="582.223" offset="2432293">On the other hand, Muniz and all of the other prisoners in federal institutions are controlled 24 hours a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.572" offset="2461654">They're in that cells or they're under the eyes of the guards.</text>

            <text syncTime="669.800" offset="2782542">But of course we must remember that an action which would be instituted would take place after the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.442" offset="2809187">And the facts that would come out in the discovery proceedings would be the existence of the security arrangements at the time the incident occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.554" offset="2841579">How many guards were involved and what guard did what?</text>
            <text syncTime="688.020" offset="2855476">It would be many months after the occurrence of an act that these discovery proceedings would take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.066" offset="2875643">And any information that might be revealed would deal with the situation at the time that the alleged tort occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.867" offset="2902810">And so, I don't think that there would be any great loss of information or any great hazard created by the revealing of such information.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.237" offset="2956309">Now, the Government also claims in respect to problems of discipline that there may be this desire on the part of the inmate to come to court in the lessening of security and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.913" offset="3003016">It causes a practical matter, most of these actions brought under the Tort Claims Act would be brought under circumstances where there's an attorney involved with the vast majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.557" offset="3041573">And it's unlikely I think to say that an attorney would bring an action of these circumstances to assist the -- and in the Feres purpose a prisoner may have in mind is not to say that a prisoner couldn't take the trip to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.051" offset="3087548">But these are the risks that we face and then this is the price of maintaining a Government which is fair to all people.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.602" offset="3121821">The competency of the courts was alluded to by the Government in its brief and they feel that the courts who would find it very difficult to judge what is the proper standard of care.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.345" offset="3172707">And I remarked before that of course the courts in negligence cases have consistently ruled in these matters as to what a standard of care -- what the standard of care should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.756" offset="3218369">The issues decided by courts previously have been far more complex than the ones posed in the Muniz case.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.745" offset="3242402">And certainly, experts are available to assist the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.230" offset="3264240">In the eyes of Muniz, the wording of the Tort Claims Act that any act may be -- any action may be commenced accepting for the exceptions noted in the statute means that Muniz of course has a right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.303" offset="3340622">If the Government's contention is that the impact upon the prison system would be so severe that this should not be allowed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.061" offset="3375626">And that you should read an exception into the Act, we say, “Let Muniz sue.”</text>
            <text syncTime="823.283" offset="3396524">If the legislative authority which enacted the Tort Claims Act comes to the conclusion after its investigation that Mr. Muniz in this type of situation should not be allowed to sue in the future, then the legislature itself can enact and further exception to the Tort Claims Act impure of such situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="912.635" offset="3753880">If this contention is to be carried out, then this would be one of the few areas of Government where there is no judicial review of the duties which are imposed by statute upon certain segment of Government operations, all Government acts by and large are reviewable whether the cause of action is for money damages, mandamus, injunction, breach of contract, some form of action gives judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1032.491" offset="4233383">And in respect to the actual charge on which Mr. Muniz was sentenced, though he was an addict and being treated as an addict, the actual basis of the violation was postal -- adopt the postal money ordinance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1050.716" offset="4306213">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.422" offset="4329096">Perhaps, the most conspicuous gap in the respondent's case is that in broadly arguing that no ill effects will attend the allowance of prisoner suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.599" offset="4373817">They always avoid talking about the really troublesome class of cases of which the Muniz case is a classic example, those directly challenging actions, policies, and procedures for the maintenance of prison order and security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.927" offset="4443094">One finds the same gap in the decision below as the dissenters pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.398" offset="4460962">The majority analyzed the whole question of prisoner suits in the context of the Winston case, whose facts of course do not present the problems with which we are concerned in nearly their most serious form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.323" offset="4512684">And then it's simply reversed in the Muniz case, the truly hard case on the basis of the Winston opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.994" offset="4543300">Whatever may be thought of prisoner cases generally, if there ever was a class of cases in which Congress could not possibly have assumed -- could not possibly be assumed to condone judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.209" offset="4600247">It is in cases like Muniz where the challenge is to a guard's action in quelling an incipient riot to a warden's determination as to the size and the placement of his guard staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.818" offset="4650611">For such challenges go to the very essence of the complex subtle means by which penological objectives are attained, thus in its allegations of insufficient guards, the Muniz complaint challenges the whole rehabilitative philosophy of a minimum security facility such as the one at Danbury, Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.295" offset="4740577">The ratio of guards to prisoners that such a facility is determined of course on the basis of what must be recognized by all as a calculated risk, a fine and sensitive balancing between the likelihood under one hand that some prisoners may escape, that there may be some violence, and on the other hand, the proved advantages for rehabilitation to be gained from placing trust in the prisoners and allowing them a reasonable degree of freedom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.668" offset="4854053">To subject such determinations to judicial review would be only to invite a serious retrogression in rehabilitative and correctional procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.166" offset="4896057">For problems in this sensitive area can always be avoided by more rigorous order, stricter discipline and tighter security.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.571" offset="4933674">The incident in the Muniz case could doubtless had been avoided by a substantially higher guard-prisoner ratio or on harsh restrictions, by imposing harsh restrictions on prisoner freedom.</text>

            <text syncTime="2049.547" offset="8301589">Well I would -- I would make two points, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.530" offset="8317471">First, all of those bills, I might say were 10 years at the very least.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.158" offset="8347982">Ten years prior to the passage of the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.199" offset="8360208">So that any presumption that the members of Congress who passed the Tort Claims Act that we're aware of them is somewhat strained but more to the point in the Feres case, precisely the same situation was present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.090" offset="8419767">There had been a number even more tort claims bills prior to the passage of the Tort Claims Act, excluding military claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.659" offset="8458010">And this Court said in Feres that this again was an unrealistic way of interpreting the Tort Claims Act.</text>
