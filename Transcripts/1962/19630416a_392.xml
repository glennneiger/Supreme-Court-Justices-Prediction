            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="11.739" offset="150340">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.767" offset="166431">During the opening of my argument yesterday, I was showing that the Federal Communications Commission has a comprehensive jurisdiction over radio broadcast and particularly over the programs and programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.342" offset="248769">The view of the Commission with respect to its powers which come under the licensing authority as I was seeking to develop is perhaps best set forth in a passage quoted from one of its statements of policy beginning at the bottom of page 19 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.220" offset="324211">Broadcasting licensee as the Commission said, must assume responsibility for all material which is broadcast through their facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.971" offset="359215">This includes all programs and advertising material which they present to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.763" offset="382412">With respect to advertising the material, the licensee has the additional responsibility to take all reasonable measures to avoid any false, misleading or deceptive matter, and to avoid abuses with respect to the total amount of time devoted to advertising continuity as well as the frequency with which regular programs are interrupted for advertising message.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.132" offset="471855">Now, that is not simply and idle declaration.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.217" offset="488260">The Commission has consistently in determining whether to renew a license or to revoke a license taken into account the character of the programs and particularly the character of the advertising by a station.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.853" offset="558791">For example in one case, the Commission sustained in the examiner's finding that a radio station had been guilty of a breach of its duty as a licensee because it engaged in what was known as bait and switch advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.386" offset="620962">And in another case, one of the grounds for failing to renew a license was that the radio station had run a so-called “Medical Question Box”, answering questions about health and then advertising or offering prescriptions from the sale of which it received commission the same way the Commission has on a number of occasions expressed its concern about advertising of beer and other malt beverages in states where their sale was prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.662" offset="753977">And only recently the Commission scheduled a proceeding to determine whether it should promulgate some kind of a rule or standard on the amounts of time of which may be developed to -- may be devoted to advertising.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.657" offset="862020">I do not mean to suggest the state law would be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.951" offset="875186">This is something it would take into account very clearly.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="207.150" offset="931924">The closest -- the closest illustration that comes to my mind is the “Medical Question Box” illustration, in which I'm not able to say it was the only ground because I don't remember but at least one of the grounds on which a license was not renewed was that the station had engaged in this practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.618" offset="1001827">Now, the case that is close to it and which I think is the case that Justice White must have referred to yesterday when he said, “this power was challenged”, involves a little different question but I think it does -- it is certainly close to the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.946" offset="1059192">There is a station, I believe, the Palmetto Broadcasting Company or something like that in South Carolina, whose license was not renewed for two reasons: that they were allegedly false representations made to the Commission; and second because a good part of the commentary by one of its disc jockeys was believed by the Commission to be in very bad taste if not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.492" offset="1173295">As I am informed, Justice White, there is no challenge to the power of the Commission to take these things into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.161" offset="1207986">There is in that case, a challenge that centering -- that taking it into account as bad taste because it's arguably obscene of passes over the line in the censorship and I would have to acknowledge here, do acknowledge, that the Commission's power to deal with this subject matter is of course limited by the provision in the statute that I mentioned yesterday that says, it should not engage in censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.820" offset="1322611">But within the two banks of that canal, it has unquestionably exercised its powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="729.962" offset="3023182">The Court has held -- the Court has held that New Mexico has the power to make that finding in the Williamson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.069" offset="3059649">And I would point out here though that so far as New Mexico's power to deal with New Mexican optometrists and opticians, there is no question about its power to deal with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.118" offset="3123806">Furthermore, I would think that as I suggested yesterday that a distinction at least might be drawn depending on whether this was a New Mexican optician or optometrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.125" offset="3175842">Certainly, he could be dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.954" offset="3187231">Alright now, there may well be a difference, I don't think it's the whole argument because the arguments that I hope that time to make that would bear on both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.351" offset="3232789">But I think there may well be a difference between the case where New Mexico prosecutes the radio station as in aider or abettor in what is clearly in offense within New Mexico's jurisdiction, and the case where what New Mexico is seeking to do is to take hold of this transmitter which happens to be located within its border.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.746" offset="3342399">As a way of cutting off a transaction coming in from Texas, cutting off radio broadcast going to both territories, going back to Texas in part, and bearing upon sales that are going to take in place in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.285" offset="3424528">There it is, if I might just finish the thought, there I think it is true to say that New Mexico is in the sense singling out the transmitter and trying to use it as a way of accomplishing something it couldn't otherwise come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.214" offset="3492237">And that seems to me to be focused upon a licensee under the Communications Act, in a way that makes this not quite, but something of a direct effort to regulate interstate broadcasting as such almost.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.543" offset="3565589">I do have to add the “almost” but it is very much so to my way of thinking.</text>

            <text syncTime="886.666" offset="3650017">I think to answer you, I really have to express a little bit review on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.292" offset="3668511">I find this an exceedingly close case on the commerce part.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.687" offset="3686170">I think it might well be held that on commerce grounds, this was unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.949" offset="3715218">But it seems to me that in determining whether there is preemption, it is quite proper to take into account the considerations that are also relevant on the commerce part.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.733" offset="3774255">And after all, what we're trying to do here in determining whether there is preemption is, I take it, to determine the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.228" offset="3816260">If Congress -- the appellees in amicus argue, that the question is whether there is a squared conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.090" offset="3855757">That is not the test as this Court has laid it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.098" offset="3867773">There are many cases where the Court has said that supplementary legislation by a state is improper, that legislation in an area that Congress intended to be free as improper, the duplicate legislation is improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.569" offset="3929631">The question is, did Congress when it passed this statute intend the whole area to be subjected to the exclusive jurisdiction to Communications Commission or did it intend to leave the way open for each of 50 states to pass such additional laws in the area as each or all of the 50 might see fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.794" offset="4022523">Now on the question intent, Justice Goldberg, I think that these considerations that I have mentioned -- been mentioning some of them, are highly important.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.479" offset="4069334">For example, it seems to me that it is of the utmost importance, that this is a subject in which the dominant interest are multistate because it is the more likely that Congress would not choose to delegate them to individual state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.045" offset="4155538">Again, it seems to me, it's of the utmost importance that this is something that so far as Congress limited the powers of the Commission, it did so I submit, not out of the desire to leave this to local control, but out of a recognition that we were in the area or close to the area of freedom of speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.406" offset="4248952">And I think the limit on the Commission's power, the fact that it should not get into censorship reflects as substantive policy that when one to expect to be just as applicable to the state, as to the Commission itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.963" offset="4311228">So that here, the failure to regulate programming more is to be explained not by leaving something for state law to operate in, but as an adoption of a substantive policy of not allowing any regulation in that area, and therefore as an indication of the desire to exclude this day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.685" offset="4398164">Again, I think it is relevant in determining preemptions whether this is a subject in which the State really has any vital interest or can really do very much about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.157" offset="4448005">I pointed out here that there is a way for the state to deal with its vital interest so far the optometrists or opticians are concerned, it's also true of course that it can't deal very much about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.542" offset="4493563">And whenever it does try to do anything about it, it affects the people of other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.128" offset="4515924">New Mexico can't control the broadcasting from the station in Seminole or around the Texas side of the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.502" offset="4545390">It can't keep the airwaves from reaching its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.795" offset="4558555">All it can do is put this station, adding on together the capriciously disadvantaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.611" offset="4581857">Again, if New York attempts to deal -- attempts to control of what is broadcast from a radio station in New York, it is attempting to regulate not only from what the people of Connecticut can hear, what people of New Jersey can hear, and of course, as applied to something like chain broadcasting of regulation from the different state, would create an altogether impossible situation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Archibald Cox</label>
            <text syncTime="1170.007" offset="4783417">Well, first, I would say that although 31 have, it's equally true that -- I have not -- equally, I would distinguish, Justice Goldberg, it very sharply between the problem of fraud as the problem of the advertising on price, and this brings me to a question which is very important here and I would hope I might take an extra minute Mr. Chief Justice to discuss it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.153" offset="4900028">Now, clearly this is a matter of drawing a line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.579" offset="4917687">It's quite plain that a state may apply some state laws, not only to broadcasting stations, which is obvious, but to broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.284" offset="4964498">For example, we would fully agree that New Mexico or any other state may apply its laws of defamation to a radio station.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.657" offset="5017997">That if a radio station knowingly permits its facilities be used to broadcast the signals to a gang of professional thieves or gamblers in some way, that the ordinary criminal law may be applied to the broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.286" offset="5080482">On the other hand, it seems to us entirely clear that an intolerable situation would be created if each of the 50 states could regulate the content of advertising, the time that the station might give to advertising, the amount of it which might be -- have to be in local origin as applied to national origin, where is the line to be drawn in between?</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.401" offset="5181001">I would say there were four standards, four criteria that are applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.106" offset="5215796">The first would seem to me is this a state law which singles out radio broadcasting in some way or is it in part of the massive general laws applicable to everybody and the fact that it is done over the radio makes no difference in a case of defamation if it's done in conversation that's defamatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.771" offset="5318405">Selling -- obtaining property under false pretense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.224" offset="5332302">It doesn't matter whether you do it on the radio or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.968" offset="5347244">This case, it seems to us to come according to these criteria, pretty far into the area of regulating radio broadcast as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.078" offset="5391653">First, it deals only with mass communications which does not exclude the newspapers or billboards, but nevertheless, narrows the area, to an area close bound radio broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.313" offset="5452675">And in second place, I suggested a moment ago, this is an effort to use the physical location of the transmitter, the broadcast as a handle for doing something that New Mexico couldn't otherwise do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.116" offset="5515786">The second line of inquiry that we think is relevant is whether the state law falls in the area of general common law torts or crimes whether they've been incorporated in statute or into the more modern type of social and economic legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.701" offset="5598124">I think there are two reasons why this is a material inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.530" offset="5617455">The first is that of course, any statute in Anglo-American law is put down into an existing body of law and it takes a very strong showing to demonstrate the point that Congress intended to oust.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.100" offset="5683806">But the second reason is that whether you're dealing with crimes that are malum in se as distinguished from malum prohibitum to suggest, rather to draw a sharp distinction, or where you're dealing with the common law torts, you're dealing with an area in which there are divergences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.128" offset="5755904">But on the whole, the law of the 50 states is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.951" offset="5771160">On the other hand, when you get into the more modern type of social and economic written legislation, the opportunities for divergence are a great deal (Inaudible) and more conflicts in uniformity, and more conflicts in diversity are about to grow out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.396" offset="5849004">Third, we think it's important whether the measure is a prior restraint or attempts to deal with the matter after the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.171" offset="5884008">But here, quite clearly, we're dealing with an adjunction in the area of prior restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.342" offset="5904697">And fourth, Mr. Justice Black and Mr. Justice Goldberg, it does seem to me that the degree of the State's interest is a material factor in determining whether you have preemption because you have to consider how much the State is being hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.466" offset="5977213">And I would with reference to that point simply refer back to what I said before without denying that New Mexico has interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.991" offset="6015352">It is an interest where the nature of the technical problems limits what it could do and where it can deal with the problem so far as truly domestic to New Mexico without the necessity of taking hold the radio broadcast or broadcasters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2751.603" offset="11109752">In the first place, Pennsylvania had pure and simply set out on a program of censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.594" offset="11141726">It required submission of films to be used in televising to a Board of Censors prior to showing them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.109" offset="11183835">The Pennsylvania Act was thus directed at broadcasting as such.</text>

            <text syncTime="2778.063" offset="11215600">It seems to us that the Government's argument presupposes here in this case that New Mexico has set about upon a scheme of regulating the radio industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.934" offset="11279130">We have set upon a scheme of public health regulation in particular, the human eyesight, which this Court sustained in Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.493" offset="11329390">The federal statutes involved in the Dumont decision where those treating of license suspension for indecent or false transmission, and the criminal sanctions for doing the same thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3272.311" offset="13192652">Yet, it was stated that there was nothing in the Federal Communications Act dislodging the power of the States to deal with fraud simply because a licensed broadcaster was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.417" offset="13253047">Now, we submit that by the same token, there is nothing in the Federal Communications Act dislodging the power of the States to deal with the health question of this import.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.946" offset="13307173">In Johnson, it was held that the public interest which the Commission must protect is involved in granting licenses which can hardly imply that state laws are nullified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.747" offset="13374360">Now, we submit that state laws on health by the same line of reason have not been nullified simply because licensed facilities are being used as instruments for thwarting a legitimate public health policy of the State or is it amiss to consider the impact of the state action, first and foremost, is that in Johnson termination of the station was possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.854" offset="13514794">There is nothing like that present in the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.335" offset="13528691">It becomes important from a practical standpoint, and that the appellant Permian does not even show anywhere in the record in this cause that the prohibition of running these ads entails a loss of revenue to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.825" offset="13606640">Now, it is also the impact of the state action affirm the federal agencies' regulatory tasks, that must be considered in determining the issue of preemption, not whether as the Government says.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.854" offset="13678738">The state action involves a traditional or well-known, or common law remedy or whether the state action involves modern day concepts of health or welfare or social legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.764" offset="13750418">Now, the appellants and the United States failed utterly to show how the decree would interfere with Federal Communications Commission duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.728" offset="13802245">The obedience of this decree by the appellant Permian will not entail disobedience by Permian of any rule or regulation of the Commission or of any statute of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.534" offset="13873507">And furthermore, the United States fails to cite authority for its assertive distinction between traditional common law remedies on the one hand which they state -- which they say the State may impose, and the enforcement of public remedies under health legislation on the other hand, which the Government says, the State may not impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.126" offset="13987924">Regents versus Carroll decided by this Court, is a great interest, for there, there was a clutch between the state action and the federal action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.883" offset="14038915">In that case, there was a stock purchase contract involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.663" offset="14062007">The Federal Communications Commission required repudiation by the broadcaster of that stock purchase contract prior to a renewal of the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.650" offset="14113938">On the other hand, the Georgia courts enforced the contract and awarded monetary damages in the amount of a $145,000.00 which state action this Court upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.419" offset="14177050">Now, the language of the opinion is interesting, and that this Court said that it realized that it was upholding a state judgment which in effect nullified a Communications Commission order, stating that what it was doing was out of proper regard for both the federal and state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.604" offset="14285824">Now, the state interest there of course were -- was to uphold the sanctity of contracts entered into in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.418" offset="14325008">Here, the state action is far more significant, we think, far more important by virtue of the fact that human eyesight, a legitimate health measure is involved nor is there any risk in the present case that an affirmance of the Supreme Court of New Mexico would in effect nullify a Commission order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.434" offset="14429080">There is -- there is no risk of that here as certainly there was in the Carroll case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.764" offset="14470457">I think it's highly important to consider the results of a holding that the field has been preempted in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.702" offset="14514134">If this Court should agree with the Government and hold that the field has been preempted, then New Mexico and 49 other States are powerless to deal with this kind of bait and switch advertising which may be run over a radio.</text>

            <text syncTime="4130.853" offset="16626813">Now, a large argument of the United States is that programs and advertising are to be considered by the Federal Communications Commission in either in application, a renewal, or a revocation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.876" offset="16710928">Now, that does not exclude state jurisdiction of the type attempted to be asserted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.377" offset="16748857">If, as the Government suggests, the Commission on a renewal proceeding would give consideration to whether or not the state law had been obeyed, it has been conceded by the Solicitor General that that is just one factor out of a great many that would be pertinent or relevant in the renewal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.845" offset="16850735">And even if the Commission were to look into the question of whether there had been obedience by the broadcaster to state law, it would of course have to refer back to the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4202.801" offset="16914578">There would be no conflict in a case like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.399" offset="16924923">There would be no preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.324" offset="16932655">Rather, there would be a reference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.951" offset="16955225">Now, it's -- it's been mentioned by the Solicitor General before the bar that even if there had been a few isolated instances of disobedience by the broadcaster which came to light in a renewal proceeding, it would nonetheless be quite doubtful if the Commissioner would refuse under those conditions to renew the license.</text>
            <text syncTime="4240.173" offset="17064103">It therefore, as a practical matter, falls back upon the States where these health measures have rested traditionally.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.277" offset="17104436">Furthermore, the Government conceives that the Communications Act does not broadly withdraw from the States the power to redress private wrongs since the Act contains no remedial provisions for private persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="4267.763" offset="17174444">But the same is equally true of public wrongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4273.490" offset="17197328">The Act contains no provisions permitting the redress of public wrongs by the States, either for violation of health measures or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.221" offset="17248214">Aside from the question of preemption in the Huron case, the ship owner therein argued that uniformity was necessary by virtue of the Commerce Clause itself even absent a preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4305.141" offset="17323969">And this Court held that what was enacted there by the City of Detroit was a legitimate health measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.435" offset="17353122">Now, here in New Mexico centers is that of eyesight.</text>
            <text syncTime="4315.881" offset="17366915">Detroit centers was in map of pure air, but the effect of Detroit's action upon interstate commerce could certainly have been more disruptive or potentially more disruptive of uniformity than the action of New Mexico in the case at bar, for the simple fact was that alterations in the ship's structures would have been necessary in order to comply with the Smoke Abatement Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="4349.142" offset="17499930">Those ships necessarily had to touch at other ports upon the Great Lakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.322" offset="17520619">Potentially, there was a disruption of uniformity because other ports could have had different requirements as to the smoke, the abatement of smoke.</text>

            <text syncTime="4396.367" offset="17688848">New Mexico's action is essentially low.</text>
            <text syncTime="4399.987" offset="17703372">It has not set out to regulate broadcasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="4403.929" offset="17719045">It has not set out to regulate newspapers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4408.684" offset="17738062">It has enacted a measure which in this -- which has this Court has held in Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="4413.845" offset="17758751">It's perfectly proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="4416.120" offset="17767842">The fact that interstate commerce is involved at all in the case at bar is purely incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="4424.658" offset="17802010">For example, in the case of Panhandle Eastern Gas Line versus Michigan Public Service Commission, there the Court said that Congress had only occupied a limited field in the entire scope of regulating the natural gas industry and the transmission of natural gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.369" offset="17880900">In other words, it had not legislated on the subject of direct sales to the ultimate consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4454.964" offset="17923218">And hence, there was left a certain amount of room for state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4461.983" offset="17951326">This Court said that there was no preemption because there were no opposing directives.</text>
            <text syncTime="4468.862" offset="17978807">Now, that may be said equally here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4471.444" offset="17989151">There is no opposing -- there is no directive in the Communications Act as to professional advertising -- true, false or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4482.094" offset="18031783">So you don't have the situation of opposing directives which the Court held in Panhandle was the test of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.017" offset="18075460">Aside from the question of preemption, the sales in Panhandle were matters of local concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="4500.531" offset="18105448">Hence, the certificate of public convenience and necessity could have -- was required by the State of Michigan of Panhandle before it could engage in the sales to the consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4513.644" offset="18157902">Now, that is severe state action which this Court upheld there for the power to require a certificate of public convenience and necessity comes awfully close to the power to prohibit activity all together by the gas company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4530.375" offset="18224880">But we find inconceivable to believe that eye care is of less concern and the States are less brave to act in that field and in public utility regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4546.479" offset="18289246">Indeed, the balancing of the interest over the State and the nation in this case gives rise to a situation where the need for the State to be free to act barely cries out for an affirmative.</text>
            <text syncTime="4563.761" offset="18358418">This is a matter that has been traditionally left to the State, public health.</text>
            <text syncTime="4569.482" offset="18381302">Congress may never act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4571.033" offset="18387466">Indeed, I think it's safe to say that Congress may never even want to act or concern itself with it, but it falls back upon the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4581.458" offset="18429158">Now, if this Court holds that preemption has occurred, then the States are powerless to prohibit this form of advertising over the radio.</text>
            <text syncTime="4595.383" offset="18484955">The appellants placed great stress upon the case of Baldwin versus Seelig in the aspects of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="4603.381" offset="18516929">We do not believe that case was in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="4606.279" offset="18528528">There, New York had said, “You can't bring this milk in into New York unless you have paid in Vermont the same price you would have had to have paid in the State of New York.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4618.463" offset="18577220">We do not say that a newspaper originating in Texas cannot come into New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="4628.865" offset="18618807">We do not say -- perhaps more apropos, we do not say that a radio station in Texas could not promulgate this form of advertising, even though subsequently heard in the State of New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.904" offset="18682964">But what we do suggest that the local regulation of this advertising is permissible to New Mexico because the cert -- the health of its citizens are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4662.113" offset="18751822">It is what New Mexico residents here in New Mexico that is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.222" offset="18792260">And certainly, local regulation of advertising, even though that advertising is interstate is on no higher plane than anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.636" offset="18833951">For example, there is the case of Railway Express Agency versus New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="4688.755" offset="18858402">There is -- you can't dismiss, as appellant seek to do the Railway Express case, simply by saying that traffic regulation was therein involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.377" offset="18900929">In fact, this whole concept of permissible local regulation of local incidents in interstate commerce, commerce, arose with the traffic case, Cooley versus Board of Port Wardens.</text>
            <text syncTime="4714.188" offset="18960175">There it was -- the States were allowed to make certain requirements of harbor patents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4720.458" offset="18985253">So the whole concept of local regulation of a certain incidence of interstate commerce arose in a traffic case, we might say.</text>

            <text syncTime="5672.049" offset="22791607">All there's attempting to do here is prevent these appellants who might compete in papers and radio broadcast stations in Texas from disseminating the same advertising which they will not attempt to prevent from coming in.</text>
            <text syncTime="5688.745" offset="22858376">Now, we submit that this discrimination certainly should not be tolerated under the prior cases of this Court that we've previously discussed.</text>

            <text syncTime="5726.100" offset="23007796">I think this was perhaps a tougher case than gambling but I'd say no.</text>
            <text syncTime="5730.656" offset="23025977">I would say no.</text>
            <text syncTime="5731.519" offset="23029426">I would say that if -- if we -- if we accept the policy that each state as to various activities such as gambling and prostitution or advertising by professionals is entitled to set its own public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5750.080" offset="23103718">And it seems to me that if Texas sets a public policy that is different, then the public policy set by New Mexico consistent with the du -- the Commerce Clause, certainly, New Mexico cannot impose its standards on Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="5770.150" offset="23183966">I would apply this to that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5772.208" offset="23192221">Although admittedly, Mr. Justice Goldberg, it's something that might not be tasteful to people in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="5782.970" offset="23235271">But the fact that it is not tasteful to people in New Mexico, it seems to me leaves them with recourse to Congress and I think perhaps under the Mann Act, there may be a proscription under this by virtue of congressional enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5799.387" offset="23300890">I don't know whether the Mann Act really applies to advertising this enactment, I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="5808.502" offset="23337357">But we submit that certainly, when you consider in this case that the optometrist is in Texas, his advertising originates with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="5821.942" offset="23391169">He performs his services in Texas that the case should not turn on the fact that in this case, the type is set in New Mexico or the radio broadcasting voice starts in New Mexico, that the advertising, in a more ultimate sense, has started in Texas and it relates to the services to be performed in Texas, and we submit that this is an interstate transaction which is entitled to protection under the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="5854.519" offset="23521468">Now, there are some points I would like to make very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="5857.948" offset="23535156">One is that both counsel for the appellee have referred to this as bait and switch advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="5866.350" offset="23568802">The record will show that the only thing these appellants carried was price advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="5874.149" offset="23599940">I don't want the Court to get the impression that this was something more odious than it was because it was simply ba -- simply price advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="5883.798" offset="23638601">Another point made by the appellee is that the Dumont case involved censorship in terms of obscenity and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5899.056" offset="23699623">Now, the statute involved in that case actually provides that the Pennsylvania Board and I'm quoting, “Shall examine or supervise the examinations of all the films, reels or views to be exhibited or used in Pennsylvania shall approve such films, reels or views which are moral and proper, and shall disapprove such as are sacrilegious, obscene, indecent, or immoral are such as tend in the judgment of board to the base of corrupt morals.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5931.916" offset="23831071">I submit that this is a far broader statute than any of provisions that might have been involved in the sections of the Federal Communications Commission Act that the Dumont opinion mentioned.</text>
