            <text syncTime="61.881" offset="352904">Shortly after 7:00 in the evening, on June 30,1960, a number of persons, Negro and White, gathered outside of the entrance to Glen Echo and formed a picket line.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.054" offset="1593616">He had orders that very day of June 30, 1960 on those particular people from the manager, “give them five minutes to get off and, if they don't get off, arrest them for trespassing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="384.669" offset="1644084">He carried on his orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.305" offset="1658608">We raised all the federal questions below and the question before the Court -- the two questions, and I'd like to make clear what I see as the two questions because they are different and they require an answer to Justice Black's question about the Civil Rights cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.356" offset="1738856">I say that Shelley and Kraemer requires a reversal and that even if it did not, as Mr. Justice Goldberg just asked me, there are additional points here above that which do require a reversal such is the fact that Collins was everything here.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.591" offset="1807820">Collins was the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.101" offset="1813776">He was the agent of the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.705" offset="1820254">He was the one who made the crime by ask -- by ordering them off.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.107" offset="1833838">He was -- here, you had a confluence of state and private power discriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.108" offset="1853900">This was perfectly clear that we have a case there whether you apply Shelley and Kraemer to the simple arrest and conviction or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.042" offset="1885560">But, we have a second point, whether in my time I will get to it, but I want to state it now before I elaborate the first because it is briefed fully and because I consider it of extreme importance, particularly as Justice Black asked me, for those who take a different view of Shelley and Kraemer, it might be important.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.403" offset="1962987">In the concurring opinion in the Garner case, Mr. Justice Douglas pointed out that a re -- large retail establishment might very well be required to serve that the licensing and regulation might very well be the equivalent of state action and that a retail establishment might very well be required to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.123" offset="2049923">The difference, therefore, between my two points, and I want to make it very clear that this is the real difference, is that under the first point, they can sit on the carousel, but under the second point, the carousel has to move.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.494" offset="2099346">In other words, under the first point, you have a right to sit at the hamburger stand and you can't be removed by the police for sitting there in exercising your -- and standing there and seeking service.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.545" offset="2147621">Under the second point, which does require the overruling of the Civil Rights cases, the second point, the hamburger must be served.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.010" offset="2181475">Now, the case does not involve the second point at this stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.051" offset="2197671">For those who will agree on the first point, there is -- under the constitutional doctrine of limit -- taking the most limited ground, one would not get to the second point, but for those to whom the first point would seem -- on which I couldn't get an agreement on the first point, then it seems to me that we have squarely raised and we do ask a reconsideration of the Civil Rights cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.784" offset="2296519">Now, addressing myself to the first point, and I'm addressing myself, if I may, to Mr. Justice Harlan and Mr. Justice Stewart's question of New York or Montana and here we have actually a little mix here.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.806" offset="2348659">We have Maryland, which is a border state, but I'm perfectly happy to treat this case as though it had happened in Montana or New York in answer to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.352" offset="2394843">I believe that the mere arrest and trial and conviction of a Negro American for trespass when he is excluded for the sole reason that he is a Negro is a violation to the Equal Protection Clause and is a clearer case than Shelley and Kraemer.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.994" offset="2481361">I think if this Court had had the two cases side by side in 1948 and if it only had this -- and had made a rule it would only decide one of them in favor of equal protection, we would have won that competition, and I think that for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.033" offset="2549593">Mr. Greenberg made the first one very eloquently this morning, earlier, when he said that, in Shelley and Kraemer, they just held the courts open.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.750" offset="2588463">All that happened in Shelley and Kraemer was the state opened its courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.254" offset="2602465">Here, the state pulled a man by the scruff of the neck and took him into Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.842" offset="2620750">Certainly that's more state action than simply leaving your courts open.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.834" offset="2636737">Secondly, this is criminal action and certainly, a -- without -- certainly a stronger action than civil action and, thirdly, I think this is critical, maybe the man in Shelley and Kraemer did have some right -- did have some right of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.245" offset="2714373">The man in Shelley and Kraemer whose property right was really circumscribed by this Court was a man who had made an arrangement under which he thought Negros could not move next door.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.033" offset="2777590">There's a lot more privacy, Your Honors, in who can be your neighbor than in who you serve at an amusement park with thousands of people coming in there every day.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.881" offset="2832969">Now, I'm not suggesting, I don't think Shelley and Kraemer is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.639" offset="2848016">I think it was eminently correct, but I am suggesting that this case is a far simpler case and I'm just limiting it now to arrest and conviction, that this is a far simpler case than Shelley against Kraemer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1210.696" offset="4948156">He was perfectly clearly an agent for the owners and he was perfectly clearly an agent of the state as the police.</text>

            <text syncTime="1309.166" offset="5342083">In other words, he was there on the spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.541" offset="5355562">He was the agent to make the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="1319.823" offset="5384714">So, first place, it's earlier in relationship and, second place, he had no discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.562" offset="5411673">Suppose the policeman had come on, a very nice policeman that was trying to do his job, sees five young Negro students on a merry-go-round.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.309" offset="5450648">Now, the first thing a policeman who isn't an agent is going to say to himself “well, my goodness! How can you arrest five nice-looking young students for wanting to ride on a horse on a merry-go-round?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.015" offset="5501430">And, he'd say “well, the first thing I'm going to try to do is see if I can settle this.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1434.455" offset="5843216">Now, just in conclusion of point one, I'd like to just make a reference to the difference bet -- in the government's position and our own in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.474" offset="5883340">The government relies entirely on what I have just referred to what Mr. Justice Goldberg referred to as the additional points, Collins, his badge, putting together private.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.398" offset="5930987">I say that there are two grounds here, both in the Shelley and Kraemer grounds and that the government only makes the second of the grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.925" offset="5969126">The government apparently feels that the second ground is conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.239" offset="5986367">It does seem to me that the first ground here is equally strong, but that, together, they leave no question as to the outcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.504" offset="6027431">It is, therefore, with a certain amount of humility that I would argue the second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.548" offset="6051568">However, it does become relevant, as Justice Black indicated, for those who might not accept the first argument, we take the position in point two of our brief that Glen Echo didn't have any right to discriminate, that the use of the words “lawful right to discriminate” or “lawful right --” I think that we u -- the use of the words below were “lawful policy of segregation” is a misnomer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.459" offset="6183225">We accept the statement by Mr. Justice Douglas in Garner that those who run a retail establishment under permit from a municipality operate, in my view, a public facility in which there can be no more discrimination based on race than is constitutionally permitted in the more customary type of public facility.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.732" offset="6356365">The fact is the Fourteenth Amendment, as this Court has said and said, was primarily designed for the benefit of the colored race and it seems to me that what we are saying here is that we -- that rules that will be set up on Equal Protection Clause which is absolute do not necessarily determine how the due process clause would apply in the future to the same institution, and I'm referring here to Glen Echo.</text>

            <text syncTime="2043.630" offset="8279918">Now, the fact that there was no governmental restraint involved here or governmental action that would induce them to have such an exclusionary policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.784" offset="8320564">I think it's evidenced by the fact that and is conceded by my brother that shortly after the conclusion of these cases in the lower Court, the park abandoned its policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.241" offset="8358390">So that, the park now is fully integrated and, shortly after that, on the other side of the coin, Montgomery County enacted an Equal Accommodations Bill, effective January of 1962, but I think the element of state action, the state policy, state law is apparently absent in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3982.900" offset="16037031">The suggestion is that, in Shelley and Kraemer, there was a willing buyer and a willing seller.</text>

            <text syncTime="3992.415" offset="16075065">That is a difference and I respectfully suggest it is a most meaningless difference because in Shelley against Kraemer, there was a property right, just as there is here.</text>

            <text syncTime="4013.353" offset="16158866">There was a covenant in Shelley and Kraemer where a man said to another man “we agree that no Negro will go on your property because I don't want a Negro next to me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.996" offset="16205364">The second man violated his contract and sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="4028.262" offset="16218425">This Court held that, although that was a property right and this Court wasn't saying it was illegal to try and have that covenant, you would neither allow an injunction against that or damages for the breach of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.066" offset="16281642">That's exactly what we have here, under this half of the case, that this man here, this owner of Glen Echo, had a right to say no Negros but he didn't have a right to get the state to enforce it for him anymore than the covenanter had a right not to have a Negro neighbor, had a right to have the state enforce that for him.</text>
