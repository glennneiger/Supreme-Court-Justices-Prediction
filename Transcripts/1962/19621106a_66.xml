            <label>Ms. Constance Baker Motley</label>
            <text syncTime="39.192" offset="260159">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.446" offset="277191">The petitioners in this case are 10 Negro students attending Daniel Payne College in Birmingham, Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.019" offset="311463">They are here pursuant to Title 28, United States Code Section 1257, seeking a reversal of their convictions for trespass after warning by the Alabama Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.876" offset="366843">Now, relying on the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, these petitioners repeatedly find the law and assert here that their convictions are constitutionally void because they are the product of state action manifestly prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.400" offset="476975">Now all 10 petitioners were arrested on March 31st, 1960 following sit-in demonstrations in five Birmingham department stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.859" offset="530787">They at that time were seeking food service at a lunch counter limited to white persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.125" offset="563911">Each petitioner was charged and convicted of violating Section 1436 of the Birmingham Code, a trespass after warning statute which appears on page 2 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.724" offset="614275">There are five trials in these cases, one, petitioner was tried and then it was stipulated that the testimony as to that one petitioner would apply to his companion.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.282" offset="664534">You see, two petitioners went into each of these five stores.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.435" offset="689089">And they were first tried in the Recorder's Court of the City of Birmingham and convicted and then appealed to the Circuit Court, their convictions were -- they affirmed and affirmed by the Court of Appeals of Alabama which is the only court that wrote an opinion and certiorari in the Supreme Court of the State was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.961" offset="763173">Now the significant facts in all of these cases are relatively the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.719" offset="790235">The first important fact is that Birmingham has a city ordinance which makes it unlawful to serve Negroes and whites in the same room.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.215" offset="828270">That ordinance appears on page 2 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.439" offset="845093">Now this ordinance is a part of a massive state policy of racial segregation, is set forth in our brief the Alabama segregation statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.378" offset="892844">All of the petitioners of course are Negroes.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.005" offset="907368">For one successfully sought service in department stores where Negroes are welcomed and served at all counters except the lunch counter where this ordinance requires that there be racial segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.540" offset="973511">Now, in every one of these cases, the petitioners were asked to leave the counter by some representative of the store in the sense that they were told that they could not be served there or we have a counter for Negroes on the fourth floor, in the basement once you go there.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.273" offset="1048430">Or in some instances, the counter was closed after the Negroes appeared and were told this and didn't leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.225" offset="1076224">Now, the police arrived and the police arrived in some instances when the people were still eating and the police arrived and not pursuant to a call from any member of the store in any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.171" offset="1136097">And this -- that the record is absolutely clear on that that no employee in any one of the five stores called the police.</text>

            <text syncTime="1136.076" offset="4647685">You'll notice Mr. Hall and the judge have been discussing this matter from page 24 through 26.</text>

            <text syncTime="1149.340" offset="4700766">It was simply going along with the thing and overruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.689" offset="4714141">When he says overrule, I think he means the “overrule” is a general approach to this thing that you're getting into the surrounding or -- irrelevant matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.654" offset="4749981">But another thing that I want to mention before I go into what I had in mind, addressing the Court on is the propositions that counsel has said apparently they were willing to tolerate this condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.837" offset="4806719">And I believe in briefs, they mentioned the proposition of economic give and take.</text>
