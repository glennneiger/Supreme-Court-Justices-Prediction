            <text syncTime="18.306" offset="176567">The King-Thompson Act bluntly identifies its point of conflict with the National Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.148" offset="207914">It states in so many words that it shall be unlawful after a takeover of a utility to strike as a means of enforcing demands against the utility or against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.298" offset="264547">It prohibits a strike to enforce bargaining demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.787" offset="282520">What this Court said 12 years ago in the Amalgamated Association case applies with precise equality to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.431" offset="317106">It would be sufficient to state that the Wisconsin Act in forbidding peaceful strikes for higher wages in industries covered by the Federal Act has forbidden the exercise of rights protected by Section 7 of the Federal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.717" offset="386278">Missouri says, well, no we are treating with an emergency and that makes a difference, but the same emergency with which Missouri treats is the situation which this Court said, Wisconsin could not treat with.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.543" offset="449494">In the Wisconsin case we had a transit strike as we had here.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.190" offset="468093">We had an interruption of surface transportation in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as we had an interruption of surface transportation in Kansas City, Missouri.</text>

            <text syncTime="175.132" offset="803924">My -- the implications of my first part of my statement is if precisely if Missouri wants to own and operate the transit system in Kansas City or if the city wants to own and operate it, just as New York City owns and operates the subway systems then that the situation is outside of the scope of the Federal Act and the State can then do as it chooses within constitutional limits with respect to a strike in that system.</text>

            <text syncTime="282.412" offset="1233063">I mean that the State owns, operates, and will continue so far as one can tell permanently to own and operate the facility.</text>

            <text syncTime="296.125" offset="1287920">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.745" offset="1310386">Now, in the Amalgamated Association case there were two cases decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.897" offset="1330970">The second of the two cases was one in which Wisconsin sought to prohibit a strike interrupting gas service.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.432" offset="1361063">Wisconsin was told it had no power to prohibit a strike interrupting gas service.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.771" offset="1382484">Now, if we are to indulge in comparisons of so called emergencies, I would suppose that a strike which interrupts gas service would be more critical to a community than a transit strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.617" offset="1429817">Yet, Wisconsin was told it could not prohibit a gas strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.663" offset="1446013">I cannot see therefore how Missouri can prohibit a transit strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.964" offset="1467225">Now the Missouri's argument seems to me to be based upon reading one part of this Court's decision and refusing to read another part of this Court's decision in Amalgamated Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.065" offset="1519679">When Wisconsin was arguing for the right to regulate public utility strikes it said these are local emergencies which should remain within the police power of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.970" offset="1571297">To that argument the Court said two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.890" offset="1582895">One, your statute is not emergency legislation and two, it would make no difference even if it were.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.128" offset="1619884">The state concentrates on the first alternative and refuses to look at what this Court said by way of the alternative ground for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.429" offset="1657083">Specifically what this Court said alternatively was in any event, congressional imposition of certain restrictions on petitioner's right to strike far from supporting the Wisconsin Act shows that Congress has closed the State regulation, the field of peaceful strikes in industries affecting commerce and where as here the state seeks to deny entirely a federally guaranteed right which Congress itself restricted only to a limited extent in case of national emergencies, however serious, it is manifest that the state legislation is in conflict with federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.953" offset="1823222">So it seems to us that this Court said, albeit alternatively that you cannot enter this field by labeling your situation an emergency and it is old law that where you have alternative grounds for decision neither is obiter, both are authoritative adjudications.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.894" offset="1898977">And, I think the untenability of trying to predicate state power on emergency is emphasized by the undisputed fact shown in this case that the principal component of this so called emergency was that a strike would curtail retail sales in downtown Kansas City.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.012" offset="1971388">Once you start on this emergency trail there is no place you stop.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.555" offset="2001586">The state says well we are different from the Wisconsin Statute because we do not provide for compulsory arbitration, that is a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.908" offset="2042964">It is a difference which it seems to us and makes the Wisconsin statute worse, not better from a conflict point of view, because the premise of the National Act is that in order for a union and an employer to bargain as equals the union must have a right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.977" offset="2115271">If it does not have a right to strike bargaining is just talk, there is no means by which it can move the employer to change his position.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.547" offset="2153514">Wisconsin took away the right to strike, but at least it offered a substitute in place of a compulsory arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.294" offset="2188518">Missouri takes away the right to strike and offers nothing in it's place.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.060" offset="2207640">It seems to us that it is a worst conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.723" offset="2218297">It does not ameliorate the situation to take away what the Federal Act has granted and to substitute nothing in its place.</text>

            <text syncTime="588.228" offset="2456325">But yes, discussions can go on and have in fact gone on in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.188" offset="2480149">Now the state says, well it makes a difference that we seized, that we are only prohibiting the strike during the period of seizure and this differentiates it from the federal -- from the Missouri -- from the Wisconsin situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.756" offset="2542425">Well just like compulsory arbitration Congress canvassed seizure as a method of regulating labor disputes and just like compulsory arbitration, it rejected seizure as a way of solving labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.025" offset="2599476">Now I cannot put that more succinctly than it was put by this Court in Mr. Justice Black's opinion in the Steel Seizure case, when this Court held that the President could not seize the steel mills to avert a national emergency and predicated that judgment primarily on the fact that in the Taft-Hartley Act, Congress had withheld the power to seize in order to provide a means of getting over a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.604" offset="2725804">Now specifically what was said in that opinion is this, “The use of a seizure technique to solve labor disputes in order to prevent work stoppages was not only unauthorized by any congressional enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.259" offset="2792364">Prior to this controversy, Congress had refused to adopt that method of settling labor disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.976" offset="2823293">When the Taft-Hartley Act was under consideration in 1947, Congress rejected an amendment which would have authorized such governmental seizures in cases of emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.444" offset="2869164">Apparently it was thought that the technique of seizure like that of compulsory arbitration would interfere with the process of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.935" offset="2911065">Consequently the plan Congress adopted in that Act did not provide for seizure under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.898" offset="2938964">The power to seize which Congress withheld from the President to avert a national emergency, it did not grant to a State Governor to avert a local emergency.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.555" offset="2989641">Seizure, compulsory arbitration, any other shortcut to industrial peace was blocked by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.197" offset="3020152">Congress said we put our faith in collective bargaining backed by the right to strike.”</text>
            <text syncTime="736.639" offset="3049932">This Court, 12 years ago said, “the creation of a special classification for public utilities is for Congress, not for this Court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="747.673" offset="3094026">It in effect invited the people who thought that there should be state regulation or prohibition of public utility strikes to go to Congress and people have been going to Congress ever since.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.287" offset="3144495">Bills have been introduced in 1951, 1954, 1958, 1959 and then the present session of Congress 1963, to authorize the states to regulate or prohibit public utility strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.393" offset="3204995">In 1954, in 1958 and 1959 those bills came on for a vote on the Senate floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.279" offset="3236446">In each of those years those bills were roundly defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.668" offset="3254000">Congress has refused to authorize state intercession in this field, notwithstanding this Court's indication to go to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.792" offset="3286497">It seems to us that if it's a good idea to have state regulation of public utility strikes, the place to make the argument and to sell that idea is across the mall, not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.891" offset="3342921">I don't think there is any serious question of mootness in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.102" offset="3359744">This utility has been seized three times.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.009" offset="3379388">Each time that it has threatened to strike it has been seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.614" offset="3401853">This underlying labor dispute is still unresolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.106" offset="3419826">Should this union go out on strike?</text>
            <text syncTime="832.139" offset="3431946">Every factory which impels seizure the three previous times would still operate to impel seizure a fourth time.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.190" offset="3464129">It seems to us that what we have here is a recurring threat of prohibition of the strike through seizure anytime this union will go out on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.605" offset="3509791">When you have this kind of a recurring threat, I do not see how you can have a mootness, a stilling, a non-live controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.151" offset="3547930">Furthermore, because of the very fact that these orders are temporary, temporary in the sense that a labor dispute does not go on forever and therefore seizure does not go on forever, and by the nature of a kind of dispute you have, you can never get to this Court in time to test the validity of the seizure if it's mere lifting will be sufficient to moot the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.646" offset="3661928">In this case we thought we would finally make it, because the men were saying they were not going to settle till they had a determination of their right to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.510" offset="3705396">We held out, that did us not a one wit of good, the Governor then vacated seizure, if this controversy can be mooted by vacation of seizure it means one can never get to this Court to test the validity of the King-Thompson Act so long as you are willing to comply with the injunction while it is in force.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.899" offset="3790973">You have to risk violating the injunction, getting thrown in jail for criminal contempt, and that is the only road by which you will get to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.920" offset="3827022">Now, it seems to us that with a history of recurrent seizures, with the short-term orders which are necessarily involved with a combination of recurrence and a short-term order is the classic situation for saying that a controversy is not mooted.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.151" offset="3899956">I think the other cases in which this Court has held that the controversy was mooted by virtue of the lifting of the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.718" offset="3930258">In the two other cases, there was an actual settlement of a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.961" offset="3947186">Here we do not have a settlement of the labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.861" offset="3958784">Here we have a real risk that if the union were to go out on strike tomorrow in this labor dispute, you would have seizure tomorrow unless the Governor chose not to because of the existence of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.243" offset="4020328">Now the other thing, it seems to me with respect to the other two cases, as I think it was possible to say on the records in those cases that we could awake a recurrence, we did not have to anticipate seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.023" offset="4075499">Now, we did not have to anticipate that there will be a recurrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.712" offset="4090232">I think that basis for decision is no longer entertainable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.422" offset="4105070">I think this record shows that unless this case remains alive notwithstanding the lifting of seizure there is no way you can reach this Court to test the validity of the King-Thomson Act, and I think this Court's decisions both in the recurrent, in the situations of threatened recurrence and in the short-term order doctrine have posed the possibility to a wrongdoer being able to continue doing what he wants to do and at the point where you can finally decide whether what he is doing is valid or invalid, he pulls the case out under you by stopping what is the challenge act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1053.079" offset="4315721">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.763" offset="4334425">Addressing myself first to the mootness issue, it is the position of the State of Missouri that this case is in fact as moot as was Local No. 86, which this Court decided several years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.119" offset="4395865">It was moot because there was no subject matter then in existence upon which the judgment of this Court could operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.274" offset="4436511">What the appellant's overlook is the nature of this case and the nature of the relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.789" offset="4486562">In this case, the parties were the State of Missouri as the plaintiff, the union and the various officials and members as the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.632" offset="4525850">The state sought an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.719" offset="4534209">The state obtained an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.472" offset="4545285">There was no declaratory relief sought or granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.238" offset="4564302">The union then appealed, seeking relief from the restraint imposed by that injunction that is all they could seek on appeal by the action of the governor and releasing the property to the company not in order to avoid mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.321" offset="4644655">That I think is a reflection upon the Governor of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.248" offset="4660328">He did so because it was the mandatory duty of the Governor under the opinion of the Missouri Supreme Court in this very case to release the property just as soon as in his judgment, based on his investigation of the facts then existing, some 14 months later in the initial seizure, that there was no dire, immediate, imminent threat of jeopardy or disaster to the citizens of the state or the Community of Kansas City.</text>
