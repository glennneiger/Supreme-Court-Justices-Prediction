            <label>Mr. David Axelrod</label>
            <text syncTime="43.244" offset="276355">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.110" offset="287848">I represent the twin Truck Line appellants in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.307" offset="304567">Mr. Weinberg represents the union appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.716" offset="318255">This is an appeal from the judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois which dismissed a complaint to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission which granted a certificate authorizing the performance of permanent motor carrier operations in interstate commerce by the appellee, Nebraska Short Line Carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.672" offset="410102">The appellant truck lines are certificated interstate carriers authorized to serve Omaha, Nebraska on the one hand, Chicago, Kansas City, and Saint Louis on the other, the points between which the Commission granted the certificate to the Nebraska Short Line Carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.475" offset="489305">The Nebraska Short Line Carriers which was the applicant before the Interstate Commerce Commission for the certificate is a Nebraska corporation organized and owned by 12 motor carriers, nine union carriers, operating wholly within the State of Nebraska in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.839" offset="562761">These carriers use the point of Omaha, Nebraska as an interchanged point for the purpose of interchanging traffic with the appellant truck lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.724" offset="606229">About 1954, the union undertook to organize the employees of the nonunion carriers in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.818" offset="642696">Their organizational activities were unsuccessful and the result was that the labor pressure was brought to bear which had the effect of restricting the activities of the appellant, certificated truck lines, who had been interchanging traffic at Omaha with the nonunion carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.705" offset="722213">This pressure came about as a result of the fact, that the appellant, certificated lines, have "hot cargo" clauses, which was customary at the time with the union under which it was provided that a carrier wouldn't discharge or discipline any employee who refused to cross a picket line or refused to handle freight tendered by anyone who was engaged in a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.794" offset="822523">As a result of the union invoking its labor pressures, about May 1956, the local nonunion Nebraska carriers experienced certain interchange difficulties with some, but not all of the other carriers with whom they had been interchanging at Omaha, Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.610" offset="901831">The result of which was the filing by this cooperative Nebraska Short Line Carriers Inc. of two applications before the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.100" offset="939760">Both of these were designed to substitute for the appellant truck lines and to provide an outlet for them in connection with the movement of their freight, moving to and from points in Nebraska.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.628" offset="993886">In addition to the two permanent applications, the Nebraska Short Lines also filed, at the height of the problem, a temporary authority application.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.285" offset="1036518">This temporary authority application was granted by the Commission in the year January, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.171" offset="1072044">The difficulties had been encountered immediately prior to 1957 and for a period of time which could establish a date of approximately the latter part of 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.721" offset="1122304">Nebraska Short Lines, though it was granted its temporary authority in January of 1957, did not commence its operations until March of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.828" offset="1170683">And so here at the very beginning and at the outset of the problem, Nebraska Short Lines, the fighting ship of the 12 nonunion carriers who had organized it, did not set sail until several months after it had obtained its right to start a service from the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.348" offset="1252812">Both examiners who heard the two applications for permanent authority recommended denials of both applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.314" offset="1284577">Both examiners found that there was no need for the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.630" offset="1301922">Examiner Sutherland in the first instance found that two carriers, two of the appellants, Burlington and Santa Fe Trail, have always continued to interchange with the Nebraska carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.446" offset="1353122">Examiner Driscoll in the second case found that after a period of time and approximately at the time of the second hearing which was in April of 1957, that in addition to Burlington and Santa Fe Trail, three other carriers began to resume the interchange of their traffic, namely, Watson, (Inaudible), and Independent Truckers.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.477" offset="1445282">The findings of facts of both examiners were confirmed by the Commission, adopted by the Commission, and beyond that, the findings of facts of both examiners were also acknowledged by the District Court which for the case subsequently.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.842" offset="1514768">Important as I see it are some specific findings of fact of the two examiners.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.422" offset="1537024">May I direct your attention please to the record at page 54 at which Examiner Sutherland, the first examiner indicated, “The evidence shows that Burlington has continued to interchange with applicant stockholders at Omaha and Lincoln on interstate traffic originated at or delivered to various points in Nebraska.”</text>
            <text syncTime="379.725" offset="1622288">Again at page 55, referring to Santa Fe Trail, the finding specifically is, in 1955 and 1956 at Omaha, Santa Fe Trail interchanged interstate traffic moving to and from Nebraska points with Abler, Wilbur, Clark, Peters, Lyon, McCay, Pony, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.983" offset="1699297">In most instances Santa Fe Trail delivered considerably more traffic to these carriers than it received.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.512" offset="1725419">These are the carriers who represented the Nebraska Short Line Cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.363" offset="1748825">I want to direct your attention if I may please further to a very specific finding of the second examiner who heard the second application and who denied it, and I refer if I may please to page 87 of the record which indicates a finding by Examiner Driscoll at page 87 of the record at finding Number 23 of Examiner Driscoll, there's this to be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.295" offset="1848508">When the evidence of these 12-carrier representatives is carefully and fairly examined, it must be said that not one of them complained of interchange conditions or of connecting line services in existence prior to the rise of union pressure in early 1956.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.027" offset="1919457">In other words, not one of them showed or even alleged that when conditions were normal, they then had a need for a new or additional connecting line at Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.419" offset="1957073">All their complaints are in fact bottomed on the rise of union pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.574" offset="1977657">I'd like to direct the Court's attention please if I may to a further specific finding by the same examiner.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.474" offset="2001272">At page 95 of the record, where the examiner first in connection with finding Number 32 details very specifically the evidence submitted in opposition to the application in which about 29 motor carriers submitted evidence on opposition to the application, and the indication by the examiner that all of them declared that except for conditions not due to their own initiative or desire, they have been ready, able, and willing to provide service for all traffic offered by shippers or connecting carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.260" offset="2144423">And lastly, to the finding of Examiner Driscoll at page 95, in finding Number 34, which is the next to the last sentence of his finding which keys the issue in this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.304" offset="2204609">Were it not for the effects of union pressure upon these carriers, there would have been no material problem to complain of, and there would be no problem here to consider, no matter how this problem is viewed, it has but one origin, labor pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.374" offset="2272841">If the labor effects were removed from this problem, no problem of any appreciable substance would remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.875" offset="2298859">In that situation, the question is, whether a grant of authority should be made, to meet, and overcome the effects of labor difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.642" offset="2341909">As we see it, this is the issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.995" offset="2355388">And the question that we present to the Court is whether a temporary service interruption which involves the interchange of freight between nonunion carriers and some, but not all, union carriers which arises out of a labor dispute, may consistently with the standards set forth in the Interstate Commerce Act, and the National Transportation Policy, we made the basis for the grant of a certificate of public convenience and necessity.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Axelrod</label>
            <text syncTime="611.250" offset="2548381">My understanding is that they have been renewed and that they are in effect today slightly changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.156" offset="2571995">But in essence, the same, and that all of the carriers in fact today, this is not a part of the record however, are operating under what may still be termed a "hot cargo" clause contract.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_j_goldberg" startTime="628.024" stopTime="631.529">
            <label>Justice Arthur J. Goldberg</label>
            <text syncTime="628.024" offset="2615463">Renewed their contract provisions as they have agreed upon with the union?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_axelrod" startTime="631.529" stopTime="896.114">
            <label>Mr. David Axelrod</label>
            <text syncTime="631.529" offset="2629465">Yes, sir, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.199" offset="2640123">As a corollary to the question that we present to the Court, we also argue -- in our brief and we point out to the Court today that one of the questions supplemental to the basic question is whether or not the Commission in this proceeding erroneously used the grant of a certificate, a permanent certificate, where the appropriate remedy, if any, was a complaint proceeding under Section 204 (c) and 212 of the Act to compel these particular carriers, to comply with their obligations under certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.180" offset="2788080">We also urge in the brief filed with this Court that the Commission's findings, that the Commission's conclusion is diametrically opposed to its own findings of fact, in turn, the findings of fact of the examiners, Judge Mercer in his dissenting opinion which is part of the record where specifically meets that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.599" offset="2877733">We take the position in this proceeding that in granting the certificate, the Commission erred and that it exceeded its jurisdiction in utilizing the certificate section, in fact, as a penalty and having exceeded its jurisdiction, it has lost its role as an expert.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.122" offset="2951816">The Commission in granting the certificate in which it failed to agree with its examiners, indicates to this Court in a very self-serving and albeit biased declaration that it was not attempting to adjudicate a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.809" offset="3022660">It took the position that it was vitally concerned not with the labor problem but with the relationship of the carriers in respect to their obligations to serve the public and notwithstanding the fact that there were some carriers who had continued uninterruptedly to serve the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.375" offset="3092877">The Commission took the position that the responsibility for the service deficiencies which existed at the time would be laid or should be laid at the hands of the unionized carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.350" offset="3140733">It's interesting that the appellee, Nebraska Short Lines Inc. came to the Commission and made the specific statement that it would never, under any circumstance, sign a "hot cargo" clause contract and even indicated to the Commission that it wouldn't want a certificate based upon its having to sign a "hot cargo" clause contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.161" offset="3227982">As a matter of fact, before the District Court counsel for Nebraska Short Line Carriers emphasized to the Court that he would even be willing to have its certificate granted by the Commission to it, limited and conditioned upon it being and remaining a nonunion carrier and it has so indicated before the Commission and to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.604" offset="3317739">In this proceeding, we take the position that the problem involved was a temporary service interruption, that it terminated on the basis of the examiner's findings in approximately April of 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.074" offset="3375626">And that even before its termination, there were carriers available with which to conduct the interchange of service at Omaha.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.042" offset="3403525">And that the grant by the Commission of a permanent authority under these circumstances was illegal and beyond the intention and purpose of the certificate section of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.368" offset="3448874">We take the position that the purpose of Section 207 (a) which is the certificate section, is to assure the public of adequate service.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.407" offset="3480952">It is not to resolve a labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.039" offset="3491506">It is not to punish a union carrier who in good faith collectively bargains with its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.272" offset="3520449">And it is not to reward a nonunion carrier for carrying on a fight with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.158" offset="3543960">We take the position that Section 207 (a) has as its purpose, the achievement of a long term balance between supply and demand of transportation service, this on a normal basis and not on a temporary or an abnormal basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.572" offset="3605608">We argue before this Court that in using Section 207 (a) as the Commission did which contemplated permanent certification of motor carrier services, that the Commission had misapplied the Act, that it has created a permanent carrier only to meet a temporary situation.</text>

            <label>Mr. David D. Weinberg</label>
            <text syncTime="2232.024" offset="9031450">It had that too in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.830" offset="9038660">The first paragraph in the clause had, "It shall not be a cause for discharge for an individual employee to refuse to handle unfair goods."</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.254" offset="9080351">But then it went further and stated that the employer would have to act upon proper notice from the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.244" offset="9120371">I think that clause is in the record here and I think Mr. Axelrod will help me find it so that you can read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.756" offset="9146389">But the main gist of this situation is this, that the ICC is in conflict with the National Labor policy in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.078" offset="9215666">If the ICC could act in this case, this would constitute a method of regulating labor disputes in the transportation industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.127" offset="9267911">The award of a certificate to a rival carrier is at least as forceful, a method of regulation as an award of damages for failure to serve the public which would fall under the Garmon decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.303" offset="9344606">It is irrelevant in examining this situation for the Commission not to look to the merits of a labor dispute and to say that it is not attempting to resolve that labor dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.320" offset="9400613">The question is entirely one of the effect and this Court had the opportunity to consider that in Local 24 versus Oliver, Revel versus Oliver, 358 U.S. 283, where this Court held that Ohio could not outlaw owner operator clauses which were authorized by National Labor laws even though the state policy was designed only to adjust relationships in the world of commerce and completely disregarded labor relations implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.581" offset="9549720">So here in this case, it is indisputable that National Labor policy authorizes voluntary compliance with "hot cargo" clauses voluntarily entered into prior to 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.230" offset="9620250">Congress not only failed but refused to distinguish application of that policy in the field of transportation from its application in other fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.602" offset="9669778">This Court decided that very fact in a very famous case, Amalgamated versus Wisconsin Employment Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.262" offset="9708440">And in that case, if I may quote just one paragraph from your decision, “No distinction between public utilities and national manufacturing organizations has been drawn in the administration of a Federal Act, referring to the National Labor Relations Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.711" offset="9794226">And when separate treatment for public utilities were urged on Congress in 1947, the suggested differentiation was expressly rejected by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.521" offset="9853471">And in a footnote in the Amalgamated case, you quote that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.134" offset="9879907">You bring out in your opinion Senator Taft's remarks about voluntarism in collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.024" offset="9919509">So in other words, Congress did not put public utilities under our national labor policy in a different position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.246" offset="9956394">The non-public utilities didn't put common carriers in a different position than non-common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.640" offset="9993906">And under the Oliver case, when it applied the antitrust laws, under the Valentine Act of Ohio, this was no different than what the ICC was doing in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.922" offset="10051062">The effect of it was to interfere with and conflict with your national labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.644" offset="10081991">So here, to allow the Commission to grant certificates because of temporary stoppages would impair the freedom of unions and employers in the transportation industry to bargain collectively and voluntarily to perform their valid labor contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.415" offset="10165060">Congress refused to impose different restrictions upon public utility unions and employers than on others because of their greater impact on the public of service stoppages resulting from public utility strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.897" offset="10230993">Therefore, we -- this Court couldn't allow a state public utility commission to do the very thing the ICC did because there would be conflict with federal policy with regard to labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.989" offset="10287313">In the same breadth, you couldn't allow one agency of the Government, the Interstate Commerce Commission, to interfere with, overlap, conflict with another congressional policy as set out in the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.502" offset="10357426">This is for Congress to determine not the ICC, not any agency of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.714" offset="10390235">Here, you have a clash of perhaps two congressional policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.582" offset="10413746">But rather than that type of a clash, you got a clash of an agency meeting head on with the congressional policy that cannot be reconciled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.406" offset="10457004">And therein, lies the danger in this type of decision, therein lies the danger in the Interstate Commerce Commission in entering into this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.709" offset="10502248">Now, to sustain the Commission's decision in this respect, it would be necessary to hold that Congress by imposing upon common carriers, duties and responsibilities to the public, but have to curtail the freedom to enter into involuntarily performed, collective bargaining agreements that this Court sustained in the Sand Door case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.077" offset="10615724">You sustained as legal under Taft-Hartley 319 39, "hot cargo" clauses very similar to the one involved in this case.</text>
