            <text syncTime="28.605" offset="217840">Mr. Chief Justice Warren, Honorable Members of the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.495" offset="237380">This case is here on certiorari to the Supreme Court of Illinois and it comes here as an aftermath to the case of Griffin against Illinois in 351 United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.617" offset="293804">This case presents the question whether a convicted defendant whose poverty has precluded him from obtaining appellate review and therefore prevented the trial proceedings that were begun against him from being completed is entitled to a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.137" offset="383875">The facts in this case are these, the petitioner Willie Norvell was an 18-year-old colored boy in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.138" offset="423894">He and his brother James and his brother-in-law Edgar Shepherd were indicted for murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.647" offset="457958">The petitioner at that time and at all times between then and now was indigent and have no money, whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.315" offset="488678">However, his family retained counsel to represent him at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.610" offset="509785">The defendants waive trial by jury and were trying before a judge in the criminal court of Cook County.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.773" offset="538415">The -- at the conclusion of the trial, all three defendants were found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.227" offset="560253">Petitioner, Willie Norvell, was sentenced to 199 years in the Illinois State Penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.627" offset="581883">The other two defendants were each sentenced to 50 years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.847" offset="606751">At the conclusion of the trial, Mr. Norvell's family no longer had funds with which to retain counsel and counsel did not represent him at any time between 1941 at the end of the trial and 1961 when I was appointed to represent him by the Supreme Court of Illinois, nor did the family have any money with which to buy the trial transcript which as Your Honors know this is necessary in order to present a case to the Illinois Supreme Court, a criminal case in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.312" offset="740603">Nevertheless, efforts were made by the petitioner to determine the cost of a transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.682" offset="766098">An order was entered in the trial court extending the time within which the transcript could be filed and certified but -- and this, Your Honors, is undisputed in the records, solely because the petitioner had no funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.546" offset="821582">Solely because he was a pauper, he was unable to obtain the transcript in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.950" offset="847182">The time expired for the certification of the transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.957" offset="859199">He went down to jail to begin the service, 199 years sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="330.828" offset="1426683">Why would -- how would the State be charged by not giving a transcript to a person because he was indigent if there was no representation made to the court that he was an indigent and that he needed the transcript and wanted one, a free transcript because of his indigency?</text>

            <text syncTime="351.938" offset="1511111">Well, Your Honor, I would answer that in this two-fold fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.582" offset="1525739">In the first place, I think that the State of Illinois will concede today that if in 1941 the court was informed that the man was indigent and did ask for a transcript, that transcript would not have been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.698" offset="1578193">It would have been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.389" offset="1584880">Secondly, when in 1956, the Illinois Supreme Court on remand in the Griffin case wrote its rule to comply with Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.230" offset="1624273">They stated that everyone, whenever convicted, should be given a free transcript and no distinction was drawn as to whether or not a request had been made by the defendant at the time of his trial or conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.711" offset="1690206">And it is our position that the classification that has been established by the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.575" offset="1717687">Now, the outcome of that classification is arbitrary, capricious and unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="577.004" offset="2411395">It was found that a full transcript was necessary in order to present to a reviewing court the errors that he stated were made at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.828" offset="2450683">Nothing further was done in the case between 1956 and 1961 when I was appointed to represent Mr. Norvell by the Supreme Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.463" offset="2493210">At that time, upon checking into the matter, we discovered that two reporters were present at the time of his trial and one of them had died in 1949.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.777" offset="2542529">Hearings were then held in the criminal court of Cook County, and as a result of those hearings, the following facts appear without any contradiction in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.553" offset="2585579">Half of the transcript of the 1941 trial is missing, including all of the State's proof and sheet.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.468" offset="2621210">There are approximately 200 to 250 pages of actual transcript that are -- were contained in the deceased reporter's notebook.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.523" offset="2673455">Further, no one can read the notes of this deceased reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.394" offset="2692995">Efforts have been made not only in this case but in a prior case, the Oscar Bragg case in which I represented Mr. Bragg and it was to the Supreme Court of Illinois twice to construct -- to read the notes of Mr. E.M. Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.123" offset="2751822">Efforts were made throughout the country to find a court reporter who could translate these notes and we were not successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.455" offset="2781184">So that we have the facts in this record, half of the transcript is missing, there notes are eligible and we called witnesses back, all the witnesses we could from the 1941 trial to try to reconstruct the missing portions of the trial and none of these people could recall the testimony that had been given back in 1941 at that trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.053" offset="2859551">So that we have half of the record, including none of the State's case and sheet, whereupon we moved for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.324" offset="2892675">The motion was denied, we appealed to the Supreme Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.316" offset="2904586">The court unanimously affirmed the order denying the motion for a new trial and the cases before this Court on certiorari raising issues under the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.824" offset="2962683">It is our position, if the Court please, in this case that the legal proceedings which were begun against Mr. Norvell in 1941 have never been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.946" offset="3015137">In the Griffin case, this Court recognized that appellate review has now become an integral part of the Illinois trial system for finally adjudicating the guilt or innocence of a defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.334" offset="3076681">And that to deny appellate review to the poor means that many of them may lose their life, liberty or property because of unjust convictions which appellate courts would set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.203" offset="3132165">The petitioner here has never had that appellate review.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.515" offset="3153481">His conviction may be unjust.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.777" offset="3166438">Not only has he never had the appellate review which is guaranteed to him by the constitution and the laws of Illinois, he never can have it insofar as his 1941 trial is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.721" offset="3218265">The approximate cause of this situation is two-fold, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.841" offset="3250761">It is first that in 1941, Illinois unconstitutionally failed to make available to paupers, convicted of crime, free transcripts of the trial or some other means by which they could obtain review.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.929" offset="3319097">And then we have the continuance of that situation until the State's official reporter died in 1949 and it has been discovered that the State's official reporter took a system of shorthand notes that no one now can read.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.887" offset="3386911">Therefore, there is no question about that, if Mr. Norvell had had funds in 1941, he would have been able to obtain review of his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.011" offset="3427453">Because he had no funds, he could not do it and now he can never do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.623" offset="3457860">We think not only that Illinois violated Mr. Norvell's rights in1941 when he was convicted but also that the classification that has been established by Illinois is arbitrary and capricious and violates the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.846" offset="3534764">Illinois -- the Illinois Supreme Court as I mentioned earlier in response to the Chief Justice's question has ruled, in there ruled and written in response to this Court's opinion in the Griffin case, that any person who was convicted before the Griffin case, is entitled to a free transcript if he files a petition setting up certain facts within a certain time and Mr. Norvell did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.565" offset="3641657">What we have here as the thing has worked out is that Illinois says, “We will grant relief to you if your court reporter is still alive or if he is dead if he took a legible system of notes.”</text>
            <text syncTime="909.276" offset="3740505">We submit that this classification of granting review to all persons except those who had -- court reporters who died in the interim and who took a system of shorthand notes that cannot be read is more arbitrary and capricious than granting -- than denying review to persons who are poverty stricken.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.997" offset="3823365">And because as Mr. Justice Harlan pointed out in his dissenting opinion in the Griffin case, the State does not cause a person to become poor but -- and perhaps the defendant himself has -- by his wastefulness has brought about his poverty.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.207" offset="3892224">But how can Mr. Norvell be charged with the help of the State's official court reporter or the way in which he took notes back in 1941.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.624" offset="3929840">We say that if Illinois as it has applies the Griffin rule retrospectively, it must do so without regard to whether the court reporter who took notes if the trial is still alive and without regard to whether or not that court reporter used the system of shorthand which cannot be read.</text>

            <text syncTime="1477.848" offset="6014725">Mr. Sullivan has stated the facts of the case fairly and accurately as he invariably does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.079" offset="6055685">However, I think that I can best present Illinois's argument by restating those facts in the focus of the questions from the bench and distinguishing those facts from those in the cases upon which the petitioner chiefly relies in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.183" offset="6128097">Petitioner, whose race is not so far as I know shown by the record, was indicted for murder in 1941 with two other defendants, pleaded not guilty, waived trial by jury, was tried by the bench and was found guilty of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.322" offset="6236662">He was represented at that time by counsel employed and paid by his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.082" offset="6259649">Its not disputed at least to this juncture of the case that the employment of counsel exhausted petitioner's funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.014" offset="6291414">He then made informal inquiry, perhaps even request of the official court reporter of Cook County or one of them for a gratuitous transcript, what it was then called and still is called in an Illinois criminal case, a bill of exceptions without charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.050" offset="6379604">So far as the record shows and so far as it's contended, the only effort that petitioner made in 1941 to obtain a free transcript which request the court before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.848" offset="6430804">He made no application of any kind to any court for any kind of an order that would entitle him to that transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.630" offset="6757857">Eight years later, Mr. E.H. Allen, the court reporter, died.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.343" offset="6792756">Mr. Sullivan is correct, Mr. E.H. Allen was a venerable court reporter in Cook County for many years, it is considered -- not only in this case but in many others, many others.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.187" offset="6868093">Everybody tells a state's attorney and the Attorney General that nobody can read the notes of E.H. Allen in any of his cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.362" offset="6904769">With his death, they became insoluble cryptograms, a dead script.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.328" offset="6936639">Among such cases was the case of William Highlands which has been through the Supreme Court of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.632" offset="6981883">Another seven years and a few months went by, and in April of 1956, Your Honors decided Griffin against Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.603" offset="7049801">Promptly, upon the announcement of the opinion in that case, the Supreme Court of Illinois promulgated its Rule 65-1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.745" offset="7098389">That rule gives free transcripts or authorizes at least the giving of free transcripts to prisoners who were indigent at that time of their conviction, if they make application before March 1st, 1957.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.590" offset="7189713">Petitioner made such an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.211" offset="7204237">He obtained an order from Judge Crowley, directing that he be given a free transcript of his proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.194" offset="7240182">It then developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.930" offset="7247078">Perhaps it had been previously suspected but it then developed with certainty that was not -- it was impossible to transcribe the notes of Mr. E.H. Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.703" offset="7310190">Thereupon, petitioner brought this proceeding to the Supreme Court of Illinois and elicited the opinion and judgment to which review, which Your Honors have granted to this Court certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.603" offset="7397752">Now, I should like to contrast this case, the case upon which petitioner chiefly relies, Eskridge against Washington Prison Board 357 U.S. 214, decided in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.398" offset="7492942">The opinion is per curiam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.057" offset="7503600">Because of certain passages in the reply brief, I should like to ask the Chief Justice's permission to read less than half page of this opinion so I won't -- I can't possibly misrepresent what is in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.470" offset="7577266">Your Honors say at the bottom of pages -- page 214 and the top of page 215.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.386" offset="7620942">In 1935 after petitioner, now that's petitioner Eskridge in Washington, was convicted of murder in a Washington State Court and sentenced to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.212" offset="7668172">He gave timely notice of appeal to the Supreme Court of the State, end of that quotation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.134" offset="7699937">It appeared that he was indigent and Washington, the Supreme Court of Washington held that Your Honors didn't intend the Griffin case to be retrospect just how the Washington Court could achieve that in conclusion, I don't know, but it did and it declined to give Mr. Eskridge a transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="1931.954" offset="7831176">Now, the Court says at page 216, “The State,” that's the State of Washington, “The State concedes that the reporter's transcript from the 1935 trial is still available.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.835" offset="7922709">In other words, all that Your Honors did in this unanimous per curiam case in the Eskridge case was make the State of Washington what the Supreme Court of Illinois did promptly upon the announcement of the Griffin case in the issuance of the mandate, Rule 65-1 was then drawn.</text>

            <text syncTime="2282.756" offset="9234369">Now, if the Court please, Rule 65-1 does contain a provision which raises no question here but I'll inform the Court of it, that rule by the way is set forth at appendix page 7 of the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.419" offset="9325066">It does provide that you must specify the alleged errors which the petitioner claims occurred at his trial and that he desires to apply for issuance of a writ of error to review the conviction but petitioner did that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.117" offset="9391835">He complied that -- with that and we don't say that he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.272" offset="9408449">And he obtained an order for a transcript under Rule 65-1, but Rule 65-1 contains this provision which occurs at page 8, “In the event, the court finds it is impossible to furnish petitioners to know stenographic transcript for the proceedings of his trial because of the unavailability of the court reporter, who reported the proceedings and the inability of any other court reporter to transcribe the notes of the court reporter who served at the trial or for any other reason the court shall deny the petition.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.753" offset="9630386">Of course, all that does is recognize what, as Mr. Justice Harlan so principally said, is an impossibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.889" offset="9662882">There's really nothing gained -- it makes no -- by granting a petition that mounts only where a rule on a man who is dead and buried to transcribe his notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.561" offset="9713664">Now, eight -- now, 15 years after his conviction and more than seven years after the death of Mr. Allen, petitioner made application under Rule 65-1 and obtained this order for a free transcript.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.544" offset="9821497">The notes could not be transcribed and the Supreme Court of Illinois, as I say, wrote the opinion, it's now here for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.633" offset="9857860">Now, at this -- the second case upon which petitioner principally relies is the Westbrook case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit arising in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.813" offset="9926614">In the Westbrook case, Westbrook was not a pauper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.450" offset="9965171">There may be an inadvertent statement in Illinois brief that he was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.887" offset="9982934">He wasn't a pauper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.032" offset="9991502">Within the hundred days, he requested a bill of exceptions and he offered to pay for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.778" offset="10034448">And he got several extensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.300" offset="10048554">The reason he didn't get it was that the reporter developed multiple sclerosis, left the State and refused to transcribe anything for anybody, no matter how much he was paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.849" offset="10122742">There, timely application had been made, had been persisted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.761" offset="10150431">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit says in this statement quotation is criticized in petition of reply brief here, that Westbrook “filed a timely notice of appeal.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.587" offset="10281671">Actually, that's inaccurate because notice of appeal isn't ordinarily used and until recently couldn't be used in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.891" offset="10318973">What you filed was a press for a writ of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.095" offset="10335796">Well, the court -- petitioner's counsel takes the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit to pass for this inaccurate statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.988" offset="10367352">But what the Court of Appeals meant is correct that he evinced the record his desire for a transcript within the time provided for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.902" offset="10411029">He didn't make a showing of poverty because he wasn't a pauper but he did come up with money.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.360" offset="10444779">Now, in that case, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit did say that -- and they relied on the timeliness of the application that in that case sits, it wasn't possible to grant a timely application or a report of proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.196" offset="10556165">The petitioner was entitled to a new trial and Illinois did seek certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.408" offset="10593050">Now, in the instant case, the situation is that petitioner made no effort for 15 years to obtain a free transcript.</text>

            <text syncTime="3537.964" offset="14255208">As I understand the argument of the State of Illinois, it is in short that the petitioner here should not be given any relief solely because at the time he was tried, he did not ask that he be given a transcript of the trial without payment of cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.790" offset="14346533">Now, it may be that this Court will hold that the Griffin case does not extend retrospectively to those who did not request transcripts, as Mr. Wines points out the Eskridge case involved the person who did ask for a free transcript, although he didn't raise a constitutional point in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.594" offset="14453739">However, when this -- when the Griffin case went back to the Supreme Court of Illinois, the Supreme Court of Illinois itself resolved that issue for Illinois.</text>

            <text syncTime="3611.711" offset="14550183">Your Honor, I say as did Mr. Wines, that if the transcript cannot be prepared, there's no point in having an order directing that it'd be prepared.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.227" offset="14592293">The rule doesn't say what shall happen if this case arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.194" offset="14608175">If the transcript can't be prepared, the petition shall be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.568" offset="14621654">The question here is whether a new trial should thereupon be granted and this rule does not expressly state or even by implication that no other relief should be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.112" offset="14663868">The Illinois Supreme Court looked at this question of waiver, they looked at this question of whether we should hold it against the man that he didn't make an application back in 1941 or whenever he was tried and they said this, “We have considered the applicability of the doctrine of waiver, it could be held that a prisoner who did not request a free transcript within the time has waived his right but waiver assumes knowledge and we are unwilling to hold under the circumstances of this case that the constitutional rights of prisoners have been waived.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.640" offset="14817886">It is the same notion that this Court expressed several weeks ago in the Noia case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.467" offset="14841292">In order for there to be a waiver there must be an intelligent, knowing, giving up of a right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.621" offset="14861876">That's the very same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.741" offset="14866369">Now Illinois has said we will not hold it against you indigent defendants but at the time you were convicted you didn't apply for a free transcript or raised a constitutional question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.106" offset="14911822">Therefore, in the final analysis, the only difference between Mr. Monroe, whom Mr. Justice Douglas pointed out, was convicted some years before Norvell.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.516" offset="14953409">The only difference between Monroe and Norvell is that Monroe's court reporter is still alive or that the reporter being dead he wrote an eligible system of shorthand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.069" offset="14991653">We say that to deny relief solely because of that circumstance is arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.585" offset="15021746">Norvell was just as prompt in seeking relief as Monroe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.622" offset="15041912">Norvell did nothing to cause this reporter to die or the transcript to be lost, yet he cannot obtain review under the present circumstances and Monroe did.</text>

            <text syncTime="3756.675" offset="15130102">Under the rule he's entitled on a showing of indigency to get the transcript as I read the rule.</text>
