            <label>Mr. E. Clinton Bamberger, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="27.762" offset="214392">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.825" offset="234663">This was an appeal more from a mandate of the Court of Appeals, and from its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.067" offset="259636">The Court of Appeals of Maryland agreed with the Petitioner's contention in that Court that he had been denied due process when the prosecutor withheld a confession, which the petitioner's accomplice had made to the prosecuting authorities, to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.555" offset="337586">But having agreed that due process of law had been denied to the petitioner, the Court of Appeals then by its mandate, respected the relief to a new trial on the question of punishment only.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.994" offset="399339">It did not disturb the verdict of guilt, the verdict of guilt of murder in first -- of murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.583" offset="437687">And the Court of Appeals would by its mandate send the case back to the Trial Court for the plaintiff, if he would so elect, to have a trial before a jury with guilt already determined and only for the purpose of determining whether the jury would say he is guilty without capital punishment and so respect the court's power to impose capital punishment or merely say guilty and leave the court free to impose capital punishment or to sentence to imprisonment for life.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.015" offset="587421">One fact, peculiar to this case, peculiar to Maryland and I think also to Indiana, but at the base of this case to which I would direct the Court's attention, is that in Maryland the jury in a criminal case is the judge of the law as well as the judge of the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.696" offset="674147">And the Court's instructions to a jury in a criminal case in Maryland are advisory only, not binding on the jury, and the words of the Court of Appeals go to the jury merely as a means of enlightenment.</text>

            <text syncTime="167.643" offset="773935">I think then we would have a more basic consideration of whether the depravation of the constitutional right is the violation of such a thing so sacred that we are not going to leave any Appellate Court to try to sift out what the affect of this might be.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.152" offset="904025">He had murdered.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Clinton Bamberger, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="203.759" offset="918444">He was participating in a robbery and there was homicide in the course of the robbery, and if the jury found those facts and they were -- some of them were denied by him in some respects and there was a contention made on appeal that the robbery had been completed before the homicide occurred, but there certainly were facts from which the jury could very easily find, aside from this confession, could very easily find that he had -- it was a felony murder and under binding instruction would be guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.129" offset="1055848">What had happened here was that a man named Brooks was murdered in the course of a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.462" offset="1089181">The petitioner, Brady and his companion Boblit were arrested several days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.278" offset="1116453">The petitioner was arrested first.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.238" offset="1124289">He had fled to Cuba and then had returned, surrendered himself and was return to the Federal Bureau of Investigation Office in Miami.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.446" offset="1165145">A day after that, as a result of some statements made by the petitioner in Florida, his companion Boblit was arrested in Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.759" offset="1206418">Now statements were taken from both of these men.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.363" offset="1220838">Of course the important statements are the first four statements taken from the Petitioner's companion, Boblit.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.550" offset="1257618">In each of those four statements, Boblit said, I didn't commit the homicide, I didn't commit the killing, Brady did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.795" offset="1294503">But after Boblit knew that the petitioner was in the custody of the police and after the police in Maryland had taken some statements from the petitioner, the police went to Boblit, the companion and they said, there are some discrepancies in these first four stories, which you have given us.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.779" offset="1378513">Now he knows the police speak of discrepancies, he knows his companion is in the same jail house and he now makes a fifth statement, and in this fifth statement he, Boblit, admits that not Brady, not the petitioner, but he Boblit was the person who actually committed the killing.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.680" offset="1462105">And one other significant thing about this fifth statement is that at the end of it, when he was asked to sign it, he refused to sign it, although he had signed the first four statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.070" offset="1511633">These two men had separate counsels.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.412" offset="1525008">In the course of preparing for trial, counsel for this petitioner asked the prosecutor for copies of the statements, not only made by the petitioner, but also the statements made by Boblit.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.580" offset="1581641">The prosecutor gave to counsel for the petitioner only the first four statements made by Boblit.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.508" offset="1609435">The four statements in which Boblit said, I didn't do it, the petitioner here Brady did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.418" offset="1633050">He did not, the prosecutor did not give to the petitioner's counsel, nor inform the petitioner's council of the existence of the fifth unsigned statement, which at least in the one detail, the fact that Boblit, not the petitioner was the actual murderer corroborated the petitioner's defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="435.055" offset="1843597">I don't know that it adds anything, but I did want to set the chronology, that the withholding occurred prior to this petitioner's trial, prior to the time when a jury found that he was guilty of first degree murder and my argument on the denial of due process is that when the Court of Appeals found that this withholding denied due process, that everything that happened from that point on was unfair, that this denial vitiates all that happened, at least all that happened after that and in some circumstances could even affect things that happened before.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.708" offset="1990196">But here was a man who was deprived of what the Court agrees he was entitled too, prior to the time of his trial of guilt, and the Court of Appeals doesn't put him back there.

            <text syncTime="549.621" offset="2301889">But this is where the evil of the -- where the equal protection is denied, because the trial to which Brady was entitled was a trial with this information, and the Court of Appeals has said he should have had this when he asked for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="909.777" offset="3742490">They recognized also that even through this evidence looking at it as a lawyer, purely as a lawyer, even though this evidence simply most directly effected the punishment, yet the failure of the court to grant a severance in this case amounted to such a denial of due process, that the cases were remanded for separate trials on both the issues of guilt and punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1420.832" offset="5786728">One thread follows throughout the proceedings in this case and that is that the defendant, Brady, the appellant here, has consistently and universally admitted that he participated in the robbery, in which Mr. William Brooks was murdered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.723" offset="5890278">During the preparation for the trial of the case in the Circuit Court of Anne Arundel County, Brady's attorney had a conference with the state attorney and in the judge's chambers and also with the counsel for the accomplice named Boblit and it appears on page 26 of the record, Mr. Wolfel, the counsel said, I recall I stated that in view of the fact that they took a jury trial, I wanted mine first, actually the accomplice didn't take a jury trial, then he went on to say and that the case would be limited to penalty for murder in the first degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.661" offset="6066030">Question; well why would it be limited to that penalty sir?</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.496" offset="6077315">Answer; because that was absolutely no justification or reason or rhythm or rhyme for killing a man, and both of them were at least engaged in robbery or larceny and so forth.</text>
