            <text syncTime="326.836" offset="1410696">Well, that -- in other words, that by virtue of prior decisions by this Court particularly before Mapp v. Ohio that the evidence and the question was admissible that therefore, the state criminal defendant or the state criminal respondent did not have an adequate remedy at law that therefore, it followed that a federal injunction was necessary if the defendant's or respondent's federal rights were to be protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.876" offset="1510902">Now, under this argument, resort in effect has had to the equity side of this Court in order to circumvent or overrule the decisions of this Court rendered at law it is a completely anomalous procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.231" offset="1572342">Our contention is that there's nothing magical about a proceeding in equity that a state criminal defendant or respondent does not transmute his federal rights simply by becoming a plaintiff in equity in the United States District Court that if for some reason, the decisions of this Court should not be followed or it goes -- a dissatisfaction with those decisions then -- or if those decisions should be overruled, this should be done directly in Fort Riley at law by this Court upon a reconsideration of the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.850" offset="1706820">But this Court should not allow this to be done indirectly by a flanking attack which not only really obscures the considerations involved in the merits but which creates a needless and gratuitous conflict between the state and the federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="693.159" offset="2875956">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.919" offset="2895078">It seems to me that there are but two questions presented upon this matter before this Court as set forth in the brief of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.899" offset="2966967">The first is whether it is an improvident exercise of federal equitable power to enjoin the petitioner from testifying in either a state court or before the Waterfront Commission of the Court of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.877" offset="3046902">It seems to me that my opponent has avoided the very question that was raised initially in the District Court and also decided by the Circuit Court and that is this; what position did Cleary assume once he came in and aided and abetted the federal officers in committing these unlawful acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.022" offset="3163512">There is no question that the federal officers did commit unlawful acts because even Judge Anderson who dissented in the Circuit Court from that part of the opinion that continued the injunction in effect because at page 23 of the petition for writ of certiorari, Judge Anderson says this, “There was a good reason at the time of the issuance of the injunction by the trial court before the Supreme Court's holding in Mapp v. Ohio, supra, to encode within its reach, Cleary, the state official, to prevent a violation of Bolger's constitutional rights”.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.258" offset="3344384">So Bolger then had no other recourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.278" offset="3360475">So I must assume that Judge Anderson found that for the purposes of this case at least, Cleary became a federal agent when he aided and abetted these federal agents in the Commission of this illegal act.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.977" offset="3419303">And it is my understanding of the law that one who aides and abet others in the Commission of any illegal act becomes a part -- possible (Inaudible) conspiracy and any acts committed during the conspiracy are chargeable, this person at the jury is before the completion of the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.060" offset="3499656">Now, while it is true that the District Court and the Circuit Court confined their opinion to the fact that Cleary by being invited in by the federal agents listened to and observed certain things.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.935" offset="3603101">But as Judge Bryan said in his opinion, Cleary did more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.845" offset="3630791">He became an active participant in these acts of the Customs officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.212" offset="3660257">Because when they brought Bolger back to 201 Varick Street, New York City at which time Cleary had been called by the Customs officers, both Cleary and Lockland, one of the federal Customs officers, compelled Bolger to empty his pockets, questioned him about some keys that he had and when they discovered that one of the keys fitted a storeroom in some apartment building, I believe it was at 75th Street Western Avenue in Manhattan, compelled Bolger to accompany them in an automobile, took him into this house, compelled him to open the door and conducted a search in his premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.813" offset="3826604">Of course, the petitioner would like to dispose of that matter by saying, well, there was no contraband found there.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.429" offset="3857115">But that is not the important thing whether or not contraband was found there or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.316" offset="3872684">The important thing I believe is that when they forced Bolger to empty his pockets, when they forced him to accompany them to 75th Street, and they forced him to open the door, Bolger's (Inaudible) acts, it were clearly illegal acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.999" offset="3939349">The same as the other acts committed by the federal officers prior to the time they took Bolger to Keansburg, New Jersey.</text>

            <text syncTime="998.613" offset="4097860">I proceeded on the theory that Cleary became a federal officer for the pertinences of this case at least when he joined in with these other federal agents.</text>

            <text syncTime="2234.435" offset="9041063">To me -- to my way of thinking rather, the question as it has been resolved both by Judge Bryan and by the Court of Appeals in their opinion has disposed of this and I believe that number one, beginning about Mapp against Ohio when Bol -- when Cleary joined this unholy alliance of the Customs officers, he became a federal officer and he was amenable to the federal rules and the provisions of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.357" offset="9188812">It brings to my mind the line of cases where I distinctly recall a New York City police officer acting solely on behalf of the United States Government come in to the federal court with the case, the fact that the New York City police officer didn't make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.995" offset="9251401">They are bound by constitutional provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2293.516" offset="9277419">Though I say, that there's no question that Cleary for the purpose of this case became a federal agent and that is what in the essence or in effect the opinions of the lower courts hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.895" offset="9338964">And so far as the second point of the prosecutions here delayed, in my brief, I state very clearly, very carefully that they could proceed any time they want with the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.300" offset="9408554">I have gone in to the formal court special sessions in New York County which is now the criminal court because I have demanded a trial that this case had been on 29 or 34 times now and I'm on a trial and the District Attorney said, “Well, we're not ready and under my objection the Court has adjourned the case again”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.917" offset="9495071">Of course we have a case in the New York Court of Appeals called Prosser against the United States where I suppose, I could ultimately claim that I haven't been given a speedy trial and therefore move for a dismissal of the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.408" offset="9548988">But they might say to me, but it's your fault, you've got the injunction.</text>
