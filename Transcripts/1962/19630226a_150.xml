            <label>Mr. A. Donald Mackinnon</label>
            <text syncTime="10.018" offset="143444">Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.017" offset="171447">At the outset of my argument, I wish to state that the Stock Exchange does not take the position that it can act maliciously with predatory motives or in bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.804" offset="242604">Such is not and never has been our contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.249" offset="264338">We say that we must act in good faith and that we did so act and that is the standard by which we shall be judged.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.300" offset="316583">At the outset, I would like to state what a stock exchange is, what it does, and what it is required to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.006" offset="367365">The Stock Exchange is an unincorporated association in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.739" offset="398294">It has 1,375 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.417" offset="425044">It is and always has been regulated by the membership, by the Stock Exchange with the enactment of the 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.196" offset="504142">There was a decided strengthening of that regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.727" offset="530265">Now, the Exchange is required to police and discipline its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.420" offset="569031">That duty is imposed upon it by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.904" offset="594944">The Stock Exchange is jealous of the financial standing and repute of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.790" offset="634546">It is jealous of protecting that which it is required to protect the rep -- its take -- its reputation and standing for the protection of investors and to ensure equitable and just principles of trade which Congress has imposed upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.264" offset="728377">Now, it has a high degree of accountability and it endeavors and always has endeavored to maintain that degree of accountability.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.970" offset="799222">Very obviously, no rules and regulations of the Exchange would be enforced or could be enforceable if 1,375 members were to go their various ways and say that they would do as they please.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.407" offset="888978">Because of that fact, it is the Exchange that has the duty to see that its members enforce its rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.743" offset="946343">And in doing so, obviously, there are restraints imposed upon the freedom of action of members.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.031" offset="991483">Now, we furnish an auction market for 1,100 odd listings of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.246" offset="1056371">When our members deal with one another as they are required to do when a member comes in and offers a security for sale and another member buys a security, they must deal with one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.288" offset="1128573">They must of necessity and we as an exchange must of necessity be interested in their financial responsibility and in their integrity, so that when and as our members, as they did in this particular case, have private wires, we were and has the duty of being interested in the person who had the wire connection with the member firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.795" offset="1286562">Now, I should like at this point to deal very briefly with the 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.424" offset="1329089">And in doing so, I would like to refer very briefly to a portion of Section 2, which is entitled necessity for regulation as provided in this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.087" offset="1403695">And to emphasize for Your Honors that what was designed was the regulation of securities transactions as commonly conducted on securities exchanges and over-the-counter markets stating that they were affected with a national public interest which makes it necessary to provide for the regulation and control of such transactions, and of practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.587" offset="1545697">And I underscore the words, “of practices”, and matters related thereto.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.241" offset="1572342">And further, and to impose requirements necessary to make such regulation and control reasonably, complete, and effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.057" offset="1639633">Now, that is what Congress said and then they provided for the registration of national securities exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.681" offset="1706088">And we are a registered national security exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.855" offset="1730748">And under Section 6 of the cert -- 1934 Act, we were required by Congress to meet certain terms and conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.772" offset="1786441">And to file a registration statement which provided that we would agree to comply and, and again I emphasize, to enforce so far as within its powers compliance by its members with the provisions of the 1934 Act and any amendment thereto, and any rule or regulation made or to be made thereunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.446" offset="1941191">We were then required to file data with respect to our organization, rules of procedure, membership, etcetera, and further, copies of our constitution, articles and incorporation, and all amendment, and of its existing bylaws or rules, or instruments corresponding thereto, whatever the name, which were collectively referred to as rules of the Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.274" offset="2088417">We also hand to agree to furnish the Commission with any amendments for changes in our rules, forthwith upon adoption.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.533" offset="2149543">Now, Section 6 (b) provides that no exchange shall be granted registration for that the registration shall remain enforced unless the rules of the Exchange include provision for the expulsion, suspension for disciplining of a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.112" offset="2247868">Now, obviously, no exchange could operate on the basis of one rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.886" offset="2278902">So the Act then provides that nothing in the title shall be construed to prevent any exchange from adopting and enforcing any rule not inconsistent with the Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and the applicable laws of the state in which the exchange is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.011" offset="2391437">Then we come to, what in my opinion, is an exceedingly important part of the Act dealing with registration and that is that it must appear because now we have the duty imposed upon the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.046" offset="2471581">It states, if it appears to the Commission that the exchange applying for registration is so organized as to be able to comply with the provisions of this title and the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of, and that the rules of the exchange are just and adequate to ensure fair dealing, and to protect investors, the Commission shall pose such exchange to be registered as a national securities exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.979" offset="2643257">In other words, there is an affirmative duty cast upon the Commission to determine that the exchange is so setup, that it can enforce its rules, and that its rules are designed to protect investors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1625.053" offset="6603630">Now obviously when we state in our rules that were on file that we will have the right to approve member firm wires with nonmembers and to discontinue member firm wires with nonmembers that is a specific rule that was approved by the Commission under its responsibilities under Section 6 (d) before they registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.818" offset="6774680">Now, in addition to that, there is a provision that if we fail to enforce the rule, enforce the act and enforce the rules that we, under Section 19 (a) can have our registration suspended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.242" offset="6864332">We can have it suspended for a period of 12 months or even withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.790" offset="6890559">The law and the Bear case, Bear versus Franklin has said and it seems to me self-evident that the Exchange not only has the duty to enact rules and regulations but to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.903" offset="6978957">Now, that being the case, here, you are dealing with a rule or rules that were filed with the SEC that the SEC affirmatively found in approving registration that the rule was just and adequate to ensure fair dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.390" offset="7072893">And you will recall that the Solicitor General and the same was true of the District Court petitioner, they did nothing that the Commission had scrutinized the rules with any care and that as far as these rules were concerned, it was more or less lip service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.330" offset="7172681">But the Act, the order of approval and the annual report shows that they did in fact analy -- examine and analyze these rules as they were required to do before they accorded this registration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.852" offset="7338820">In addition to 19 (a), there is a 19 (b) provision, and the 19 (b) provision provides that the Commission can, if it is supposed to do so, tell us to change our rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.110" offset="7395767">And if we do not do so, that they can order a hearing and after the hearing promulgate a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.407" offset="7425024">In addition thereto under Section 23 (a), the Commission can't issue rules of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.648" offset="7453968">And these rules and regulations are subject to review by a person agreed under Section 25 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.462" offset="7493256">Now, and I want to go a step further than this because it is my position that there can be no question but what anybody reading the Congressional and Senate reports that this -- the Dickinson report at the time of the organization, the SEC knows that the responsibilities were imposed upon the Exchange to enact and to enforce its rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.775" offset="7602448">There is no question in my mind that as far as the petitioners here are concerned, if they were disposed to do so that they could have brought immediately into the Commission and said, we are a person aggrieved, and as a person aggrieved, we tell you that we want action with respect to this rule, under which the private wire between members and ourselves were discontinued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.572" offset="7737657">And they could do that and despite the fact that the Government, the Solicitor General failed to state so that is the position that he took in his brief at page 17 where he said, “Well, neither the Securities Exchange Act nor the Commission rules of practice, specifically authorized the filing of a complaint with the agency by a person adversely affected by a rule of an exchange, the Commission would ordinarily entertain such a complaint, if it made substantial allegations.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.743" offset="7906304">And here, they chose another course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.186" offset="7924067">They chose to saddle us or attempt to saddle us with a liability which would be treble to with, in this particular case, if and we are charged with the -- with the duty of enforcing a rule if we enforce them through mistake of judgment, not now saying good faith because I say, good faith is a standard that Your Honors must apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.155" offset="8035976">But we face, according to petitioners contention with a liability of $3 million and also potentially criminal liabilities as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.566" offset="8097625">I say that Congress at no time could possibly have ever conceived a remedy such as that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3006.144" offset="12127901">Now, the cause of action in this case is in one sense, a plain ordinary concerted refusal to deal on the part of the member firms of the New York Stock Exchange who were named as co-conspirators with the exchange in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.676" offset="12242108">But it's more than that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3056.552" offset="12329566">And we say, because this is really the reason that the Solicitor General is so concerned about in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.787" offset="12350568">He's concerned because of the fact that he thinks that it may, if you apply the per se rule here, you may weaken the concept to self-regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.687" offset="12378154">We don't have that problem here, let me tell you why.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.110" offset="12395813">We don't have the problem because it is just as much a violation of the Sherman Act per se for competitors to foreclose another competitor from any substantial market as it is for competitors to foreclose competition among themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.301" offset="12472613">And in this case, the record is clear that the over-the-counter dealers who were the member firms of the New York Stock Exchange, with whom these petitioners have private wires, were competitors of these petitioners in the over-the-counter market in Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.295" offset="12548577">And what happened was, is that the combined action of the Exchange and its member firms in the Dallas area excluded these petitioners from the Dallas market, force them out of business.</text>

            <text syncTime="3219.622" offset="12981896">Well, I think we've got to distinguish the case of the ex-racketeer from the case of the bucket shop because let's talk first about the bucket shop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.477" offset="13029230">If we talk about the bucket shop and we have a situation in which the Exchange tells a member firm, stop dealing with the bucket shop and the member firm says, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.153" offset="13075937">What we're talking about at that point is member misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.115" offset="13103835">If we're talking about a situation where there are qualifications involved, the qualifications of this ex-racketeer to engage in the securities business, well he can't be qualified to engage in this business unless the Securities and Exchange Commission says that it's all right for him to engage in this business and that's gone from Section 15 of the broker-dealer registration provisions of the 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.135" offset="13219924">And they comment, “The criteria set forth in Section 15 are the only criteria that Congress has laid down for admission into the securities business.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3538.926" offset="14259075">If the Exchange had the power that it says it has, and this Court gives it to him, it's got the power also to regulate the relations between members of the Exchange and members of other registered securities exchanges in connection with private wires relating to over-the-counter securities transactions or securities transactions on an exchange other than the New York Stock Exchange.</text>

            <text syncTime="3594.976" offset="14483310">And actually Congress did know such thing, because the balance that has been drawn by the Solicitor General is in our view an erroneous balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.665" offset="14526046">What he's talking about is a balance between protection of the investor and the rights of the individual broker-dealer.</text>

            <text syncTime="3638.251" offset="14656345">Congress rule it and they drew it in Section 6 (b) of the 1934 Act, where they said and I quote, “No registration shall be granted or remain enforced unless the rules of the exchange include provision for the expulsion, suspension, or disciplining of a member for conduct or proceeding inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.”</text>
