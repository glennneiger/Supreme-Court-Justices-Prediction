            <label>Mr. Burke Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="10.220" offset="144280">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.883" offset="162879">I should like to start by stating briefly the interest of the United States in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.209" offset="192240">These are the first school desegregation cases which the Court has taken for argument since Cooper against Aaron.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.554" offset="229543">The United States participated in Cooper against Aaron, and also in the Brown cases both on the merits and on relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.005" offset="267368">So our participation in these cases reflects a continuing national policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.256" offset="300387">The cases themselves involved an important question of the constitutionality of transfer provisions in Knoxville in Davidson County, Tennessee which operate explicitly on the grounds of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.810" offset="374575">Put in their most favorable light, these transfer rules are designed to permit children of both races to avoid the effects of desegregation, although, as I shall develop, in doing so, they also compelled children to go to particular schools because of their race.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.250" offset="472377">The transfer rules reflect to some degree, the deep-seeded fears of some parents in these places and elsewhere in the area of desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.825" offset="534653">The legal assumption behind the rules is that the school boards may give effect to these fears in the administration of the school districts by permitting transfer of children depending upon their race and depending upon the majority -- of the race of the majority of the other children in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.565" offset="633605">In our view, this legal assumption is wrong, and it derives from presumptions about race which undermine the Brown case.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.594" offset="689716">The presumptions being that it is harmful for children of both races to go to school together and it is a proper aim of Government to take steps that design to permit them to go to school separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.843" offset="774771">The United States is also interested in these cases because the situations which are presented in them are not unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.281" offset="812492">The States of Alabama, Arkansas, North Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida, all have statutes which are -- which say in effect that no child of either race may against his wishes be compelled to go to a school where he will be in the minority racially.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.920" offset="907055">In addition, transfer plans of this sort have been introduced in other cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.619" offset="933804">They are now in effect in Nashville, in Memphis, and Humphrey County in Tennessee, and were included but turned down by the courts in Chattanooga and Obion County.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.142" offset="987930">In Virginia, they are now a part of the plans in Lynchburg, Arlington, Alexandria, and Warren County.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.565" offset="1021680">And in Virginia, they were also included but turned down by the Fourth Circuit in the Charlotte's Bill Plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.806" offset="1054595">So there is presented the possibility that if these rules are proved in these cases that they will spread and become a part of the pattern of desegregation throughout the entire area of desegregation under the Brown case.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.120" offset="1139858">These rules start with an unquestioned use of racial criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.828" offset="1162637">They treat children differently, depending solely upon their race.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.538" offset="1181550">White children may transfer when Negroes may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.484" offset="1197328">And Negroes may transfer when whites may not.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.652" offset="2754017">There was about a -- six years ago, a series of purges in the number of parishes in Louisiana, all initiated under Louisiana law by the private citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.762" offset="2810441">But the courts have ordered the Negroes that were purged from the roles under those circumstances restored to their roles because the purge was discriminatory in the sense that whites were not purged at the same time as Negroes, even though the impetus came from the decision of a private individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.842" offset="2910751">I think the Burton case, which this Court decided two years ago is another analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.767" offset="2942412">In the Burton case, a private restaurant man was given the use of state property in Wilmington and he discriminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.458" offset="2985253">It was his private decision but he did it through state property, public property, property that was supposed to be used for the public, and this Court struck that down.</text>

            <text syncTime="3066.755" offset="12370422">The notice was sent out and I'm looking at page 249 and 250 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.914" offset="12403022">The notice was actually set out to every county by their child where they were in a situation that the new zoning required them to transfer, required them be assigned on another school.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.266" offset="12472404">And it starts off in the notice, in the transfer request and it says school zone in which you lived, in other words this is where you are now zoned, in accordance with the notice which is on 249.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.439" offset="12537083">This is the one in which you are now zoned.</text>

            <text syncTime="3114.388" offset="12560906">Now unless that child brought this notice back saying, I do not want to be moved over and then moved back, I do not want to be moved over then you would stay in that location.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.806" offset="12622555">Now the practical, the administrative reason for that that is that you didn't actually physically take the child from the school that he was now attending, to the school to which it was assigned and then let the child transfer back into school to which he was assigned, to the school that he had formally been attending if that's the school he wanted to go to, was that you would have the paperwork of: number one, the child turning in the books; Number two, the child's transfer papers with the State going over to the assigned school then the transfer papers again being made out about what the state rules and all of these appears in the record to bring that child back to the other school and books reassigned.</text>

            <text syncTime="3257.161" offset="13132048">First, that this Court had not decided and has not yet decided that the states must deprive persons of the right to choose what schools they attend but rather all they have decided is that a state may not deny to a person on account of race, the right to attend any school it maintains.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.952" offset="13251166">And that two, if those schools which it maintains are open to the children of all races, with the zone limitation of course which is a practical limitation that was recognized in the Brown cases, that if the schools which it maintains are open to the children of all races then there's no violation of the Constitution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3314.116" offset="13359835">And finally, that there was no evidence there in the Sixth Circuit as there is no evidence in this record in either the Maxwell or Goss cases that the transfer plan is any evasive scheme concocted in order to bring about or continue segregation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3363.069" offset="13555649">And I'm now leaving the reasoning of Mr. Justice McAllister.</text>

            <text syncTime="3391.539" offset="13669543">And insofar as the State or the school board here is concerned, no child is prevented from attending a particular school because of his or her race.</text>

            <text syncTime="4046.886" offset="16290879">I'm not sure that the latter statute was correct, Mr. Justice Black.</text>
            <text syncTime="4053.100" offset="16315747">The Knoxville plan has been interpreted by those who administered in Knoxville as according to members of the Negro majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.375" offset="16360887">Free transfers wherever they want to go or call.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.424" offset="16389099">I do not know whether Knoxville has indulged that liberality of treatment or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4078.740" offset="16418356">If that is clearly established by the Knoxville record on page 94, where Mr. -- Doctor Burkhart has testified and also by the man who was actually in-charge of transfers, Mr. (Inaudible) at pages 117 and 118.</text>
            <text syncTime="4101.210" offset="16508217">That does not go to the question which Mr. Justice Goldberg asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="4105.993" offset="16527339">Namely, whether a member of the Negro majority could transfer in order to get into a desegregated school to which Dr. Burkhart replied that he didn't think so that it had not been the administrative practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.390" offset="16592959">One must recall that these items of testimony appearing in this record were taken in 1960, which was early in the testing of the ability of the Knoxville system to receive this disregard of the color line which it is now become accustomed to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.828" offset="16682715">I think that in the light of Mr. (Inaudible) testimony that it can be safely said that if no particular disturbance in the school to which such a Negro would be transferred is to be anticipated by reason of that, there is no reason why his request should not be granted, particularly if there is any metal -- mental stress or unhappiness on the part of the child's parents as being denied, desegregation in the school of his own.</text>

            <text syncTime="4207.574" offset="16933700">I will say this that wherever that there was any necessity of communicating particular notices to the public, the newspaper has been freely used and I don't think there's ever been any announcement of that but there have been tests of all kinds, attempt to probe into the system to see whether this could be done and that could be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="4260.657" offset="17146023">It maybe already a desegregated school and no question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.246" offset="17168384">The transfer grounds are granted and have been for years and years and years as a matter of convenience for reasons which perhaps comparatively trivial.</text>

            <text syncTime="4674.188" offset="18800097">And in that connection, I would like to proceed to a point that is relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.612" offset="18833847">And that is what was said in argument yesterday about the position of the Knoxville School Board, our position being represented as that even if this transfer ground is struck out of the plan and we're going to do it anyhow.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.773" offset="18902497">Now, the brief filed on behalf of the school board in the City of Knoxville asserted that if the grounds are knocked out of this plan, that nevertheless Knoxville did not feel that it should blind itself to the educational disadvantages of any pupil in the public school.</text>
            <text syncTime="4721.899" offset="18991000">And if it should find cases of pupils who are under pressure, under persecution or under handicapped by a reason even if it stems from racial origins or racial facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="4737.711" offset="19054216">The school board felt that it would be its duty to transfer that child upon appropriate application when it appeared to be in the interest of the child's education.</text>
            <text syncTime="4749.408" offset="19101027">Now, this statement which comes from me that we intended to go ahead anyhow as if in violation of the Supreme Court's holding or treatment of this plan indicates how far their application to the story of this plan goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4767.957" offset="19175215">It goes to this point of compelling and coercing these minority pupils to stay in schools where they don't belong, where they're unhappy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4780.631" offset="19225893">If they're Negroes where they may be subjected to the customary epithets and names and if they're white they may be called poor white trash and all that business, thereby, destroying that opportunity which is the duty of the school board to provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.916" offset="19311052">Now, we think that in the consideration of the constitutionality of this matter that the fact that you're building into or engrafting into the school system a core of improperly treated pupils against the wish of the parents and the welfare, the pupils themselves is to create something which may lead to the ultimate collapse of the whole thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4830.951" offset="19427140">But one thing, there are economic consequences which may follow as exodus of whites by selling their residences and that has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.007" offset="19471444">And it's a reasonable thing for a white person to do in our community and particularly in other communities of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="4851.702" offset="19510209">The white people can transfer their children to private schools, so that one becomes aware of the fact that there are consequences going beyond the mere distribution of the case of a particular pupil.</text>
            <text syncTime="4868.969" offset="19579277">And on top of that, the impact of this business is not going to be on the white minorities, because by reason of a little bit better affluence, they can avoid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4881.437" offset="19629119">The impact is going to be upon the Negro minorities, who can't move at and can't send their children to private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="4891.975" offset="19671228">So they will be the ones whose -- who are in effect confined to places that they would rather be at out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4902.578" offset="19713651">So, on that score we feel that such consideration is irrelevant on the part -- on the point of consideration of constitutionality which to my mind being almost completely uninformed on the gradations and the new answers of these questions that have been put and pays back and forth largely consists not in determining whether this is a matter of state action entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="4937.244" offset="19852309">But whether do you get down to the wis -- the point of is it a wise action?</text>
            <text syncTime="4942.684" offset="19874147">Is it wise to leave an educational system with a sickness?</text>

            <text syncTime="5448.334" offset="21896756">That this is being tried completely and virtually completely without a reference and one reason it is being less tried one reason why he left out of this record here is a considerable portion of the testimony which sustain the adoption of the step of the one grade a year plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="5469.300" offset="21980557">That is we sustain a reasonableness of slowing down the process of desegregation is that the petition for writ of certiorari in this case raise only the point of constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="5481.692" offset="22030190">There was no denial of proof of the existence of adequate proof to sustain a reasonable slowing down of the transition to desegregation as had been suggested by the Supreme Court as wise measures in the places where it was violated tradition and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="5503.026" offset="22115453">And consequently, the Knoxville Board did act as a transition matter in adopting this whole plan which is composed of various consistently fitting together pieces including the step bar -- the grade by year plan coupled with the transfer plan all of them operating these limitations, adopted after deliberation as reasonable procedures to assure the undisturbed and efficient and effective success of the compliance to the Supreme Court's order.</text>

            <text syncTime="5713.737" offset="22958268">I wasn't thinking about the constitutional validity of this plan at that State to begin, but it may well be true that the racial ground alone without any particular prejudice but the naked ground of race is an adequate ground for transfer on the theory that it -- a good thing to have in the balancing of interest and the encouragement of individual thinking even if it amounts to individual discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="6176.383" offset="24808887">This case is important to Memphis because in our school system, approximately 50% of some 47 different units of our school's grades one through nine or what we termed open schools and a person can transfer to an open school regardless of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="6204.562" offset="24921631">There is no need for reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="6222.024" offset="24991431">I should hasten to point out, however, that under the Memphis plan, which is an appendix in the brief, the Board will grant a transfer and intends to grant transfers in the future where there is a reasonable educational need to a Negro child even though that child's grade is not covered by the plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="6544.317" offset="26280626">The state action has created a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6547.422" offset="26293060">It has assigned a child, who is in the minority to a given school.</text>
            <text syncTime="6554.602" offset="26321795">Now, there's no question that the problem exist with respect to that minority child.</text>
            <text syncTime="6560.565" offset="26345618">The petitioners acknowledged the existence of the problem in some instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="6565.101" offset="26363800">In some instances there is no problem but we are only concerned with those problem cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="6572.381" offset="26392848">The Solicitor General recognizes that a problem exists and they offer a certain solutions for the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6580.292" offset="26424508">I there -- I suggest that the solutions which they offer do not meet the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="6586.958" offset="26451153">They would have you believe that this is a plan which is solely designed to retard the desegregation of the school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="6598.044" offset="26495561">That it will retard it by permitting the white minority child to escape from the Negro school.</text>
            <text syncTime="6605.244" offset="26524400">I respectfully suggest, if the Court please, that the direct converse is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="6611.246" offset="26548328">Let us assume the situation where we have no provision such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6617.101" offset="26571734">And let us assume that a white parent is assigned or a white student is assigned as a minority in a predominantly Negro school.</text>
            <text syncTime="6628.017" offset="26615411">The parent goes to the school board and asked for a transfer, and now he is not sophisticated enough to give us the magic word, he says, “I want to transfer because of race.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6638.361" offset="26656789">We say, “No, you've given us that reason, we can't grant the transfer.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6643.367" offset="26676851">It then becomes a race between the truant officer and the real estate agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="6649.401" offset="26700988">I suggest to the Court that the most casual glimpse of most urban communities reflects that those white parents, who are economically affluent, will simply move to the suburban areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="6667.676" offset="26774026">So the Board of Education has no real problem with a white parent, with a white minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="6674.540" offset="26801507">They simply flee to suburbia and there we are.</text>
            <text syncTime="6679.608" offset="26821778">The Board is not going to be bothered with this white minority child.</text>
            <text syncTime="6684.149" offset="26839960">Where the difficulty is going to come is in this less economically affluent group.</text>
            <text syncTime="6691.731" offset="26870262">In most instances, the Negro child, who is caught in an educational environment that his parents recognize was -- is not best suited for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="6702.948" offset="26915192">So this parent comes to the school board and says, “I want to transfer,” and that parent is not sophisticated either.</text>
            <text syncTime="6710.180" offset="26944136">It doesn't know the magic words, it says race.</text>
            <text syncTime="6713.554" offset="26957615">And we are caught, we can't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6717.214" offset="26972244">I suggest to the Court that it's this group; it's the economic unaffluent group who are going to be punished by the absence of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6730.546" offset="27025533">It's this group that perhaps the people on this side of the table should represent more than I.</text>
            <text syncTime="6737.848" offset="27054791">But it's this group who are going to be hurt by a provision or the absence of such a provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6747.181" offset="27092093">I suggest to the Court that these minorities, the Negro or the poor white minority are going to be made to swallow their constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="6759.779" offset="27142457">That's -- it's going to be pushed down their throat by state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="6764.666" offset="27161997">State action first created this problem -- excuse me, if the Court please, it seems my time is up.</text>

            <text syncTime="7019.674" offset="28182026">Let's say at the lunch room at lunch time that there might be some level of students of the -- who are Negroes there, who don't want to eat lunch with the white students who -- is the school compelled by the Constitution to make them, to make them intermixed?</text>

            <text syncTime="7038.375" offset="28256841">No, no, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="7039.887" offset="28262902">The -- the school is -- the school system is merely compelled not to impose any racial distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="7044.908" offset="28282964">Now, if in the unique case of Baltimore for example, which other systems for obvious reasons find difficult to adopt, where people go to school completely as a matter of their own choice, that's one thing but everywhere else where there are standards for attending school and assigning the teachers and so forth, this must be done without regard to race.</text>
            <text syncTime="7068.038" offset="28375542">Now, this has been a subject of a great deal of litigation in the Courts of Appeals in pupil assignment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="7072.855" offset="28394768">Pupil assignment cases arise out of children being assigned to school on the basis of race and then given an opportunity to transfer presumably without regard to race.</text>
            <text syncTime="7082.348" offset="28432802">After a great deal of litigation, the Courts of Appeals are all in unanimous agreement, the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits, appear to agree that the right of the child is the right to attend a system without regard to race and therefore as in the Holland Case in Florida in the Fifth Circuit, a Negro child who lives close to a Negro school which if it were to be desegregated, the system were to be desegregated would still be a school entirely composed of Negro students.</text>
            <text syncTime="7111.044" offset="28547532">And would be the school he would attend because it's near him, has a right to bring a suit to desegregate the system because his right is not to attend a particular structure or to be in company with any particular students but to go to school in a system that has no racial considerations or distinctions attached to any of the various phases of its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7131.211" offset="28628198">And I could cite the cases in our -- in our brief but --</text>

            <text syncTime="7133.560" offset="28637602">But your board isn't or is it in your view constitutionally compelled to gerrymander its -- its -- its school system in order to assure integrated school?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack Greenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="7144.211" offset="28680234">No, that is not what we're urging and that is not our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="7149.590" offset="28701759">Our view is that in no racial distinctions in the system and as I say it has come up in pupil assignment cases which you are sort of the adverse of this, but all of the Circuits in the cases of the Wheeler and Jeffer's case in the Fourth Circuit, most recently an unreported case in the Fifth, Potts versus Flax.</text>
            <text syncTime="7167.285" offset="28772498">In the Sixth Circuit, the North Worth's case and in the Eighth Circuit the Little Rock in Delaware School cases, all unanimously agree with this view.</text>
            <text syncTime="7174.831" offset="28802696">And consequently a transfer system which had a racial standard as a part of it is a violation of that teaching of Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="7185.541" offset="28845537">Now, there was -- I perhaps didn't make myself clear yesterday, though I think our view on the right of the individual child who may be disturbed but whose education may be affected by attending a particular school.</text>
            <text syncTime="7198.811" offset="28898617">The question that Mr. Justice Brennan among others ask, I believe, our view on that is clearly expressed in our reply brief, where we discussed that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="7207.441" offset="28933099">And our view on that is that no child should be permitted to transfer because of a racial desire, because of a desire not to go to school with members of another race.</text>
            <text syncTime="7220.182" offset="28984090">The school board cannot recognize that under a matter of practice or under explicit terms of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="7227.434" offset="29013138">And -- but however, if a child had clinical problems or educational problems because of such a situation we would be punitive about it and insist that that particular disturbed child must stay in that situation, whether it's good for him or not, that of course is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="7246.368" offset="29088893">We don't face that problem here at this time but in recognizing that such exceptional circumstances might be proper grounds for a transfer, we respectfully submit that such a rule if it were to be discussed in opinion, should not open the door to evasion with such a rule possibly might do.</text>
            <text syncTime="7271.906" offset="29190980">Because as -- as the Knoxville -- Knoxville brief has indicated and his argument here today has indicated, it is quite easy as a matter of course to merely assume that this situation exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="7287.044" offset="29251584">And to freely allow transfers on what purports to be an individual clinical evaluation than what is merely a racial standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="7297.400" offset="29292962">And we would submit that all other reasonable avenues of exhausting the situation of solving the problem, first, should be exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="7304.496" offset="29321383">And that the burden of proof in such a case should be a heavy one, but nevertheless, certainly in the last analysis no one would insist that a child be compelled to attend the school if it were to be quite clear detriment of his education.</text>
