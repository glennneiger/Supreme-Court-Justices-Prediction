          <turn speaker="peyton_ford" startTime="0.000" stopTime="320.435">
            <label>Mr. Peyton Ford</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">If the Court please, I would like to briefly refer outside of the mainstream of my argument to several matters that Mr. Ogden raised yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.766" offset="234454">One is, the transfer of the case from Judge Wallis to Judge Chandler.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.976" offset="267264">On page 81 of the record, there's a letter from Judge Wallis to the clerk of the United States District Court, where he says to the clerk, “at the request of Mr. John Ogden, one of the attorneys for Mr. Simler, in the above styled case, I am assigning this case to the Honorable Steven S. Chandler for trial and disposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.482" offset="369351">In connection with Mr. Ogden's further argument as to the reasonable fee and so forth, in his deposition at 105 of the -- 106, I guess in -- of the record, he asked this question, “Alright sir, then did you know when you employed Mr. Conner, what a reasonable fee was or wasn't a reasonable fee?</text>
            <text syncTime="100.614" offset="505814">You put in there a reasonable fee to be fixed by the Court?”</text>
            <text syncTime="104.418" offset="521070">“No, but I trust him in the cost in there that we would if we couldn't agree on a reasonable fee, it'd be left up to the County Court, the court, Mr. Simler or any other court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="118.324" offset="576658">As to the question of federal law controlling and whether the respondent was or wasn't in agreement or disagreement with it on the prior proceedings, in fact, the position was never contested one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.825" offset="674670">The Court sent this case back to the Tenth Circuit as I read their ruling for the Tenth Circuit to decide whether state law required a jury trial or non-jury trial and the Tenth Circuit in obedience to this Court's direction held that it was a non-jury trial, citing the Southard case in which they specifically held, overruled the Haunstein case that Mr. Ogden was citing at the conclusion of his argument yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.836" offset="850735">However, the respondent in this case does not argue that the federal law isn't applicable under Rule 56 in an action for finding a promotion for summary judgment in portion and motion for summary judgment it makes no difference whether it's a jury trial or a non-jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.514" offset="977377">Now, as I concluded yesterday, I pointed out that under the action for -- under the motion for summary judgment that the petitioner clearly agreed on the terms of the September agreement, the execution of it, the full performance by -- of the contract by the petitioner and that the litigation was taken to both the Supreme Court of Oklahoma and the Supreme Court of United States to this Court and as the result of his efforts they recovered this 160-acre farm which is of great value.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.214" offset="1148217">As to the motion for summary judgment granted below, the Court held three very extensive hearings on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.029" offset="1175489">Affidavits were filed, depositions were taken from all parties present at the signing of the September agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.568" offset="1217599">In petitioner's counterclaim, he asked that the September agreement be set aside because he'd been overreached.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.883" offset="1250931">In support of this position, he basically alleged only three things: one, his age which is 74; two, his inexperience in litigation and three, the fact that he just doesn't want to be bound by the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.175" offset="1328044">Some subjective state of mind he said occurred at the time the agreement was signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.280" offset="1352495">Well, of course that can't vary the terms of unambiguous written agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.435" offset="1385096">The petitioner's position now if this wasn't an agreement at all based on the famous race -- racehorse jockey doctrine, whatever is the race?</text>

            <text syncTime="395.713" offset="1686235">And the first -- I think the most important consideration is that for now being upon assumption that internal Oklahoma law, this is at page 7 of my brief, affirmatively the outlaws, attorney fees, contracts are more than reasonable notwithstanding that they are prescribed in an otherwise lawful contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.372" offset="1776828">Such an assumption is nowhere asserted to prove by the petitioner either below or in the -- or in his brief before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.807" offset="1810578">At any event, the recent decision of Southard makes it plain that such assumption is not the substantive law of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.451" offset="1845164">The only precedent respondent cites is Holstein which I said has been overruled but in the subsequent case, the Oklahoma Court stated and I'm quoting, “Since we hold that the deed and the attorney client contract are binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.733" offset="1906291">There is no necessity to discuss the value of the services on quantum meruit.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1549.482" offset="6301341">In that case, the Court held that where legal and equitable claims have joined, it's improper to try the equitable claim by the Court ahead of the issues triable and the jury for this might incur of the litigants' right to a jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.021" offset="6367483">I think the answer to that has two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.870" offset="6382843">The first is that the Beacon doctrine affects only those cases where there's an issue of fact common to the legal and equitable claims and that isn't true in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.249" offset="6432371">The question about the reasonable attorney fee here has nothing whatever to do with the question of whether the September instrument was fraudulently induced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.698" offset="6474167">And furthermore, the reasonable fee claim is a contingent claim, that is it's not an -- it's not an alternative to the cancellation of the contract, that is the reasonable fee claim is contingent upon the cancellation of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.159" offset="6552012">It's a claim that can arise only after it's been decided that the September instrument was to be set aside and Beacon doesn't reach that question on purely contingent claims and in that, I call your attention to the case of Damsky v. [Inaudible] cited on page -- its 289 F.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.332" offset="6672697">That's same case that I cited in connection with historical construction of Seventh Amendment decided by Judge Friendly in the Second Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1663.307" offset="6756603">Yes sir, within the ambit of the given factual situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.685" offset="6934131">I would like to read briefly from a colloquy between the Court and Mr. Ogden that was referenced to 102 of the transcript where the Court is doing its best to get Mr. Ogden to tell him what other evidence he has to offer except the affidavits and depositions filed in connection with the motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.868" offset="7050846">The court says, what additional testimony, I don't want to know what it is, but what point would you offer it to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.424" offset="7077073">Well, if Your Honor please, we would offer just for the reasonableness of the fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.094" offset="7095777">That is one thing we would do because we think that would be proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.984" offset="7107271">Next, Your Honor, Mr. Simler has testified he doesn't desire to change his testimony but we do desire to corroborate it with other testimony which we have at the time of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.209" offset="7152201">Now, could there be any other testimony on this point?</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.040" offset="7163486">Well, Mr. Conner and Mr. Simler are in complete disagreement on what took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.605" offset="7181772">There were only two of them who were there but if the Court please I'm not saying, “Well, there are other people there both charged whose testimony you're going to rely upon or add to it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.246" offset="7220328">Well, I think I'm going to rely upon Mr. Arnold Britten who was a third person present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.300" offset="7240600">Mr. Britten sued Mr. Simler for attorney fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.539" offset="7253556">You're going to use Mr. Britten now, what are you going to prove by Mr. Ogden Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.930" offset="7279052">I've got his deposition as I recall it, he testified in that deposition I don't attempt to remember the details, but as I recall he testified, it was after this county court case which is October 2 that Mr. Grigsby got up the idea to file a suit in a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.507" offset="7337357">Mr. Conner had nothing to with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.264" offset="7348433">Are you willing for that to be part of the record, Mr. Bailey who was representing Mr. Conner then, we're willing to stipulate that the deposition be filed in this case; his affidavit as to his testimony is also on file.</text>

            <text syncTime="1886.943" offset="7651140">Mr. Ogden: Well, I have getting up here and talk to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.802" offset="7666604">The Court: I thought you came here for pretrial and then it goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.026" offset="7683427">But it's clear all the depositions, all the affidavits before the Court and although the colloquy isn't as clear as it might be it's also clear that one of the evident -- other evidence that could be produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.849" offset="7734732">And I make that argument in support of the motion granted to sustain the summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.042" offset="7775587">And in the pleadings their only conclusions pled, they're not our ultimate facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.359" offset="7804844">There are no facts alleged as to fraud of any appreciable nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.043" offset="7831594">There's only one other factual situation I would want to mention that Mr. Ogden yesterday did mention that Mr. Conner had Mr. Simler up there for the purpose of signing a will in September 1952 when this latter agreement presented into by Mr. Simler's deposition that is lodged in the clerk's office on page 30.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.483" offset="7925321">That will was entered into in September 1953 not September 1952.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.981" offset="7951339">Now, in conclusion, if I can reach after briefly it's the respondent's position: one, that in a federal diversity action at summary judgment is a perfectly proper method of procedure even though the countervailing practice doesn't prevail in the foreign state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.933" offset="8059068">Two, that under summary judgment action it makes no deference whether the case is triable to a jury or not to a jury; three, that the court acted properly in granting the summary judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2243.897" offset="9078993">If Your Honor please may I just state this, I really wish I had time to make -- might have to [Inaudible] I just don't feel like to justify with the short time I have left to tell the Court the -- here, you asked about the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.736" offset="9126327">Well, all there was to it, Mrs. Fletcher died and she gave different people different amounts of money and her brother a dollar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.838" offset="9162689">Now, the Supreme Court of Oklahoma upheld that will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.711" offset="9174183">The County Court upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.027" offset="9179512">The suit the County Court, I mean the petition to probate the will was disposed off on October 2nd, 1952 about seven days after this letter was signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.749" offset="9222353">Of course when the letter was signed, nobody knew what the County Court would hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.002" offset="9235414">That's the first trial that was ever held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.059" offset="9243564">Then they appealed the District Court before Judge Mills, the District Judge and he upheld the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.964" offset="9267179">Then they appealed to Supreme Court and the Supreme Court upheld the will of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.763" offset="9286405">So, then everything except this farm went to the people as a will to, Mr. Simler got nothing with that which was substantial, I would say more than a $100,000 in cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.997" offset="9331336">Now, then Mr. Grigsby who had a 28% contract with Mr. Conner, said, “I will get 28% of your fee in writing.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.804" offset="9370624">He conceived the idea and filed this suit in a federal court saying this corporation couldn't take because it was a corporation and this farm was necessary for its operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.710" offset="9414196">Now, the judge, in Oklahoma City, Judge Wallis sustained the motion for summary judgment and then Mr. Grigsby for Mr. Simler appealed and went to Denver and argued the case before the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals said in 210 F.2d at page 99 that this con -- this corporation is utterly forbidden to take this property because the Constitution of Oklahoma won't let it take it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.027" offset="9511476">So, then you have 160 acres over here with unwilled property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.480" offset="9549302">Well, of course where they said in that opinion that property belongs to Mr. Simler because he is the next -- he's the only heir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.940" offset="9579081">So, that's the way that came about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.855" offset="9586813">Now, if the Court please, that case was certiorari -- certiorari was denied in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2378.186" offset="9616071">Now, in this case here, if the Court please, I want to call the Court's attention to the fact that suppose they instead of arguing this matter that we would be arguing, are trying the case and I'd called Mr. Simler and say, “Now, Mr. Simler how old are you?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.152" offset="9708022">He said, “Have you ever been in court?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.106" offset="9715754">“No, never been in court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.100" offset="9719724">Do you know anything about lawyer's fees?</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.456" offset="9725158">“No sir.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.199" offset="9732159">Then I want you to tell the court and jury what a reasonable fee is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.967" offset="9747205">They say, “Well, we object that if the Court please he is not competent to tell what a reasonable fee is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.219" offset="9768208">The court sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.026" offset="9779493">Now, the next thing if the Court please, if the Court will read the Haunstein case which contrary and I must engage with counsel has never been overruled by any court at any time anywhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.049" offset="9847620">I have the Haunstein case here and as I quoted yesterday from that this contract, this second letter, it's not even a contract, is absolutely utterly, presumptively fraudulent, that's what that said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.367" offset="9904880">That was the same kind of a case between a lawyer to client in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.953" offset="9927137">So since that was presumptively fraudulent, then the Court said even the burden is on the lawyer then to prove that that second letter was fair, just and reasonable and even then, yes, the very wording of the Supreme Court, he is not entitled to more than a reasonable fee regardless of the contract price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.543" offset="10017520">So it wouldn't make a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.951" offset="10023163">See if the Court please, there is a great distinction when a lawyer -- a client comes in my office I can make any kind of contract with him, I want to do, but after he becomes my client, the law forbids that I make any contract with him except one that is fair and reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.515" offset="10093484">I can't change it up because I have too much advantage of him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.140" offset="10103933">He wouldn't come to me unless he had faith in me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.463" offset="10113233">Now, if the Court please this common law matters, I will call at your attention and may I say it before I forget, I have the briefs here from the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in the Southard versus MacDonald case and I have told the Court on what they contend there just a suit to cancel the deed had nothing to with the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.675" offset="10190033">There's no deed and that contract in Southard versus MacDonald was made at the inception of the -- they made a contract, it says it will give you 40%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.640" offset="10233919">Then when they got through the case, the lawyer said, “Give me a deed, you said you'd give me 40%, you said alright.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.850" offset="10254817">That's contract beginning of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.855" offset="10262758">They made him a deed then four years, seven months and 10 days later, those people sought to cancel that deed that they gave their lawyer four years before a fellow lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.697" offset="10298180">And so it has no connection in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.443" offset="10309151">Now, if the Court please, this common law case that he referred to in his brief I want to read that to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.987" offset="10339349">That was in 1693, it's only eight from 10 lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.413" offset="10353037">It'll take just a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.554" offset="10361605">It says, I can't hardly read because that old pen, penny here but I got it anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.194" offset="10384175">The plaintiff being a counselor at law brought a bill for fees due to him from the defendant being a solicitor and was to account with him at the end of every term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.514" offset="10425448">The defendant demurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.955" offset="10431195">This Court allowed demurer some kind of words I can't understand, demurrer affirmed and the bill dismissed, that's the common law actually that he referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.910" offset="10474977">In 1693, 98 years before the Constitution was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.787" offset="10490546">The next one he refers too, I also have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.781" offset="10498487">I'd like to read it to you, just a line from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.108" offset="10515832">We do not find any difference in the Middle Ages both a like that sue for their fees but it was laid down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.317" offset="10548642">In 1629, 1630 that a barrister unlike an attorney could not sue for his fees but in this case, this is an attorney contract so of course that wouldn't have anything to do with it as I view it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.691" offset="10594095">Now, if the Court please, I really think that I should in fairness to Mr. Simler and I just didn't have time see these parties took additional time to file a brief, 30 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.717" offset="10646235">Then when I got their brief and then of course I'm just a fair, ordinary lawyer and -- around in a different place but this happened to be pretty busy time of the year for me and consequently I didn't have time to get up a reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.405" offset="10688972">I thought I should but I did make some notes which I would like to call to the Court's attention now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.549" offset="10717602">Now, if the Court please, Colorado, the Supreme Court of Colorado said in a case here very similar to this, all of these that I'm going to call your attention are cases where the lawyer made a contract with his client after the relationship begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.583" offset="10785729">Now, in Rough versus Cool, 362 Pacific Second, 396, The Supreme Court of Colorado used this language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.897" offset="10838915">Now, could I just get that all here?</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.351" offset="10856782">I hate getting heard because when I do it kind of bothers me and I'm not much have the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.947" offset="10883114">Here's what the Supreme Court said, “Once the confidential relationship the attorney and client exists the law governing contracts entered into them is very different, entered in to about him is very different.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.968" offset="10927208">The test applied to such contracts when the attorney seeks to enforce the same is well stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.937" offset="10959078">7CGS attorney and client, Section 204; when -- where after a relationship had -- this is CGS, I'm reading from, Wallis from the opinion of the Court but that Court didn't see this, where after a relationship has been established the attorney and client entered into an agreement in reference to the attorney's compensation, the burdens of whom the attorney to prove that the agreement was fairly and [Inaudible] was supported by an adequate consideration that he gave a client full knowledge of the facts of his legal rights when he entered into the agreement and that service to be performed were reasonably worth the amount stated in the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.617" offset="11117798">And then concluding it says, upon demand and action for the recovery specific real of personal property with or without them just or for a money claim to do on a contact of damages to breach the contract must be tried by a jury unless the jury is waived, that's Colorado speaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.482" offset="11197315">Now, if the Court please, as I told the Court, the Supreme Court of California held in a case that where they passed the law and California said the lawyer, if he withdraws, the judge would fix fee and they have this unconstitutional, they violated the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.570" offset="11261680">Now, then if the Court please, citing CGS again 50CGS 77874 where there is a dispute over terms of an agreement as to the fee to be paid, also where it is provided a statute that an acts for damages is claimed if successful may recover reasonable fee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.538" offset="11337540">The amount of such fee must be determined by a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.202" offset="11356139">Now, if the Court please I just won't read from these because I haven't got the time.</text>
