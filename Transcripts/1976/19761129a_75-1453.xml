            <text syncTime="72.238" offset="393362">I appear on behalf of the Chief of Police of Lebanon, New Hampshire, the Director of the New Hampshire State Police and the Commissioner of the New Hampshire Department of Motor Vehicles, all three of whom are the appellants herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.455" offset="470267">This case presents to this Court two general issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.728" offset="491269">The first, dealing with symbolic speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.022" offset="504435">The issue being whether consistent with the First and Fourteenth Amendments, the State of New Hampshire may prohibit by criminal sanction the knowing obscuration of the State motto, “Live Free or Die” on the license plates of registrants of motor vehicles in New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.077" offset="588654">The second issue is whether or not the appellees herein prior to the utilization of the United States District Court for the Federal District of New Hampshire were obligated or should have exhausted their State appellate remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.905" offset="679978">In 1809, General John Stark of New Hampshire wrote a letter to his Vermont comrades declining for reasons of health to attend the 32nd reunion of the 1777 Battle of Bennington, Vermont in which General Stark had commanded the Continental troops against a decisive victory against the British and Germans.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.819" offset="803694">At the conclusion of his letter, General Stark wrote to his comrades a proposed toast for the reunion.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.141" offset="848938">The proposed toast was “Live Free or Die, death is not the worst of evils.”</text>
            <text syncTime="195.228" offset="885300">The toast obviously was reminiscent of the words of Patrick Henry back in 1775, “But as for me, give me liberty, or give me death.”</text>
            <text syncTime="206.000" offset="928350">168 years after the Battle of Bennington, Vermont, the New Hampshire General Court or legislature adapted the words, “Life Free or Die” as the official State motto of the State of New Hampshire, 168 years after those words were said.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.256" offset="1029392">In 1969, our legislature directed the Director of the Division of Motor Vehicles to place on all passenger vehicles registered in New Hampshire the State motto, “Live Free or Die.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2378.934" offset="9620125">There are Federal Courts that have applied it to questions of law.</text>

            <text syncTime="2395.228" offset="9685326">As I note in my brief, there’s a question as to whether Judge Bownes should have denied that particular motion the way he did, but the fact of the matter is that the State abandoned it and the only time they’ve mentioned it since is in its brief and not as jurisdictional statement that was filed to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.427" offset="9746139">And I would again ask that if the Court feels that that issue should be reached in this case that we should be able to brief it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.498" offset="9794414">There’s an additional question which the State sort of combined with its Younger argument, but which we feel is a separate question and that goes to the permanent injunctive relief that the District Court entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.737" offset="9855331">Again, this is an issue we feel the State has waived and the District Court said that the State did not dispute it, that the Federal Court could issue an injunctive relief against threatened arrest and prosecutions and that’s what they did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.275" offset="9909457">I would want to point out that there were no prosecutors or judges as defendants in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.904" offset="9932027">The reason we asked for an injunction against arrest and prosecution is in New Hampshire, frequently, police officers initiate prosecutions in District Court and the injunction that the Court issued only runs to those individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.181" offset="9993153">This was an extremely narrow injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.265" offset="10009454">It was nothing like the injunction that was issued in Rickshaw v. Good which involved the internal workings of a police department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.669" offset="10039024">All this injunction directed was that Maynards not to be arrested or prosecuted for the offense of taping over the motto on their license plates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.602" offset="10094822">The State has briefed another issue with respect to Mrs. Maynard and they’ve argued that her action be dismissed based on some language in Doran v. Salem Inn that she and her husband were so closely intertwined that if he is barred by Younger then she must be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.489" offset="10162322">The common law, a husband and wife are one and the husband was the one, but that is no longer the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.598" offset="10186773">Mrs. Maynard’s action was not a subterfuge to circumvent Younger considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.687" offset="10215194">She had standing on her own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.007" offset="10220419">She was threatened with prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.623" offset="10226897">She shares her husband’s religious beliefs and there’s no question but that she had Article 3 standing and we would argue that irrespective of whether Younger governs Mr. Maynard’s case, Mrs. Maynard must proceed to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.686" offset="10299099">Central question in this case is whether the action of the Maynards in placing reflective tape over the State motto on their license plates is protected by the First Amendment as symbolic expression and whether the State’s interests are substantial enough to override that expression.</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.063" offset="12140628">They’ve selected a message which they want to project, they select a billboard as it will appear on all non-commercial license plates in State and then they make it a criminal offense to cover that over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.676" offset="12211054">So, it’s not unrelated to the suppression of expression and unless the State can come up with some compelling need or unless they can show a clear and present danger that their interest cannot be served otherwise then that is not a valid justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.490" offset="12282316">The other interest they advanced is that it helps their system of motor vehicle registration, but the motto is nonfunctional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.357" offset="12309797">It does not serve any purpose on the license plate unlike the numbers or the name of the State or the date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.754" offset="12339367">And it’s our position that the State lacks the power to require its citizens to bear this sort of motto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3066.321" offset="12369669">And as the Chief Justice was asking before, I think that if the Court were to uphold this sort of thing, then the State could require all citizens to wear a pin or an armband or they could require you to have a plat on your door next your address saying “Live Free or Die.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.656" offset="12439050">I’m sorry.</text>

            <text syncTime="3089.248" offset="12461411">And beyond that, there’s evidence in the record that, at least with regard to the Maynard’s plate, there’s no duplicate plate in the State of New Hampshire, so it would not present any problem of identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.617" offset="12506864">This is not an O’Brien case as my brother counsel said before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.905" offset="12524001">O’Brien involved the war power, one of the most pervasive powers that you could imagine under our system of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.600" offset="12554825">Also, O’Brien destroyed and mutilated his draft card.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.798" offset="12567573">That was the whole point of the exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.576" offset="12578649">Mr. Maynard is not destroying the plate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3344.239" offset="13481336">Very briefly Mr. Chief Justice and Justices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.306" offset="13501607">During my direct remarks, I was inquired as to whether the State of New Hampshire is before this Court seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.535" offset="13530551">We are here seriously.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.542" offset="13546538">There are many mottos which we have in this country and I think this is an important case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.714" offset="13583214">“In God We Trust” is upon our coins and currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.564" offset="13598678">“E Pluribus Unum” is upon our coins and currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.571" offset="13614665">“Equal Justice under Law” is upon the edifice in which we appear today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.986" offset="13644340">I think there is something to be said for the preservation of certain slogans and mottos.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.914" offset="13672030">Next, I would point out that we lawyers are required to be members of bar associations in many states and yet by that requirement, it is not implicit that we agree with what the bar association in each State says or stands for.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.686" offset="13751129">When we place postage stamps on our envelopes, those postage stamps contain symbols and mottos.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.068" offset="13784670">“Liberty depends on Freedom of the Press” issued November 13, 1975 by the United States Government and I’m not sure whether every member of the judiciary necessarily would believe in that particular motto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.249">And certainly, if a member of the judiciary were to place a stamp bearing that motto, “Liberty Depends on Freedom of the Press” upon a letter, no one reasonably would believe that he necessarily concurs with the sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3471.210">I think it’s important in this case also that the defendant mutilated the license plates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.441">He cut out the words.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.299">And I think finally, it’s important that there was no particular message enunciated by the conduct of the appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.351">The District Court found that by his conduct, he expressed a particular message, a message which indicated his objections.</text>
