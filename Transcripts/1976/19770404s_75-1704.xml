            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100532">The judgment and opinion of the Court in Number 75-1704, Alexander, the Secretary of the Army against Fioto will be announced by Mr. Justice Stevens.</text>

            <text syncTime="12.617" offset="150896">In this case, the Secretary of the Army has appealed directly to this Court from an adverse judgement entered by a three-judge District Court sitting in the Eastern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.568" offset="190707">After World War II, Congress authorized retirement pay for non-regular military personnel with at least 20 years of service in the Reserves or National Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.784" offset="227592">However, those who had been in the Reserves before World War II were not eligible for benefits unless they perform service, performed active duty during war time.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.283" offset="265626">Appellee is such a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.466" offset="274299">He contends that he may not be denied benefits for which he is otherwise eligible, simply because he had pre-war service.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.906" offset="304078">In the District Court, he argued that the statute violates the equal protection principle inherent in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.427" offset="334171">In this Court, he makes the additional argument that the statute should be construed as merely providing that his years of pre-war service must be ignored for the purpose of determining his eligibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.326" offset="377743">For reasons stated in an opinion filed with the clerk, we reject both arguments and unanimously reverse the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.851" offset="407836">Mr. Justice Rehnquist took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
