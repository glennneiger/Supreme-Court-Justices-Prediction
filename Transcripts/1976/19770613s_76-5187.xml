            <text syncTime="10.400" offset="142121">The petitioner in this case was a child of stealing two wallets from the blind operator of a newsstand in the lobby of the United States Post Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.231" offset="185380">During his first trial, the District Court granted petitioner's motion to dismiss on the ground that the indictment had failed to specify accurately the crime charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.452" offset="234281">Petitioner was retried and convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.226" offset="245357">His conviction was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.697" offset="263225">We granted certiorari to consider whether the petition of second trial violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.310" offset="297706">We hold that it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.429" offset="306170">We think the principles explained in our decision in the last term in the United States against Dinitz are applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.623" offset="338980">As the dismissal was granted at petitioner's request without judicial or prosecutorial overreaching and on -- and on the ground consistent with retrial, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bought re-prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.863" offset="407943">Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Rehnquist have filed separate concurring opinions.</text>
