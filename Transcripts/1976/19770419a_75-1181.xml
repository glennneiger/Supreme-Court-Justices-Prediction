            <label>Mr. Joel J. Rabin</label>
            <text syncTime="58.967" offset="336363">Thank you, Mister Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.937" offset="344200">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.415" offset="354127">This litigation began only six years ago and it has been before the court on two previous occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.200" offset="377323">Despite its complex course through the Federal Judicial system, there is only one clear cut issue, now facing the court this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.726" offset="407417">And, that is whether the present version of the regulation of the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare, 45 CFR, 233-100A1 is valid under the grant of rule making authority containing Section 407A of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.635" offset="475021">So, what we are arguing today is an Administrative Law case.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.728" offset="487351">One concerning the proper scope of agency rule making.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.792" offset="503652">By its petition for certiorari, Maryland seeks reversal of an order by a Three-Judge District Court, affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuits denying Maryland’s motion to vacate an injunction previously entered by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.777" offset="559554">That denial was based on holding that the HW regulation was invalid under Section 407A.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.584" offset="594767">Before stating the facts, it might be helpful to briefly outline the statutory framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.469" offset="618381">The AFDC-UF Program, unlike the regular AFDC Program, authorizes benefits to two parent households, where the need or deprivation of the children in the family arise from the unemployment of the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.246" offset="673448">Program was first enacted in 1961 as the Unemployed Parent Program and covered need or deprivation arising from the unemployment of either parent.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.848" offset="707825">In its original form Section 407, provided for coverage of children, who are needy as a result of the unemployment of a parent “As define by the State.”</text>
            <text syncTime="163.851" offset="755890">In 1968, substantial amendments were made in program and the language of Section 407 was changed from unemployment as defined by the State to “Unemployment” as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.709" offset="823286">After passage of these amendments, HEW prescribed the predecessor version of 233-100A1, which mandated an hours work criterion for State definitions of unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.586" offset="874799">All persons who work less than 30 hours per week.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.797" offset="891622">The regulation also permitted coverage per persons who work up to 35 hours per week.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.748" offset="915446">That was the regulation which was in effect when this litigation began in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.762" offset="943554">The claimants in this case, all applied for Maryland AFDC-UF benefits, after applying for and being denied, Maryland unemployment compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.682" offset="983155">Claimant Robert Francis, a laboratory technician, was denied unemployment insurance because he was participating in a strike which resulted in a work stoppage at his plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.448" offset="1030280">Claimant Edward Wright, who intervened in the Francis case, was disqualified because he was fired from his job as a carpenter for excessive absenteeism in the Maryland Unemployment Insurance Agency determined at that time, the constituted gross misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.959" offset="1092347">Claimant Barry Bethea(ph), who files a separate action, which was consolidated with Francis case, on appeal was disqualified from unemployment conversion, when it was determined that he had voluntarily left his job as a truck driver delivery man without a good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.643" offset="1163087">All these claimants were then denied AFDC-UF benefits in Maryland pursuing to Maryland’s Social Service Regulation, 702091082, which provides that a grant may not be paid for AFDCE which it is Maryland label for AFDC-UF “To meet need due to being disqualified for unemployment insurance.”</text>
            <text syncTime="289.006" offset="1256501">The Three Judges District Court which was convened in the Francis case determined in its first decision which we described in our brief as Francis I, that this Maryland regulation did not violate the Equal Protection Clause, as claimants had alleged, but that it did violate the predecessor version of 233-100A1.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.678" offset="1323165">In a courts’ view, that regulation did not permits States to consider any factors other than hours worked in determining unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.072" offset="1360781">As a result, the District Courts subsequently enjoined enforcement of the Maryland Regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.190" offset="1385232">When that injunction was appealed by the State to this court, the Solicitor General advised the Court, that HEW had always interpreted the statue and its own regulation to permit other State eligibility factors such as contained in the Maryland Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.801" offset="1439671">However, since HEW had decided to amend its regulation to expressly permit regulations such as that of Maryland, the Solicitor General recommended Summary Affirmance, and this Court took that action.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.860" offset="1491916">Thereafter HEW did amend the regulation as the Solicitor General had indicated and the regulation now requires that States pay benefits to those persons who work less than 100 hours per month except that States are permitted to deny benefits to persons engaged in a labor dispute or engaged in conduct resulting or which would result in disqualification under the States Unemployment Compensation Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.142" offset="1589092">After that Regulation was amended in that manner; Maryland filed a motion to resolve injunction in Francis I, but the District Court in Francis II decision held that the Maryland Regulation was still invalid on the ground that the amended HEW Regulation now violated Section 407A.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.415" offset="1674146">The decision in Francis II not to vacate the previously entered injunction was based on a theory that Section 407, relates to unemployment of a father.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.537" offset="1714584">And a father, who was discharge of the cause is unemployed, and HEW by regulation cannot permit States to deny benefits to person who would fall within this ordinary meaning of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.057" offset="1764739">With regard to persons out of work as a result of a labor dispute, the District Court held the amended regulations do not establish any standards for the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.179" offset="1797235">It did not prescribe standards as the statute provided, since it granted discretion to the States to deny such or to pay such benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.530" offset="1830568">The separate District Court decision in the Bethea case, adopted the same reasoning as the Francis II decision did with regard to misconducts.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.034" offset="1860661">The Bethea case was the one which involved persons who had voluntarily quitted without a good cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.426" offset="1878215">The Court there held as in Francis II, with regard to misconduct that such persons were in fact unemployed and under the statute, the Federal Agency had no authority to deny benefits to such persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.750" offset="1927430">Court of Appeals affirmed those two District Court decisions in a Per curiam decision adopting the reasoning and conclusions and not offering any rationale of its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.379" offset="1965986">As I indicated earlier, the State believes that the basic issue in this case, is of the scope of HEW’s ruling authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.135" offset="1997020">We contend that the issue is not whether AFDC-UF benefit should be paid to misconducts, to strikers, or the persons who have voluntarily quit there jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.455" offset="2030248">Rather the question is, whether the statute gives HEW the authority to allow States to choose to pay such benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.175" offset="2073193">Our position stated very briefly, is that statute constitutes a very broad grant of legislative type of rule making authority, HEW and that the regulation constitutes a reasonable exercise of that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.950" offset="2132230">There obviously, can be no question that the language of the statute expressly grants about rule making authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.909" offset="2156158">We believe that those statutory words fall within the label that the Professor Jaffe and Davis had devised namely, legislative type of rule making.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.566" offset="2190744">Other commentators refer to them as prescriptive or substantive rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.545" offset="2210701">And it is well established, that such rule making is to be given substantial difference by the Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.245" offset="2237451">As this Court stated in Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, the ultimate standard of review is a narrow one.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.218" offset="2265350">The Court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.487" offset="2286457">Thus, the HW Regulation, we contend is valid and should be upheld if it is reasonable under the statute even if the Court favors a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.704" offset="2327312">Claimants and the District Court avoided the issue of the broad scope of rule making authority containing Section 407 in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.339" offset="2357823">First, as I indicated, they argued that the regulation was invalid because it excluded from the persons’ from programs, certain persons’ who fell within the ordinary meaning of that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.254" offset="2401500">We would respectfully contend that that reasoning begs the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.226" offset="2417382">The purpose of the statutory words was to give the rule making authority to HEW and for HEW to give content to the term unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.388" offset="2458029">The term has never been self defining in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.929" offset="2472239">It was not self defining in 1961 and it is not self defining after 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.979" offset="2496377">Reliance on a dictionary meaning cannot answer such a question as this court had so recognized in the Burns v. Alcala case which concerned the meaning of the term 'dependent child'.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.783" offset="2543606">While the District Court and the claimants choose to rely on the dictionary meaning of the term 'unemployment', of course, they choose to ignore totally, the dictionary meaning of the words in accordance to standards prescribed by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.170" offset="2593134">The District Court also avoided the question of the scope of rule making authority contained in 407 by holding with regard to persons’ who had participated in a labor dispute, that the Section mandated a uniform national definition of unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.294" offset="2661679">Therefore, the District Court reasoned that the limited grant of discretion to the States with regard to such persons’ disqualified for participation in labor dispute was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.382" offset="2717999">I do want to mention at this point that Maryland agrees with the point raised by the Solicitor General in his memorandum, that the Court does have to get to the question of the validity of the regulation in connection with persons’ participating in a labor dispute because in Maryland, all the claimants and the Maryland rule only operates against persons’ who are disqualified for unemployment insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.098" offset="2804830">It so happened that the leading name, plaintiff was a person who was participating in a strike but he was denied benefits because under the Maryland rule, he was disqualified from unemployment insurance.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel J. Rabin</label>
            <text syncTime="748.274" offset="3093536">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.716" offset="3107328">The legislative history with regard to Section 407, it has been said out at great length in our brief, claimants brief, the appendix and the decisions below and I will not try to repeat it.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.073" offset="3148811">It is true that there are phrases in the committee reports that talked about a national definition of unemployment.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.977" offset="3176396">On the other hand, it is also true that other reports talks about the statute as authorizing a national definition or in sometimes it is the same report that uses the phrase, a national definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.890" offset="3224043">And it is also true that those reports at some points used the actual statutory words namely, as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by HEW.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.215" offset="3261346">It would have been very easy for the Congress to mandate a national definition with regard to a uniform national definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.255" offset="3301470">All they would have to in 1968, would have been to substitute the word 'Secretary' for the word 'State' in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.875" offset="3328011">This fact was recognized by the District Court in its Francis I decision but and that decision points out Congress chose instead to use new words which did not mandatorily require the Secretary to require each state to adopt the same of the word, unemployment but instead merely authorize the Secretary to prescribe a national meaning if the Secretary so desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.021" offset="3420589">The many statements as to the intent of the 1968 change must be considered in connection with the actual words used in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.296" offset="3457683">This court has recognized, the most persuasive evidence for the purpose of a statute is the words by which the legislature chooses to give expression to its wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="848.105" offset="3492896">We think that when one considers the legislative history behind the 1968 amendments and looks at the words of the statute themselves, it is clear that Congress contemplated that the Secretary of HEW was free to allow the States limited discretion to vary the coverage in response to their different needs and policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.711" offset="3587354">Thus, under the broad authority granted by the Section, the federally prescribed standards could take the form of a national definition but they could also grant the States some discretion in some specific areas as in fact the regulation has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.386" offset="3650048">Assuming that to be the case, HEW's regulations still must meet the test of reasonableness under the statute or the courts must set it aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.076" offset="3680768">We think, it is clear that 233-100A1 does meet that test in connection with the purposes of the AFDC-UF Program as set out a statute and the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.095" offset="3728834">When the program was first adopted, President Kennedy indicated that it was intended for unemployed workers and he gave the example of a person who had exhausted his unemployment compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.278" offset="3765614">We have quoted at length in our brief from the statements by Congressman Burns, one of the co-sponsors of the original legislation, which makes clear that Congress did not intend that the program provide benefits to persons who are voluntarily unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.418" offset="3830189">And as originally adopted in 1961 and as amended in 1968, Congress made clear that the program was intended to provide assistance to persons and in connection with employment not covered by the existing Unemployment Compensation Program, that the program was not designed to substitute for that already existing nationwide program.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.278" offset="3909601">Furthermore, as amended the program is very similar in operation on unemployment compensation and that it is an Income Maintenance Program, designed to assist those who are unemployed not as result of their own conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.080" offset="3956830">In light of the similarity of these purposes, namely the persons who are involuntarily unemployed, we think it is clearly not unreasonable to attempt by regulation or to permit by regulation, a State to harmonize the operation of these two Income Maintenance Programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.209" offset="4029346">Namely, not to pay benefits under one scheme for conduct which results in a disqualification under the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.620" offset="4054946">We note that the District Court in dismissing the claimants constitutional claim, recognized this harmonization purpose as a rational basis for the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.723" offset="4107400">The court upheld the argument that the rationalization of these two programs which are both part of the scheme of cooperative Federalism described by this court in the King case established by the Social Security Act was a proper rational basis although the District Court did not necessarily agree with that basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.657" offset="4199142">It is certainly not unreasonable to grant States limited discretion contained in 233-100A1.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.185" offset="4225265">In one of the Public Assistance Programs created by the Social Security Act; when the statute permits such a grant of limited discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.422" offset="4258179">Now, the basic purpose of the statute is to extend assistance to a group of needy persons and this is true of all the public assistance programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.089" offset="4288794">By making partial Federal reimbursement available to those States which need certain substitute Federal requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.001" offset="4312514">Now, unlike the other Public Assistance Programs, 24 states have not joined the AFDC-UF program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.830" offset="4343756">Although, as indicated in our brief, three states have joined in the last two years and one state has dropped out of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.688" offset="4375208">As shown by the Solicitor General’s memorandum, a significant number of States, nine, if you count and include Maryland, have restrictions -- actually there is more than nine because the Solicitor General classified eight states with regard to cause and eight states with regards to strikers, so the total number of states who might be interested in this type of a restriction would be greater than nine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.068" offset="4468726">It is difficult for Maryland to see how the prohibition against such state discretion will encourage the general purpose of the program, of the statute through state participation in this program which is designed to assist needy, laid-off workers and unemployed through no fault of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.595" offset="4550855">We think that perhaps the best proof, of the reasonableness of the grant of discretion found on the regulation is the approach taken by the Federal Government itself in connection.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel J. Rabin</label>
            <text syncTime="1274.097" offset="5196915">We think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.935" offset="5200259">We think that this court made clear under Dublino decision, that in connection with the welfare cases, the Welfare Programs, the Courts are to get considerable attitude to the differing state interests, so that the programs can be developed in a flexible manner to meet the needs in particular States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.242" offset="5289493">The Congress is clearly aware of the issue of coverage of strikers in this particular program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.411" offset="5310078">That is shown by colloquia between Congressman Mills and Dominic, which is cited in claimants brief, so Congress knew, when this program was originally adopted in 1961, that it was not mandating or not prohibiting, in fact the colloquia goes to the effect, the Congressman Mills indicates that if states chose, they could make the payments to strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.159" offset="5421150">We think that, as I was saying, the example by the Federal Government in connection with the state administered Unemployment Compensation Program, we think is a good example of the reasonableness of the Secretary’s Regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.158" offset="5477157">Congress has been aware for years and the Federal Agencies have been aware for years, to the fact that a few states, pay unemployment compensation benefits to strikers and many states do not pay unemployment compensation to strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.125" offset="5537030">However, with regard to that particular program, which is administered by the states and it is financed through state taxes, Congress has decided to leave that discretion to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.751" offset="5583528">We think that that approach is no less reasonable when taken by the administrator of a program who is charged with broad authority to implement and supervise the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.376" offset="5625950">No less reasonable than it is, when it is taken by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.645" offset="5647057">Claimants contend that the HEW Regulation is invalid under the state eligibility decisions by this court in recent years in the welfare field, including the most recent formulation in Burns v. Alcala; the 1975 decision, I referred to previously concerning whether unborn children are necessarily covered under the AFDC program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.393" offset="5726052">However, contrary to their contention, it's our view that that decision really supports the validity of the HEW regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.708" offset="5759279">In Burns, the Court stated that a participating state may not deny aid to persons who come within the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.781" offset="5787596">In the absence of a clear intent that the Congress meant the coverage to be optional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.372" offset="5809957">Well, there is such an indication in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.842" offset="5819883">It is right in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.311" offset="5825735">Congress provided that the Secretary of Health Education and Welfare had the option to extend or restrict the coverage of the statute and also to grant a limited discretion to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.646" offset="5879025">We think that even more appropriate in support of the HEW Regulation is the reasoning of the Dublino decision to which I referred to previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.531" offset="5906610">We also think that the Louis v. Martin case which upheld HEW broad rule making authority with regard to the AFDC Program supports this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.305" offset="5937748">We think that the decision by this Court recently enabled behind which upheld the regulation by the Secretary of Agriculture also supports the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.620" offset="5970976">That decision cautioned the courts to defer to the informed experience and the judgment of responsible administrative agencies, even if they might favor a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.185" offset="6017265">The decision below interpret the statutory language, unemployment as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary, which is an expressed grant of very broad rule making authority, to mandate coverage for persons’ disqualified from unemployment compensation because they were fired for misconduct or because they voluntarily quit their jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.697" offset="6095214">And also, to bar any grant of discretion to the states as to payment to the strikers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.669" offset="6119142">In effect, they say that HEW has no broad authority with regard to that first category.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.634" offset="6138995">And with regard to the second category, HEW must either mandate payments on a nationwide basis or prohibit payments on a national basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.976" offset="6184344">We respectfully contend that that is not a reasonable interpretation of the statutory language or of the legislature history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.259" offset="6213497">It is now and the Solicitor General have demonstrated the regulations which HEW has promulgated under the statutory words, we think is a reasonable regulation in the Maryland Regulation which authorizes it are valid and the decision below should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.088" offset="6272847">I would like to reserve the remainder of my time, thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Christopher Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="1554.865" offset="6319972">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.781" offset="6335645">This case basically involves a question, whether or not, the Secretary of HEW has followed the power that he was given by Congress in a specific statute 42 USC Section 607.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.640" offset="6383083">The statute reads and as it is pertinent to this case, in defining who can get this certain kind of welfare benefit for families who do have children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.921" offset="6420177">That it must go to needy children whose “Father's unemployment as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary and so forth and so on with other pre-conditions.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.164" offset="6473154">So, we are talking about unemployment in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.639" offset="6494992">The Secretary in attempting to define unemployment has done so in various ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.614" offset="6514950">First of all, the Secretary has defined unemployment in terms of hours worked, which we have no quarrel with whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.968" offset="6536370">That is the most common sensible way in which to define whether or not a person is unemployed or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.798" offset="6555701">There may be other ways and maybe, whether or not, he has a contractual duty or right with respect to an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.322" offset="6581719">It could also perhaps be defined with respect to the rights that he has, seniority rights perhaps to an old job, very many aspects of what an employee might have to expect in a specific case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.807" offset="6635740">But the Secretary of HEW has not defined the term unemployment in that way, instead the Secretary has basically defined the term, by the legal consequences of the way in which a person lost his last job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.553" offset="6690701">So in addition, to defining unemployment in terms of hours worked, the Secretary also allows the States at their option if they so choose the definition of unemployment which turns on two things: one, whether or not that person is eligible for unemployment insurance and secondly, whether or not that person has been involved in a labor dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1961.181" offset="7945206">Unemployment is the first thing that pops to my mind in trying to define an unemployed person, is not to define the legal consequences that he may be suffering from another benefit program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.740" offset="7995466">That does not necessarily -- let us take this case, for example, a person who is allegedly committed misconduct in the job and therefore is now out of work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1994.275" offset="8077594">Seems to me, the Secretary is standing the definition on his head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.082" offset="8088775">Now, you can do that in certain situations, certain acts, for instance, the NLRA which has been talked about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.814" offset="8111763">It defines employee in ways in which the common person would not really define employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.797" offset="8131616">And there are many statutes which do that but there is no indications whatsoever in this case that the Congress intended the Secretary to come up with a term of art kind of definition, as opposed to the common sensible definition of what an unemployed person is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.631" offset="8195041">And indeed, if there is any hint to be had from how the Congress interrelated this program into the unemployment insurance schemes that went on in the private state, in each state, it would be I think, that it did not intend to disqualify this sub class of people.</text>

            <text syncTime="2132.542" offset="8630659">If you work more than no AFDC, you are not unemployed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.782" offset="8651557">Congress most rationally could have thought, let the Secretary pick the hour amount or perhaps let the Secretary define in another ways in terms of existing contract with an employer, amount of money to person earns as opposed to amount of hours of person works.</text>

            <label>Mr. Christopher Brown</label>
            <text syncTime="2269.255" offset="9177454">That is correct; I see nothing in the legislative history which points in that direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.805" offset="9191665">Another thing which points against that direction is this very significant concern, if you acquainted yourself with legislative history, you would see its various parts --legislative history almost says nothing in this case but one thing that it does say is that we want uniform national definitions set by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.464" offset="9258329">We want the Secretary to say what you can do States and what you cannot do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.164" offset="9273167">What the Secretary has done in this case in essence to say that if you want to, you do not have to but if you want to, you can disqualify people who cannot get unemployment insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.147" offset="9309111">Now, each state has its own different system of unemployment insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.144" offset="9325098">This book, a publication by the US Department of Labor talks about all the differences in all of the state programs on unemployment insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.685" offset="9355191">If the state is correct and the Secretary probably can allow states to exclude people who cannot get unemployment insurance compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.148" offset="9389046">You are going to have a different AFDC-UF program in every single state, almost by definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2328.482" offset="9414437">We think that would be the case because each state has different unemployment insurance system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.744" offset="9431469">And then also, the states do not necessarily have to disqualify people who cannot get unemployment insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.393" offset="9450068">The Secretary gives them the option of doing that or not doing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.978" offset="9464383">It is sort of confusing, the secretary is allowing us to define these people as unemployed, if we want to or as not unemployed, if a state, for instance, does not want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.333" offset="9505761">It cannot have it both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.740" offset="9511403">Its got to be one way, its got to be the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.767" offset="9519554">I think that is one of the problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.057" offset="9524674">If the Secretary would not be in as much danger in terms of invalidity of the regulation, if he had said it has to be this ,states you do this, you do this, you do this, and you do this and that is what you have to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.449" offset="9574306">Secretary of for various reasons, I think tried to play both ways and a person in this category, these people in this class, they are unemployed or they are unemployed, But they cannot be both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="2387.150" offset="9649121">Another aspect of which, I think, makes it very, I think it is reasonable to assume, that the kind of people who get AFDC-UF, this class of people here, are in many ways very different from the class of people who get unemployment insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.820" offset="9703769">And as a consequence, it is not at all unusual for Congress to allow the children of these parents to get this kind of benefit, whereas they will allow the states to disqualify their parents from getting unemployment insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.737" offset="9759462">Now, there are two different kinds of programs, they are very much interrelated, but this Welfare Program primarily is for children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.622" offset="9786943">You cannot get this kind of welfare, unless you have a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.464" offset="9802303">On the other hand, unemployment insurance is for parents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.585" offset="9814842">It is fact that you have children, do not have children really makes very little difference as to what kind of benefit amount you can get.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.640" offset="9839083">Unemployment insurance is for parents, AFDC is for children basically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.148" offset="9857056">Unemployment insurance gives money based upon employers’ contributions, welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.148" offset="9877118">AFDC gives it based upon tax revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.372" offset="9893941">I can very well see, a rational Congress saying “If this man committed misconduct, his employer should not have to pay his keep on employment insurance, for 13 weeks or 26 weeks or whatever, after he has been kicked off the job.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.281" offset="9953604">That makes sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.950" offset="9960292">Welfare Program, that is for children, incidentally, also Welfare Programs have very few fault concepts in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.685" offset="9987250">Normally speaking, we do not try to blame the child for something his father did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.379" offset="10005954">It maybe, that the fathers in this case are bad fathers, because they did not handle their work job in a correct fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.984" offset="10032390">But typically, the Welfare Programs in this Country and the Federal Programs specifically have not been concerned with fault in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.467" offset="10058303">Unemployment Insurance programs have that --</text>

            <text syncTime="2525.595" offset="10202812">You have to wait 30 days before you can apply to this program and most states also require you to go to the unemployment line first to get unemployment compensation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joel J. Rabin</label>
            <text syncTime="2631.366" offset="10625892">Just a few remarks, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.093" offset="10640834">I should point out to the court that although Solicitor General is correct that the Maryland rule operate on the basis of disqualification of unemployment insurance, it is also true that the reasoning that applies to that part of the regulation would probably have an impact as to the validity of the second part of the HEW Regulation and the disqualification, namely participation in labor dispute, and in fact, if the Court upheld the HEW Regulation, that, I think would dispose of the issue entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.176" offset="10773222">There was a pending regulation by HEW, which in light of the Lower Court’s decision proposed mandating payments to persons’ who are disqualified for unemployment compensation, except those persons’ who were participating in a labor dispute but the Secretary chose to hold up action on that regulation pending the outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.897" offset="10868099">I do want to indicate my agreement with major trust of Justice Rehnquist’s question and point out that in the legislative history, it is quite clear that Congress was thinking about the unemployment compensation scheme because in fact, President Kennedy in his statement proposing the program, used as an example, a person who had exhausted his unemployment compensation benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.011" offset="10964543">It is true that there are certain differences between these two types of programs but it is also true that programs are very interrelated and there is substantial overlap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.516" offset="11006548">For example, there is a substantial work experience requirement in the AFDC-UF Program, which in most cases, under many State Laws would make the person eligible for unemployment insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2738.774" offset="11055554">It is also true that in many states including Maryland, the benefits to receive unemployment compensation are affected by the number of children in your family.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.613" offset="11086901">There is what is called a dependency allowance, so I do not think that you can say that the programs are unrelated or that they are totally different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.258" offset="11125562">There are both Income Maintenance Programs designed to assist persons’ who had a substantial connection with the work force and who are now unemployed and it is our contention that their major thrust is to assist those person’s who are unemployed as a result to no fault of their own, involuntarily unemployed as the Java (Ph) decision itself pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.816" offset="11207691">Therefore, we contend, it is reasonable to permit the states to do in this similar program, what the states have already done in the other program, namely, had decided not to encourage or not to at least pay benefits to certain persons for conduct which they considered operates contrary to the basic thrust of the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.700" offset="11311240">I also want to mention, and I think that the word of art is a good phrase that is used by my colleague, which is exactly what the Congress had in mind when they passed the Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.946" offset="11340288">That was why they gave legislative type of rule making authority to the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.463" offset="11358365">In fact, the rule making authority given to the Secretary in Section 407, it is my understanding, is much broader than the authority that the National Labor Relations Board has under the National Labor Relations Act to define employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.944" offset="11412282">But the opinions of this court made clear that the he does have broad authority to define the word 'employee' in that scheme and we think that with a much more direct grant of authority in this case, the agency would have even greater authority and even greater difference should be paid to his judgment unless, it is arbitrary and capricious, and beyond the bounds of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.440" offset="11510189">I have no further remarks unless there are any questions, thank you very much.</text>
