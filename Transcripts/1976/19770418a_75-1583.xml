            <text syncTime="65.961" offset="364398">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.390" offset="382057">This case has spawned procedural complexities but what is at stake here is not at all complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.050" offset="416747">Nearly four years ago, the Attorney General of the United States, objected under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act to South Carolina Act 1205, a 1972 enactment reapportioning the South Carolina State Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.232" offset="501488">That enactment included three aspects which have been hallmarks of discriminatory effect namely, multimember districts, numbered seats, and a majority runoff requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.182" offset="565227">The Attorney General found that Act Number 1205 has a clear and substantial racial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.369" offset="617994">Following the Attorney General’s objection, South Carolina never availed itself of the alternate pre-clearance procedure open to it under Section 5, namely, a declaratory action before a District Court in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.260" offset="705557">Instead, the state has simply continued to give effect to Act 1205 without Section 5 clearance and it is that situation for which we seek regress here.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.963" offset="768355">The court below having refused our request for injunctive relief against continued enforcement of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.720" offset="811405">Basically, as we see it, we seek compliance by South Carolina with the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.211" offset="841394">Compliance which has generally been forthcoming in covered state.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.899" offset="860097">Indeed South Carolina itself complied with the Voting Rights Act in responding to an objection by the Attorney General to its House of Representatives apportionment plan and it enacted a new plan which ultimately met with approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.186" offset="957273">So that today the South Carolina House is apportioned in accordance with the law and today in the South Carolina House, there are a number of black members.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.476" offset="1010458">Today in the South Carolina Senate, there are no black members.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.105" offset="1032923">And the situation which I have described came about as a result of an error, a legal error of the Attorney General of the United States in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.066" offset="1080780">He first declined to object to Act 1205 not because he thought the Act was valid but because he thought he was compelled to defer to a District Court judgment in South Carolina sustaining the constitutionality of Act 1205 but disclaiming any intention to pass on the validity of the act under the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.459" offset="1206377">Now, I have referred rather flatly to this ruling of the Attorney General as an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.477" offset="1230409">I do so because it was determined to be an error in Harper against Levi because the United States has conceded the error both in this court and in the court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.067" offset="1296760">South Carolina was not a party to the litigation in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="306.077" offset="1324868">The determination of Harper v. Levi is not binding on this court, Your Honor, but we do suggest, in addition to arguing that the Harper v. Levi hearing was correct in determining that the limited reviewability that took place here was proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.753" offset="1415565">We also argue as an alternate ground that the Harper v. Levi court having jurisdiction to enter the interlocutory orders that it issued and the Attorney General’s time to object having been told under those interlocutory orders, the objection of the Attorney General was a valid act and if it ultimately would determine that Harper v. Levi reached a wrong result, this would simply free the Attorney General to withdraw his objection but would not nullify his objection not full time on the grounds of --.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Roger Wollenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="382.323" offset="1629769">I can answer that, it is our position that they were not entered after the expiration of the 60-day period.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.219" offset="1657354">It was the finding of the District Court in the District of Columbia that they were not entered after the expiration period.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.748" offset="1687552">Now, I am speaking now of the preliminary order that was entered by the District Court that extended the Attorney General’s power.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="405.355" stopTime="416.379">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="405.355" offset="1721929">Isn’t it a fact that that order itself was entered after the expiration of 60 days, following a submission of South Carolina’s plan?</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Roger Wollenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="416.379" offset="1766024">Your Honor, it is our position that it was not entered after the 60 days effectively began to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.717" offset="1799356">You will remember that this court held in the Georgia case, that the Attorney General’s regulations extending the beginning of the 60-day period until he had complete information on the submission before him was a valid exercise of authority on his part.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.302" offset="1873753">It was our contention in Harper which was agreed to by the District Court that the Attorney General’s time for acting had been extended by him in connection with requesting additional submissions up to June 19th, 1972 so that when we went before the District Court on August 10, 1972, the 60 days had not expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.605" offset="1978974">We believe, if Your Honor please, that that whole 60-day question is immaterial to the issues that are before this court.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="477.556" offset="2010739">What if you wrong on that -- if you say it is immaterial, you must mean that even if you are wrong on that and the Attorney General’s 60-day period had expired before there was ever any court order, you can nonetheless (Inaudible), is that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="492.376" offset="2069985">Precisely, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.270" offset="2101541">I was saying why the Attorney General’s action was an error and I had mentioned it was held to be an error in Harper against Levi and that the United States has now conceded both in the court below and in this court that it was an error.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.919" offset="2168205">I also add that this court’s controlling subsequent decisions in Connor v. Waller and most recently in United States against Board of Supervisors of Warren County established, we think, that if anything, the deferral should have gone in the other direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.773" offset="2235601">In other words, the District Court in South Carolina should not have been passing on the constitutional issue until the Attorney General has passed on the Section 5 of the Voting Rights issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.263" offset="2277606">Now the court below never reached this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.544" offset="2286697">The court below found that the Attorney General’s ruling on Act 1205 was improperly reviewed in Harper against Levi and on that premise it treated the Attorney General’s definitive objection to the statute as a nullity.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.382" offset="2350017">I think the parties here including the United States, which is here as amicus, are in agreement that the central issue here is whether the Attorney General’s initial determination --.</text>

            <text syncTime="598.549" offset="2494736">As I was indicating, the central issue here is reviewability.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.186" offset="2517305">If the limited reviewability that we are talking about here which is not reviewability on the merits, is not review of whether the Attorney General should have found the act to be objectionable or not but only review of his legal statement that he was compelled not to enter his own independent judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.786" offset="2607689">If it was reviewable as we contend, the United States agrees and as Harper and Levi squarely held, then we submit the sole basis of the decision below is destroyed.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.744" offset="2651470">I turn now to the limited reviewability issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.839" offset="2663905">Mr. Justice Rehnquist, with reference to your earlier question, the reason that we regard the 60 days as immaterial to the present case is that it is established law, we think, under the Administrative Procedure Act under this court's decision in Dunlop that and the International Harvester case which we have quoted and cited in our brief that “where there is judicial review, the statutory period which is created and imposed on an administrative agency for its action is not governing the court in engaging judicial review.”</text>
            <text syncTime="687.408" offset="2850105">The present case is a perfect example of why that has to be necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.840" offset="2863898">If the Attorney General remains silent until 11 o’clock on the night of the 60th day, there would hardly be time for a judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.249" offset="2909456">If there is judicial review, then the courts have uniformly held that the power exists within a reasonable time after the agency has committed the action complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.585" offset="2958879">In this case, there can be no question of laches, obviously, the case was brought very quickly either just before the expiration of the 60 days, Mr. Justice Rehnquist or immediately after depending on how you calculate the 60 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.316" offset="3017812">In either event, it was brought in a timely fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.474" offset="3034425">The reviewability, we think, is essentially un-debatable.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.845" offset="3059921">The Administrative Procedure Act was designed to fill the interstices in statutes which created review but which for some reason did not create review complete enough to deal with a critical situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.663" offset="3127212">And as the court is well aware, there are three well established exceptions stated in the Administrative Procedure Act and none of them applies here.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.308" offset="3165769">One of them is where Congress, in so many words, has precluded judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.106" offset="3188966">Congress has simply said of this particular action there will be no judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.576" offset="3210804">Congress knows exactly how to do that and that Congress remembered how to do it in this case, is established clearly by the fact that it used that kind of language in Section 4 but did not use it in Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.962" offset="3260332">A second major area of exception is where the matter is committed to agency discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.893" offset="3308084">The action here of the Attorney General is not in any sense committed to agency discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.696" offset="3339327">The Attorney General’s own regulations recognized that he acts in a quasi-judicial capacity that he is in effect acting to pass on a submission of a covered state in lieu, if he finds affirmatively, in lieu of the Three-Judge Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.065" offset="3412783">His own regulations state that he will apply the same standards that the court does and this court reviewed his activities in that regard, in the Georgia case and made clear its view that the Attorney General does not act on a discretionary basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.680" offset="3475268">Finally, there is the recognition even by the appellees that it is well settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.549" offset="3522706">I am referring to their Note 68 in their brief at Pages 37 and 38 where appellees say that the courts may determine whether an official is acting beyond the scope of his statutory authority, even in those cases where they can not review the manner in which he exercises his authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.880" offset="3603999">And that, we suggest is what occurred here in substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.598" offset="3626883">So in some then on the reviewability question, we submit that it is clear that Congress did not preclude judicial review. It is clear that the action involved was not committed through agency discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.916" offset="3712146">And finally, we think it is clear that there is not an adequate remedy at law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1032.388" offset="4230102">I think that the particular formulation in Evers suggested that he was not making the decision one way or the other on the merits which the District Court in Evers thought he should have made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1054.067" offset="4316829">The appellees and to some degree the court below, have made a great deal of the notion that really not having the Attorney General perform his function really does not damage anyone because Section 5 has preserved the rights of plaintiffs to go to Three-Judge Districts courts in the state and pursue the matter under the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.371" offset="4398017">So the fact that the Attorney General has cleared the statute, really does not hurt anyone and these other remedies are adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.733" offset="4427483">The short answer to that, we believe to be a given rather eloquently in the Amicus brief for the United States in this court which we respectfully adopt in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.327" offset="4473772">And I would say here only that this kind of a defense or this kind of an argument flies in the face of the whole philosophy of the Voting Rights Act, which is adopted by Congress and upheld by this Court in South Carolina against Katzenbach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.059" offset="4540750">The Congress of the United States did not think that the Fifteenth Amendment remedies that existed before that and still exist and were preserved in the act were adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.648" offset="4579098">That is why the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.989" offset="4584427">The Voting Rights Act placed the burden on covered states, required them to show that their new proposed legislation would not be discriminatory in purpose or effect and gave them an opportunity of getting that clearance either in the District of Columbia Court or with the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.156" offset="4653181">If they can get it with the Attorney General without his performing his duty then we submit that that destroys basically renders nugatory, the whole essential structure of the Voting Rights Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1669.228" offset="6777459">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.967" offset="6796372">We believe that the petitioners should prevail in this case because the Attorney General’s objection to Act 1205 reapportioning the South Carolina State Senate was a valid objection under the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.715" offset="6863350">Although, the Attorney General initially determined himself to be without authority to express his independent view that this act deluded minority voting rights because of the decision of a three-judge reapportionment court in the Twiggs case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.007" offset="6928551">The matter was promptly brought to the attention of the District Court for the District of Columbia which ordered the Attorney General to use his own discretion and he did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.890" offset="6972019">Subsequent decisions of this court confirm that the District of Columbia Courts in Harper were right and that the Attorney General’s deferral policy was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.445" offset="7026249">The fundamental question here then is whether the Attorney General's mistake of law was properly and legally corrected by the Harper Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.053" offset="7068672">If so, the objection stands and Act 1205 may not be implemented legally under the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.480" offset="7094481">If not, the court below was right, and its judgment should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.032" offset="7116633">In the limited time available, I would like to address the following issues: First, whether the Voting Rights Act contemplates an independent review by the Attorney General of submitted legislative changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.431" offset="7182252">Secondly, whether the Voting Rights Act properly construed permits the traditional remedy in the nature of mandamus to compel the exercise of administrative discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.628" offset="7235020">And third, whether relief, such as that granted by the Harper court would be disruptive to the administration of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.111" offset="7276920">The independent review is contemplated by the act we argue because it is inherent in the statutory scheme which congress has provided us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.648" offset="7315059">The Attorney General is a substitute or a surrogate for a declaratory judgment proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.151" offset="7341077">It is a quick 60-day review but it is a review on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.969" offset="7364378">Whether the change is discriminatory, is the issue for the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.809" offset="7387784">Certainly, Congress believed and had the right to believe that the Attorney General would do some reviewing and not merely look at it or decide that he was not going to review anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.305" offset="7445776">He was, after all, given the job to be a surrogate for the District Court of the District of Columbia.</text>

            <text syncTime="1887.784" offset="7651621">First, the proposal was for review on the merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1892.093" offset="7668861">Here we are talking about a much more limited kind of review, so I don’t think the two proposals are parallel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.690" offset="7699268">And secondly, Congress rejected it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1902.484" offset="7710448">So it was not passed that the Attorney General’s decision on the merits should be reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.993" offset="7740437">And I again stress, it is not what we are talking about in this case, we are talking about very limited mandamus type review in the District Court of the District of Columbia.</text>

            <label>Mr. Turner</label>
            <text syncTime="1935.736" offset="7843464">It has in this sense, Your Honor, that as we advised this court in the Georgia litigation, if you recall that and Footnote 6 in that opinion sets forth how the Attorney General and the courts were trying to accommodate at the intersection of reapportionment litigation and Section 5 litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.211" offset="7929354">And one of the policies that we expressed at that time was one of deferral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.866" offset="7947954">In our brief in that case, we indicated that that policy of deferral was under attack on the Harper litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.770" offset="7987555">Since then the Harper litigation has decided that that policy was wrong and we were ordered to stop it and this court confirmed that judgment in Connor versus Waller and we now accept it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.774" offset="8043562">We have always thought this multimember system was dilutive in abridge minority voting rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.791" offset="8067699">We did not express that opinion solely out of deference to the three-judge court in the Twiggs litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.974" offset="8092359">That deference turned out that we were not only wrong, we were dead wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.917" offset="8108137">The deference should have gone the other way and in Waller, this court said that district Courts in that situation should defer to the Attorney General until his determination has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.522" offset="8162576">So that it is a basic mistake of law to defer, I think, Mr. Justice that we are talking about here and not review of particular decisions made by the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.451" offset="8242301">The record here indicates that this is the only case in which the Attorney General followed this policy of deferral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.176" offset="8277201">On page 31 of the Appendix, the position of the Chief of the Voting Section of the Civil Rights Division established that this Harper case or this South Carolina Act 1205 is the only one in which that deferral policy, a very short lived policy was followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.021" offset="8364554">So the case is one of a kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="2084.978" offset="8440414">But I think it is important to establish whether or not there is this limited kind of mandamus or arbitrary and capricious review potential over the Attorney General’s administration of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.356" offset="8513975">The Harper suit was based on 28 USC 1361 that was recited in the complaint and then recited in the Court of Appeals opinion that very unequivocally gives the District Court’s jurisdiction to compel the performance of official duties owed to the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.406" offset="8610105">This kind of action has been described and recognized in this courts opinions as “the familiar rule that a court may exercise its equity powers or equivalent mandamus powers to compel courts boards or officers to act in a manner with respect to which they may have jurisdiction or authority”, although, to address your concern Mr. Chief Justice, the court will not assume control or guide the exercise of that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.690" offset="8739255">That is out of Virginian Railway Company in 300 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.781" offset="8759630">This kind of review is explicitly recognized in the Administrative procedures Act, Section 7061 which says that the reviewing court shall compel agency action unlawfully withheld and courts require, as you know, convincing evidence before that kind of review is withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2190.556" offset="8862762">So unless the Voting Rights Act precludes such relief that this rule ought to control this case, in our review and to address the venue question, I think 14(b), suggests strongly that this District of Columbia Court was the only proper venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.018" offset="8944577">But we have found nothing in either the terms of the act or its purpose with the legislative history that indicates a view that congress intended to foreclose this kind of limited review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.758" offset="8995568">It is true that a great amount of discretion is vested in the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.250" offset="9021482">The distinction is that the mandamus compels him to exercise it and does not tell him how.</text>

            <text syncTime="2765.733" offset="11163418">We find it very puzzling that the United States is taking some of the positions it has taken here this afternoon because the opposite positions are being taken in other litigation at this time or have been taken since the Harper case was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.824" offset="11235830">For example, the question of whether a mistake of law is reviewable was presented in a case called Harris against the United States, here in the District of Columbia District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.344" offset="11285880">That case is reported in 415 Federal Supplement and the Attorney General in that case, which is a post Waller case, took exactly the opposite position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.575" offset="11322765">Several questions were raised as to whether he has committed fundamental errors of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.311" offset="11345753">Among the allegations with it, he had addressed himself to the question of the one person one vote standard in a Section 5 review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.374" offset="11382011">It was claimed that Section 5 does not authorize him to get into the one person one vote standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2834.275" offset="11437599">It involved the question of his withdrawing an objection and the basic claim being made by the plaintiffs, Mr. Justice Stewart, was that he had withdrawn an objection with no new evidence being placed before him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2852.234" offset="11509488">That was the threshold question which was presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.983" offset="11520460">The Attorney General said no, this is not reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.074" offset="11532790">The position we are taking in this case, the court found against him in part citing Harper against Levi and for him in parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.218" offset="11565390">But we see no distinction between the questions raised in Harris and the kind of question that was raised in Harper against Levi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.063" offset="11596737">We do see an inconsistency of position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.049" offset="11612724">Now I also understood Mr. Turner to say that if an objection is fundamentally wrong, an objection of the opposite case from Harper v. Levi where the Attorney General said no objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.960" offset="11664342">But if an objection is fundamentally wrong I understood him to say that yes, in that case private parties could seek review of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.542" offset="11694644">Now of course the same judge that ruled against the Attorney General on that issue in Harper v. Levi found the other way when that question was presented in Griffith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.831" offset="11739784">But beyond that in a case called Robinson v. Potenger, we find that the Attorney General took the opposite position on that as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.269" offset="11793596">There are some officials in Montgomery, Alabama were again raising some of these questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.713" offset="11819405">He said in that case we cannot even be made parties to this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.878" offset="11836019">That is how immune we are from court review, much less getting into these questions of law.</text>
