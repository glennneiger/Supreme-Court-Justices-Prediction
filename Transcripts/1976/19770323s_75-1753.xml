            <text syncTime="9.308" offset="137746">This involves a Delaware so-called short form merger between a parent and a subsidiary, the subsidiary being over 90% owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.161" offset="197097">This merger was undertaken for the sole purpose of removing the minority shareholders from the subsidiary.</text>

            <text syncTime="89.437" offset="458217">Here, the complaint alleged neither misrepresentation or manipulation and the complaint should have been dismissed, so we reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.088" offset="516835">Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Steven says each filed a -- an opinion concurring in the judgment and all but part for the opinion filed which I have filed with the -- with the clerk.</text>
