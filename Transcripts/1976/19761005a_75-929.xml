            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100523">We will hear arguments first this morning in no. 75-929, Estelle against Gamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.947" offset="148275">Mr. Pluymen, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bert W. Pluymen</label>
            <text syncTime="15.523" offset="162590">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.270" offset="173561">This case arose when the respondent J. W. Gamble filed an action under 42 U. S. C. Section 1983 to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, alleging an adequate medical treatment for a back injury, which he has sustained in filing suit against the Director of the Texas Department of Corrections, the warden of his unit, the Medical Director who is also the Chief Medical Officer of the prison hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.386" offset="298009">District Court without requiring the State to file a response, without asking for any response summarily dismissed the claim rather for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.748" offset="351507">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit subsequently reversed the remand of the case with instructions to reinstate the compliant, appoint counsel, and permit amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.031" offset="404588">Your Honor, the crux of this case is whether the Federal District Courts will in the future and the Fifth Circuit sit as medical review boards to review the diagnosis and treatment by doctors in correctional institutions or whether that Federal Courts and the Fifth Circuit will operate within the confines as the limitations imposed by the Constitution and by the jurisdictional part of Section 1983 which is 28 U. S. C. 1343.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.964" offset="544291">In looking at a complaint it is established law by this Court that a complaint should not be dismissed summarily unless it is beyond doubt that plaintiff can prove no facts in support of his claim, which would entitle him to relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.410" offset="598103">Well, in the area of prisoner medical care there are only two places in the Constitution where a claim can possibly be stated, one is underneath the Eighth Amendment Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, the other is under the Fourteenth Amendment, Due Process Clause; a section relating to life.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.420" offset="666126">Your Brief I believe indicates that because of changes in creation of administrative procedures as kind of a problem will tend to go away in the future, is that so?</text>

            <text syncTime="158.550" offset="734672">I failed to see how a creation of administrative procedures will be helpful in terms of an issue whether a compliant, states a claim upon which relief can be granted.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bert W. Pluymen</label>
            <text syncTime="179.998" offset="820458">No, Your Honor I do not except for one instance, and that is that at the time when this complaint was filed in 1973 the grievance procedure which was subsequently written into the rules and regulations, in other words the appeal with the word and then to the director and director sending someone down from the staff to investigate the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.082" offset="900810">Those were in effect fact in 1973 and have been for quite a while.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.874" offset="915961">There were merely made written rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.564" offset="926724">They went through the formal procedure of passing it through the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.472" offset="954309">I do not see how and when question comes up is to whether the claim has been stated, how the existence or non-existence of a grievance procedure would help in any matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.939" offset="1004255">As a matter of fact, under both the grievance procedure and that Inmate Legal Assistance Project which was cited in respondent’s brief the inmate does not have to utilize either one.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.162" offset="1045111">He can go directly in the Federal Court and file a complaint, and the established law in that area right now is that no exhaustion is required under Section 1983 the latest ruling as the Court knows being McCray v. Burrell by the Fourth Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.017" offset="1104565">If we decide that this Court should decide that administrative remedies have to be exhausted and utilized first, to what extent do you think that would solve this problem?</text>

          <turn speaker="bert_w_pluymen" startTime="261.634" stopTime="332.778">
            <label>Mr. Bert W. Pluymen</label>
            <text syncTime="261.634" offset="1146988">As far as a flood of litigation in the Federal Courts is concerned, which the courts have experienced, the District Courts over the last five or six years I think it would help tremendously.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.984" offset="1192441">Minnesota has had experience with it; Maryland has had experience with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.644" offset="1211041">An independent grievance type procedure has helped tremendously in reducing the burden on the Federal Courts and also the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.337" offset="1241865">But as an alternative Your Honor, the State of Texas has a Tort Claims Act, which inmates are presently utilizing to sue the State, it is Article 6252-19, and in addition to being able to sue the state itself and obtain money out of corpus of the state, the inmate has the regular common law tort remedy to sue the doctor individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.075" offset="1348758">So it is petitioner’s position that the respondent in fact has state remedies and that the Constitution itself and the Federal Courts should not under the Eighth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment hear ordinary negligence from medical malpractice or tort claims.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.219" offset="1469339">The only thing the Tort Claims Act does Mr. Justice Rehnquist is it establishes liability on the part of the state itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.675" offset="1499223">There is an alternative; you can either try to take the money out of the doctor’s pocket under the Tort Claims Act or take it out of the state’s corpus.</text>

            <text syncTime="410.128" offset="1741013">Does the complaint just get filed or is it somehow or other screen by a magistrate for leave to file in someway?</text>
            <text syncTime="415.651" offset="1763060">It was a little puzzling to me at that time to figure out what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.583" offset="1774763">Is there any automatic provision in the rules down there for you to be served when something is filed against it?</text>

            <text syncTime="472.085" offset="1988863">There is some determination made as to whether an inmate in fact happens to be a pauper we had some problems with that, so that has to be decided.</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.199" offset="7013254">The respondent would like to make just three basic points before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.281" offset="7033630">The first of those is that a Pro Se Petition by an illiterate prisoner alleging a violation of his constitutional right to medical care should never be dismissed without requiring a responsive pleading or at least examining the relevant medical records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.817" offset="7103743">Second, that a petition which sets forth a pattern of conduct, which establishes deliberate indifference by prison officials to the rights of prisoners to adequate medical care or to medical care at all, states a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.621" offset="7166959">And third, during from the procedural point to the substantive point that the complaint itself, under whatever standard, the Court chooses to apply Mr. Gamble’s complaint does state a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.540" offset="7218681">In reference to the question by Mr. Justice White just a few moments ago in the opening pages of the Fifth Circuit opinion, they state, we find the complaint sufficient in alleging that the action of the authorities was tantamount to a refusal of medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.763" offset="7279494">Later on, in the opinion they do state it was inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.290" offset="7289630">I would probably find myself an agreement with my colleague from the Attorney General’s office that is not entirely certain just which of the standards of the Fifth Circuit did apply in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1835.918" offset="7444170">I had cited the Court to an example from the Fifth Circuit case Robinson versus Jordan where the individual was complaining of severe rectal pain, saw doctors on several occasions, the doctors prescribed suppositories of some sort to treat this person’s pain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1978.937" offset="8016252">This is the standard we would urge before the Court today, and not the total refusal standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.907" offset="8036105">This standard is set forth in our brief, and explained in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.460" offset="8054286">This is the standard we would set forth before the Court and urge if that an allegation of deliberate indifference by prison authorities to the medical needs of a prisoner states a claim, this test has several advantages, one of them being you are not looking at medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.960" offset="8108307">You are not disagreeing with doctors, you are looking at the actions of the prison authorities, and I have cited nine examples in the brief for the prison authorities denied adequate medical care to this individual on administrative basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.650" offset="8155119">I would like to just bring back to the Court three of those, which we have, a very good example of what I am talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.056" offset="8188660">Mr. Pluymen pointed out this individual was never refused the opportunity to go to see a doctor or seek some sort of medical personnel when he was in pain, this is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.727" offset="8223351">On February 7th and 8th 1974, when he was in solitary confinement, he asked to go on sick call.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.199" offset="8253235">He was refused permission to go on sick call by prison guards not by medical authorities, but by administrative individuals by prison guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.491" offset="8286463">The Law Enforcement Assistants Association, branch of the Justice Department has stated in one of its recent reports that denial to access to sick call is an open invitation to inmates to sue the institution for its prima facie evidence of denial of medical care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.877" offset="8348007">He also had a prescription from one of the doctors that he did see that he received a lower bunk, the man had lower back injury, they prescribed a lower bunk; he never got one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.580" offset="8382802">Once again, an administrative decision by the prison authority not disagreeing it is a diagnosis, not disagreeing that it is the treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2368.190" offset="9573254">None of this was done in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2378.384" offset="9614005">In the Federal Courts, in the experimental project -- I am sorry in the Texas Department of Corrections, right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.324" offset="9641800">Those administrative procedures are now available in the Federal Bureau of Prisons, 35% of their complaints received favorable action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3344.500" offset="13478456">Your Honor, the apparent from our arguments today and more apparent from the two briefs that counsel and I had no disagreement, this is the law to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.949" offset="13524223">I have no disagreement with the deliberate indifference test, and the court should decide to use that test under constitutional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.041" offset="13560585">The only disagreement that we have comes to the application of the law to the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.985" offset="13588379">The deliberate indifference, particular occurrences cited by counsel in his brief are taken completely out of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.095" offset="13632892">The failure of the building department to issue him a lower bunk for one week during a course of medical treatment by Dr. Astone four weeks are failed to see how that stands out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.754" offset="13671449">His medical prescription for 30 days given by Dr. Gray which was lost for four and then given to him, I fail to see how that alleges any constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.577" offset="13722753">He is being threatened by a lieutenant and a sergeant 60 days after he was injured, and he was asked do you want to go to work, he said no, and they threatened to send him to the “farm”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.065" offset="13776774">That was some 34 days after Dr. Astone had ordered him to do light work, and he had refused to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.710" offset="13811361">He was taken before a disciplinary committee twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.906" offset="13824108">The first time after having been cured for by Dr. Astone for three weeks he said I still heard Dr. Astone has had me for 26 days under his cure, he did not even notice my high blood pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.303" offset="13873636">The disciplinary committee did not say go to work or we are sending you to solitary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.194" offset="13893281">They said we are going to send you to see another doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.688" offset="13903207">The very next day he saw Dr. Gray.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.882" offset="13911984">He remained under Dr. Gray’s care for two weeks after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.148" offset="13929016">It was not until 86 days or 40 days after that first disciplinary committee hearing; 86 days after the injury that he was taken before disciplinary committee the second time and that is when he was sent to solitary for refusing to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.596" offset="13998815">It had been a long time; he had been doctor’s care twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.972" offset="14012399">Doctor already ordered him to do light work months before he had refused to do it then, they finally cracked down on him, and sent him to solitary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.364" offset="14061927">So there is really no deliberate indifference in this case as far as constitutional standard or claim is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.552" offset="14090662">Bishop v. Stoneman which is cited by counsel as the best evidence or the best example of deliberate indifference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.224" offset="14121382">The allegations contained in that case are horrendous, back injury, request to see a doctor - it took six months, people vomiting blood, not seeing doctors for seven, eight days after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.632" offset="14183031">The facts are just -- it is not only difference in degree in that case, but in kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.003" offset="14208526">If Your Honors were serious about us typing up verbatim transcript to this complaint since we agree on the law Your Honors can determine for yourselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3538.303" offset="14253666">The application of all the facts, there is no sense in us arguing over.</text>

            <text syncTime="3565.900" offset="14364112">In this particular case, what difference does it make in terms of whether he stated a complaint or not?</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.073" offset="14400787">Upon reading the complaint he named the analgesics, Robaxin, febuverine, sodium salicylate, the EKG.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.215" offset="14433284">I spent two days in a county medical library trying to figure out the terminology that he states in his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.115" offset="14464944">He obviously copied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.990" offset="14472467">We do not even have to assume that he copied it out on his own medical record, but taking a look that the Court called up the medical record what difference would it make.</text>
