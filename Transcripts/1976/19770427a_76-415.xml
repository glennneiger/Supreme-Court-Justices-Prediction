            <text syncTime="17.652" offset="171053">Mr. Chief Justice it may please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.693" offset="191219">This case is an appeal from a decision of the Illinois Supreme Court affirming the defendant?s conviction after a bench trial under the Illinois Obscenity Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.768" offset="239493">The defendant was tried in March 1972 and he was charged under a complaint by a Police officer with offering to sell and selling two allegedly obscene magazines, Bizarre World and Illustrated Case Histories.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.485" offset="330400">His conviction was affirmed by the Illinois Appellate Court for the third district and the case was then appealed by petition for leave to appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.743" offset="379405">That Court considered the case after it had considered a case called People versus Ridens or Ridens II which was the case on the remand from this Court in 1973 which was decided at the same time with Miller versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.372" offset="453906">In Ridens II the Illinois Supreme Court on the remand held that the Illinois Obscenity Statute was still constitutional even in light of this Court?s decision in Miller versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.329" offset="509809">The defendant attacked the validity of the Illinois Obscenity Statute under principal analysis of Miller v California and that attack was rejected by the Illinois Supreme Court in an opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.945" offset="572293">The Court also held that the publications at issue in this case were not protected under the first amendment of the constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.131" offset="604999">While this case was pending in the Illinois Supreme Court, a three-judge Federal Court was convened in Chicago to consider the identical argument concerning the constitutionality of the Illinois Obscenity Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.484" offset="654422">On May 14 the Illinois Supreme Court announced its decision in People versus Ward below.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.161" offset="677097">On May 28 after having the opportunity to review the opinion of People versus Ward that three-judge Federal Court held the Illinois Obscenity Statue unconstitutional and entered a permanent injunction against its enforcement in a case entitled the Eagle Books, Inc. versus Reinhard.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Steven Beckett</label>
            <text syncTime="191.304" offset="865701">This court in Miller and also in footnote 6 in Miller and also in United States versus 12 200-Ft. Reels of Film, indicated that existing obscenity laws as construed hereto or hereafter may well be valid and in Hamling, the Court said that statement meant that we were not saying that all obscenity laws were unconstitutional, but in announcing Miller this Court said that State Courts on the remand must authoritatively construe those statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.822" offset="991715">As demonstrated in our briefs many states have done so and as such as have held their statutes constitutional.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="229.160" stopTime="233.679">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="229.160" offset="1017106">Has Illinois now construed its existing statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_steven_beckett" startTime="233.679" stopTime="321.920">
            <label>Mr. J. Steven Beckett</label>
            <text syncTime="233.679" offset="1035183">The Illinois Supreme Court has construed is statute, but in such a way as to not need the Courts remand order in Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.237" offset="1069456">In Ridens, the Court said that in response to the specificity attack that the statute as written because it finds prurient interest as a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion provides the specificity that this Court has required under Miller, under part (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="264.683" offset="1159213">That question was addressed by the Three-Judge Court and they rejected the State of Illinois? contention that the Illinois Supreme Court in fact and grafted on to its statute, the examples of sexual conduct under part (b) that this Court set forth in the Miller opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.003" offset="1232460">Additionally that Court noted that the Illinois Supreme Court did not rely on prior judicial opinions as so many other states have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.541" offset="1270599">In other words, this Court did not say in Miller what an authoritative construction was, but appellant submits to the Court that an authoritative construction is fixing words in the statute just as if the legislature had amended it, but in this situation, based on prior decisions, which had given a limiting affect to the statute and in Illinois that is not the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.920" offset="1388150">How do you think your case is different from People against NSCAP (ph) where the California Courts treated their obscenity statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_steven_beckett" startTime="329.372" stopTime="355.969">
            <label>Mr. J. Steven Beckett</label>
            <text syncTime="329.372" offset="1417929">In NSCAP the California Appellate Court indicated that our past decisions and they specifically listed past decisions and said that our past decisions under Section 311 of the California Penal Code had limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.284" offset="1477593">The application of our statute to hardcore sexual conduct and that nudity is not proscribed and some other rather definite statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.650" offset="1515105">The Illinois Supreme Court has never done this.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="355.969" stopTime="368.324">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="355.969" offset="1524300">But your opposing counsel at least contents that in earlier decisions of the Supreme Court of Illinois similar limitations were placed on the Illinois statute, you disagree with that?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_steven_beckett" startTime="368.324" stopTime="443.680">
            <label>Mr. J. Steven Beckett</label>
            <text syncTime="368.324" offset="1573724">I definitely disagree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.235" offset="1581456">Moreover the Illinois Supreme Court did not accept that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.468" offset="1598383">I think the specific decision that I think he is referring to is City of Chicago versus Geraci and that Court?s decision there has to be analogized to this Court?s decision in United States versus Hamling.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.603" offset="1654912">This Court said our past decisions in considering constitutional attacks on Federal obscenity statute and in interpreting those statutes have given them a limited affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.242" offset="1705485">A limiting affect that we have been really codified in Miller with those examples and so we have no difficulty in grafting examples (a) and (b) on to those Federal Obscenity Statutes and we said we are going to do so in United States versus 12 200 Ft. Reels of Film.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.156" offset="1769120">However, the Illinois case, the City of Chicago versus Geraci was not interpreting the Illinois obscenity statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.242" offset="1797436">As a matter of fact, it was interpreting an ordinance of the City of Chicago and second the discussion that mentioned the specific sexual conduct in that opinion was not talking about interpretation of the term obscenity or any derivative thereof, it was talking about the constitutional status of the publications.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="443.680" stopTime="455.042">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="443.680" offset="1875177">Would it be your contention that either the opinion in the question or the text of the statute itself must appeal to the prurient interest?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_steven_beckett" startTime="455.042" stopTime="560.917">
            <label>Mr. J. Steven Beckett</label>
            <text syncTime="455.042" offset="1920630">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.983" offset="1932437">The Geraci case in fact demonstrates the problems that people such as the appellant Ward and those in Illinois have in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.269" offset="1997534">The status of the law in 1971 with respect to obscenity as the Court is well aware is what Justice Brennan has called hopeless confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.759" offset="2031493">In this specific Geraci case, the Illinois Supreme Court took categories of publications and said for example that the United State Supreme Court and Central Magazine Sales has looked at publications similar to these and they depict bondage etcetera and that Court said that no matter what test you apply to obscenity those publications are entitled to constitutional protection, and therefore, the categories of magazines that we have here are protected under the First Amendment, and the Court went on to consider a magazine, the depictions of which are mentioned in the State of Illinois brief and said well we cannot find any cases that are exactly on this, but United States Supreme Court has looked at Sado-masochistic materials in Mishkin and affirmed convictions under that, but under Avansino versus New York and Shepherd versus New York and Friedman versus New York, the Untied States Supreme Court has reversed convictions under Redrupp (ph) type decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.026" offset="2288538">And then they go on to say well however you can interpret those cases, we are going to say that these magazines appeal to prurient interest etcetera and that they are obscene, that they are not constitutionally protected, rejecting the defendants contention.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. Steven Beckett</label>
            <text syncTime="596.123" offset="2484979">Pre-Miller, it was prior to date of the dissemination of the materials that alleged there is an alleged view crime in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.164" offset="2525103">The question under Miller is as Mr. Justice Rehnquist has said a question of notice, a question of notice to the defendant, appellant Ward, and to those similarly situated in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.574" offset="2598769">As we have set forth in our brief, decisions of State Courts, after this Court?s decision in Miller demonstrate that those Courts have taken a look at their statute as written, have taken a look at their previous judicial interpretations and constructions of those statutes and determined one of three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.070" offset="2692705">They have determined that their past decisions have limited the scope of that statute and that there was fair warning to the defendant, the statute is constitutional, his conviction is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.857" offset="2743905">They have determined that their prior decisions did not provide a limiting effect on the statute, that it would be unfair to this defendant to apply what they are now going to construe into the statute under Miller, and therefore, they would construe the statute to confirm with Miller, but they would give it prospective effect only.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.555" offset="2830736">Finally some states have looked to their past decisions, found no limiting construction and held that to change the statute now would be a form of legislation, our statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.553" offset="2882667">Illinois, I submit has done none of the above.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.698" offset="2911298">The state of Illinois contends that the Illinois Supreme Court incorporated this Court?s Miller examples parts A and B in its decision in Ridens II, People versus Gould.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.836" offset="2967826">The state then contends that the opinion below is of no movement because the Court had already included the A and B examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.756" offset="3015474">The opinion below, however, demonstrates fully and finally that the Illinois Supreme Court has not done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.460" offset="3054344">In the opinion, which is the portion, which I am referring to, which appears at page 30 of my brief, the Court reviewed the history of the Ridens? case.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.599" offset="3098857">The Court noted that the defendant was claiming that the statute did not provide specificity and that the specificity had not been supplied and the Court stated that in Ridens, we noted that the statutory definition of obscenity includes within the scope for prurient interest, a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex or excretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.966" offset="3188300">In answer to the defendant?s contention that was not enough that Miller required specificity.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.569" offset="3214736">The Court?s concluded by saying we again express our opinion that the Illinois statutory definition is sufficiently clear to withstand constitutional objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.135" offset="3252979">The statutory definition I submit has no specificity.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.887" offset="3268026">As a matter of fact the construction placed upon the statute in response to the remand order in Miller allows nudity to be proscribed in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.967" offset="3312329">The characterization is nudity, sex or excretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.876" offset="3328003">This Court?s holding in Jenkins of course says nudity is not enough under those Miller standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.193" offset="3365201">I submit to you that the Three-Judge Court's interpretation of Illinois law is persuasive on this Court under Gooding versus Wilson and that Court has completely accepted our contention as to what the Illinois Supreme Court has done.</text>

            <text syncTime="1511.776" offset="6147555">In response to key the question raised in this appeal, the State of Illinois submits that Chapter 38, Section 11-20 (b) its obscenity statute definition has been construed by Illinois Courts both prior to and after this Court's decision in Miller versus California, so as to limit its definition of obscenity to patently offensive portrayals or specific sexual conduct, thus giving proper notice of the offense of selling obscene materials and allowing the application of statute under the constitutional standards annunciated in Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.222" offset="6289348">Now, this case of course presents the post-Miller problem of what states have to in order to comply with the constitutional requirements of Miller versus California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.499" offset="6358416">There were many different approaches taken by the states after 1973 in trying to bring themselves into line with the Miller requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.053" offset="6392689">There have been the different kinds of approaches have been alluded to both in appellant?s and the appellee?s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.995" offset="6416408">Very often legislation was employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.187" offset="6429260">More often some, sort of, construction of statutes by the State High Courts was involved, and even within those group of states that decided to construe, to re-construe their statutes to satisfy Miller, there was a great diversity of opinion as to how this should be properly accomplished and what this case preserves, it focuses on one technique employed to construe a state statute into line with Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.233" offset="6549423">One technique out of an entire spectrum of techniques employed, and ask you to decide whether or not this is a proper construction of Illinois statute in line with Miller or whether the Illinois Supreme Court missed the boat, they used the wrong words, they should start over again and perhaps follow some other technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.528" offset="6634582">And I think it is true to say that in the spectrum of attempts to comply with this Court?s Miller requirements by construing state statutes, you start at one end with those states that took the approach which apparently is adopted by the appellant here and was adopted by the Court, a Three-Judge Court in the Eagle Books case in the Northern District of Illinois, that is the very literal approach that in order do it right, the state court has to sit down and say here are the Miller examples, here are the Miller requirements, we do now hereby incorporate those requirements and those examples into our state statute as providing the limitations as what can be prosecuted under that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.367" offset="6809916">That is the literalist approach and several states took that approach, notably Florida and Alabama and Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.744" offset="6839487">Then there is, I think in the middle, the Illinois approach, where the examples are reprinted, the standards are mentioned, and there is a blanket statement that re-construed the Illinois statute as incorporating these standards and examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.975" offset="6896329">Then on the far other end of the spectrum, you have some State Courts that attempted to accomplish this purpose, merely by making an oblique reference to the Miller standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.587" offset="6938857">As for the example, the Oklahoma Court did in Field versus Hess when they simply noted the, they bowed in the direction of Miller?s standards and they said well of course whenever our statute is applied, The Miller standards are implied, without getting in any specifics or reprinting them at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.618" offset="7006984">And so you have this entire spectrum and the center of the spectrum, I think the Illinois approach, is the one that Your Honors are requested to decide at this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1796.367" offset="7285972">I do not know if there was any, if that was comment on what they thought the Illinois Supreme Court have done or not, I have no basis for saying that, but I think this points out, this question, which you have just asked, points out what I think, I think there are two fundamental weakness in the approach of the appellant in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.019" offset="7360578">First of all I think the appellant ignores the plain intent and even some of the wording of the Illinois Supreme Court when it decided the relevant cases of People versus Ridens, second time around Ridens II and People versus Gould, I think they ignore the statements of the Court in the plain intent of the Court in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.800" offset="7447722">Secondly, and to me much more unexplainable is the complete failure to recognize the long and detailed history of obscenity law construction in Illinois prior to and at the time of the Miller by the Illinois Supreme Court and Illinois Appellate Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.853" offset="7527866">It is not true to say that the Illinois Supreme Court had only considered one case prior to 1972 in limiting its statute or that it only considered cases involving city ordinances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.798" offset="7579693">In our brief, part 3, pages 18, 19, 20 and 21, we have collected no fewer than 10 different decisions of Illinois Reviewing Courts dealing with construction and application of the Illinois Obscenity Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.517" offset="7634550">The earliest of these cases is People versus Sikora, a 1965 case, which dealt with a number of books that were brought before the Court and in which they held that certain specific kinds of Acts and I do not want to offend any sensibilities by going through them, they are listed on page on 19, including sadism and masochism</text>

            <label>Mr. Melbourne A. Noel, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1905.718" offset="7723366">Yes Your Honor, page 19 of our brief, including sadism and masochism were obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.435" offset="7750220">These descriptions in these books were obscene under the federal approach at that time and under the Illinois Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.949" offset="7784284">This was followed by and that was under the Illinois Obscenity Statute, not a not a state ordinance or a city ordinance, this was followed by the City of the 23.05, which was a review of a city ordinance, which was exactly identical to the state statute and the Illinois Supreme Court noted that in the decision and proceeded to deal with the ordinance as if it were dealing with the statue, they were indistinguishable, the one is simply a copy of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.979" offset="7896401">And in that case they added some other specific types of actions that were considered to be obscene under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.403" offset="7930047">Then you get to the case of the City of Chicago versus Geraci, which my opponent mentioned, that is the third case down the line from the Illinois Supreme Court and yet that occurred only in 1970, the start back is 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.972" offset="7976336">Now, in that case truly there was only a municipal ordinance that was concerned, but the definition of obscenity in that ordinance was much broader than the Illinois statutory definition and the Court?s concern, it used cases interchangeably between ordinance consideration and Statute consideration and the Illinois Supreme Court?s concern clearly was, does this material fall under constitutional protection or does it not and I will submit Your Honor, that is the proper approach to take and apply any obscenity statute, regardless of whether it is a state statute or an ordinance and regardless of what its wording is and the reasoning of the Geraci case applies directly to the type of situation we have into the application of a state statutory situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.480" offset="8158357">In fact Justice Schaffer who decided that case, quoted liberally from his Sikora opinion earlier which involved the state statute and then without going through all of them there are host of other cases, decided prior to and during 1972 and 1973, some from, not half of the Appellate Court, fewer than that and there are cases at least three prior to the time of the arrest in this case where the Supreme court said certain things are not prohibited by obscenity statute and one of the things interestingly they said in Geraci was that mere nudity was not prohibited by the state statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2266.674" offset="9167206">He can look at these examples, these statutes, these cases and he can go down and he pick off what he finds in his magazines or books and he can probably decide 99% of the cases on the basis of these examples, because they, while not completely all inclusive, I think they probably do cover the most common, most frequent types of obscenity that is going to be prosecuted and the bookseller is going to come into contact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.650" offset="9259053">There may be borderline situations that these examples cannot cover, as with the drug situation, well, I would not mention that, but as the mind of man advance new types of activities, they are going to be borderline cases that the Courts are going to have to rule upon and I think this Court recognized that in Miller and recognized that in Hamling, specifically said that path by itself, that path is not sufficient to render these statutes unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="2466.795" offset="9967702">I think that there are different kinds of activities that come under these somewhat general terms in the examples and I would say that this kind of material that you will see in these two magazines, Bizarre World and the Study of Sadomasochism can come under either of two examples here in Miller, patently offensive representations of ultimate sexual acts perverted, actual or simulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.702" offset="10075327">I think that if it is fair to say that Sadomasochistic actions of the type described here, certainly by definition Sadomasochism is designed to arouse sexual interest and sexual pleasure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.957" offset="10136349">It is a kind of sex related act which is perverted version of an ultimate sex act and I think it will come under that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2526.669" offset="10207193">It is almost impossible in the type of magazines that these are for you to have the pictorial content without having lewd exhibition of the genitals and so I think it comes under that example also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.180" offset="10257139">The two possibilities and I think there is plenty of authority for the proposition that it is pretty well excepted that Sadomasochism comes under these examples because for example my opponent?s brief when he talks about the New Hampshire Supreme Court decision, that Court said, ?We are going to take the Miller examples and they are going to become the limits of New Hampshire law, but we are going to spell out what they include and following paragraph, New Hampshire Supreme Court said those examples include sadomasochistic abuse.</text>

            <text syncTime="2999.280" offset="12097622">I think that it is totally incorrect to say that under the Illinois statute even on its face that mere nudity could be prosecuted in Illinois, other than the fact that the Supreme Court said in Geraci that it cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.615" offset="12150912">There is the simple fact that the Illinois statute requires and the comments to the statute that we have appended to the first part of our brief, I think are very illuminating as to what the intent of the legislature was back in 1961 when it passed the statute, and they said it and it is written in the statute that the matter of being accused or being obscene must go substantially beyond customary limits of candor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.650" offset="12247043">Certainly, in this day and age, no Illinois Court is going to say that mere nudity goes beyond the customary limits of candor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.125" offset="12272956">That element is written into the statute to prohibit the thing that was suggested here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.136" offset="12296989">There is no way that nudity can be prosecuted under Illinois statute, either under the face of the statute or under the Illinois decisions that have come down following.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.842" offset="12343800">I think that the state?s position is that there is support for the Illinois construction of the statute in Ridens II and in People versus Gould, direct support for it in this Court?s opinion in Hamling versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.865" offset="12411928">I think substantially the same approach was taken by this Court as by the Illinois Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.888" offset="12431990">This court being a little bit more specific, but I think the approach is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3085.752" offset="12443484">There is also direct precedential support in the State versus Watkins, which was one of the cases like Ridens, which this Court vacated and remanded, and sent back to South Carolina after the Miller decision was announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.878" offset="12495938">The State Supreme Court reaffirmed its prior ruling in a technique not to dissimilar to the Illinois technique said that we are going to limit our statute to types of obscenity such as those listed in the Miller examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.245" offset="12565423">That case came back up to this Court on appeal and the appeal was dismissed for one of those substantial federal questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.549" offset="12590710">So I think those are two direct precedents that are very closely analogous in justifying the decision of the Illinois Supreme Court in Ridens and in Gould.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.133" offset="12624982">Secondly, I would simply like to state that I do not believe it is true that if this Court ? well, we are not presented, this court is not presented here with the question of whether the Illinois Supreme Court failed to obey the remand of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.609" offset="12678899">The case that was remanded by this Court after Miller was People versus Ridens, Ridens versus Illinois in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.327" offset="12705753">That case of course went through the Miller again with Illinois Supreme Court and it came up again on a Certiorari petition making the same allegations that had been made today before this Court about the statute and this Court denied Certiorari by a 5 of 4 vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.019" offset="12764581">This case, the Ward case comes long after that situation and of course we are not dealing with a remand situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.927" offset="12804182">I do not think there is any question, Your Honors that upon reviewing the two publications involved in this case that they are obscene under any definition of hardcore pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.961" offset="12856323">The only publication that there seems to be dispute about even between the parties to this cause, is a publication called Bizarre World and I would submit to the Your Honor that the main part of that publication is a 16 page full color pullout ?called dungeon domination? and in that particular little item between pages 14 and 43, there are many examples of torture with the apparent blood on the victim and torture and lewd exhibitions of the genitals and I would submit that if sadomasochism itself can be prohibited by obscenity laws then this indeed is obscenity and is properly considered prohibitable in Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.261" offset="13037508">The other publication, it does not seem to be too much disagreement between the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.663" offset="13055167">I think that there can be no problem of retroactivity here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.457" offset="13070318">I think if he had consulted counsel in 1971 before he purchased and sold these magazines and we looked at the many decisions, prior decisions of the Illinois Court, which deal with sadomasochism, Mr. Wesley Ward would have known that he was selling magazines that were prohibitable under Illinois law and he should have taken warning if he had looked and noted that, he should have had proper notice that this was prohibited conduct and he would not have done it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.006" offset="13180450">I think there is no question here, but that the prior construction of Illinois statutes gave Wesley Ward sufficient notice that he could be constitutionally charged and convicted of the offences that were contained in his indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.810" offset="13239696">Thank you very much Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3289.907" offset="13260071">Just a couple of remarks, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.029" offset="13276581">First of all, I would like to assume for the moment because it is true that Mr. Ward did consult a counsel back in 1971 or prior there too and the status of Illinois law was just like the status of obscenity law throughout the nation, hopeless confusion, as emphasized, I think in that Geraci opinion where the Court said we really do not understand why the Supreme Court of the United States said material like this is constitutionally protected, but we are going to say it is not constitutionally protected and I submit that in that situation we are very hard pressed to say that these particular materials which are not hardcore materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.181" offset="13465185">They are not the type of materials that this Court described in Hamling versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.526" offset="13486605">You do not have explicit sexual activity in the one magazine Illustrated Case Histories there, there may be suggestions of sexual activity, but in the other one there are no suggestions of sexual activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.342" offset="13549822">The Illinois Supreme Court has an affect in Ridens, in Gould, in Ward, reenacted the Illinois obscenity statute and they have done so not by in grafting any examples of obscenity or any specificity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3379.516" offset="13618576">What do you think that the Court should do if it disagreed with you on everything except on the issue of the obscenity of warrant of these?</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.089" offset="13656819">I think that it would be a violation of the first amendment to allow a conviction for one constitutionally protected magazine to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.200" offset="13693286">In this situation the state can certainly charge obscenity in two separate accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.388" offset="13710004">So you have got the effect of a general verdict without knowing which magazine the judge relied on if at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.796" offset="13735604">In other words, the judge may have looked at Illustrated Case Histories and determined it is obscene, but the other one was and still convicted and now we get up to the United Stated Supreme Court, and they say, well, that judge was wrong, the other one is obscene.</text>
