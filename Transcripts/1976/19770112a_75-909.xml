            <label>Mr. Randolph</label>
            <text syncTime="98.698" offset="495280">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.405" offset="514089">These cases are here on writs of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth, Ninth and District of Columbia Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.234" offset="545436">At issue are the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 and regulations promulgated by EPA requiring respondents to take certain actions to control motor-vehicle air pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.689" offset="587231">Two of the Courts below, the Ninth and Fourth Circuits, decided the case on statutory grounds, holding EPA’s regulations invalid insofar as they required States to comply with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.274" offset="629550">District of Columbia Circuit’s decision is more difficult to summarize.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.830" offset="643760">Basically, it agreed with the EPA that the State as owner of a pollution source -- the highways -- could be required under the Act to reduce pollution, the State, the Court held, could be required to refuse registration to vehicles exceeding Federal pollution standards; but inspection must be done by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.963" offset="716276">We petitioned in all three cases, raising the issue whether inspection and maintenance could be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.999" offset="736443">The Commonwealth of Virginia cross-petitioned in the District of Columbia case, raising the issue of bus lanes and purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.734" offset="763401">In a decision not being reviewed here, the Third Circuit sustained EPA’s transportation-control regulations against both a statutory and a constitutional challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.843" offset="803839">Before I describe the Act and the regulations and focus the issues somewhat, I'd like to talk a little bit more about what particular subject is involved here, which is air pollution, a topic that this Court referred to in Washington versus General Motors as one of the most notorious types of public nuisance in modern experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.980" offset="876355">The chief culprit, or one of the chief culprits, is the automobile, spewing vast amounts of assorted poisons into the air and accounting for by weight, by tonnage, nearly half of all air pollution in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.988" offset="924420">Because of incomplete combustion and evaporation, the internal combustion engine produces carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.227" offset="957334">Because of high temperatures, it oxidizes nitrogen in the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.387" offset="978023">In the presence of sunlight, several of these pollutants react in complex ways, producing photochemical oxidants, or what is commonly called smog.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.390" offset="1009997">The result is thousands of deaths yearly, millions of days of illness and billions of dollars in health costs and property damage throughout the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.918" offset="1052107">One more fact, and I think this is very important to our case, air pollution travels, it moves.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.186" offset="1073214">It does not respect State boundaries, it does not stay located in one place.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.472" offset="1086379">The Court may have seen an article -- I don't know the truth of it, but it illustrates my point -- in last month’s New York Times where it was reported that the vineyards in western New York were being destroyed by air pollution from automobiles in Gary, Indiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.055" offset="1140714">I think that's as vivid an illustration as possible; whether it is true or not, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.955" offset="1160254">One other fact, in Section 101 of the Act that is in issue here, Congress found that the predominant part of the nation’s population -- this is the very first finding in the Act -- is located in the rapidly expanding metropolitan areas of the country, which generally cross State borders or are very near State borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.811" offset="1231725">Now, I don't think I exaggerate, before I talk about the Act, to say that when Congress legislated in the Clean Air Act, it was doing so and acting for many of the very reasons that the founders met in Philadelphia in 1877 and established the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.231" offset="1301419">Let me be explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.870" offset="1307898">One of the framers’ main objectives was to create a national system of government whereby one State could not pursue its own selfish interests to the injury and detriment of its sister states and the citizens of its sister states.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.372" offset="1361919">I think you all recall one of the most famous statements about why the Constitution met was made by Madison.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.807" offset="1383653">He likened New Jersey, sitting between Philadelphia and New York, as a keg tapped at both ends; or North Carolina, sitting between South Carolina and Virginia, as a patient bleeding from both arms.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.224" offset="1429315">My point is that in arguing here against national action, because of compulsion on the States, the respondents have to confront the Commerce Clause at its very core.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.910" offset="1476126">The air is a national resource; air pollution travels and as I hope to demonstrate in this argument, it is no part of our federalism that the health, the welfare and the property of the citizens of one state have to suffer because surrounding states refuse to take action to combat air pollution stemming from the use of their highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.478" offset="1570376">Now, in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, Congress recognized that control of air pollution was the primary responsibility of the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.029" offset="1604544">But strong national action was demanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.613" offset="1614889">Previous efforts, federal efforts, to combat the mounting crisis had failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.866" offset="1639966">The history as recounted in the Court’s opinion in Train versus NRDC, suffice it to say here that despite offers of technical and financial assistance to the States, the States had made little progress in meeting their responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.541" offset="1710601">The 1970 Amendments, if I can describe them quickly -- the Court had two cases last term dealing with the Clean Air Act, and I will be rather brief in the description -- in the 1970 Amendments, the EPA Administrator was required to set air-quality standards at a level that protects against the adverse effects on health and welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.120" offset="1804956">Section 110 of the Act sets forth the process for establishing State programs to achieve and maintain these air-quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.435" offset="1842258">Now, exactly how air pollution was to be controlled within a State was left initially to the State itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.879" offset="1876009">The State was to submit a plan to EPA, which EPA was required to accept if the plan met the broad outline set forth in Section 110 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.845" offset="1919894">Two of those requirements set forth in 110 are that the State plan contained, where necessary, transportation controls and an inspection and maintenance program.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.630" offset="1958974">If the State plan was deficient, EPA would issue a substitute, at least for those parts of the State plan that were deficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.320" offset="1989798">Although the State plans were due by January of 1972, EPA gave an extension to all the States where transportation controls would be required to meet ambient air-quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.983" offset="2028355">It did this because EPA realized, just like everyone else did, that we had very little experience with transportation controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.256" offset="2057507">As a matter of fact, that was why we had a problem; however, a Federal Court of Appeals sitting at the District of Columbia Circuit held that the Act did not permit this delay and ordered that the extension of time be rescinded, and EPA complied.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.988" offset="2120410">By late 1973, the process of formulating State plans had been completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.110" offset="2140890">Some of EPA’s final regulations, which in many instances, I might add, reflected State choices -- and by that, I mean reflected the choices of the States when they submitted proposals or proposed plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.041" offset="2188642">Imposed duties on the States with respect to State-owned highways and required the establishment of an emission inspection and maintenance program for vehicles registered by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.976" offset="2236394">Now, respondents' statutory argument in this case is that the 1970 Amendments do not allow compulsion on a State to act to reduce motor-vehicle air pollution; in other words, to put it bluntly, a State can never be in violation of an implementation plan designed to meet air-quality standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="577.495" offset="2410474">A State can be a violator, and I would say the respondents admit it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.044" offset="2432626">The question then is whether a State, by owning the highways, can be a source of pollution, an owner of a source of pollution which has to comply, like anyone else, with the Clean Air Act’s requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.846" offset="2491871">Certainly if the State owns a municipal incinerator, it is clear it is a source of pollution, and it has to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.530" offset="2526562">I think that is their position, and the EPA’s position, I think, is clearly set out in our brief and I think it is fundamental to our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.994" offset="2556446">The EPA Administrator determined early on before any constitutional issue was raised -- this was purely a matter dealing with statute, dealing with legislative histories, the judgment by Administrator, and I don't think it is open to reasonable doubt -- that the States, by owning the highways, own a pollution source and can be required to take action, just like a private source owner can.</text>

            <text syncTime="744.503" offset="3078477">We think it is quite a simple proposition that is involved here as far as the EPA’s determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.099" offset="3100838">Is it unreasonable, as the Administrator found, that when a property owner invites others to engage in certain activities on his property, the owner can be held responsible for the harm caused by those activities?</text>

            <text syncTime="764.749" offset="3159457">The property owner in this case happens to be the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.389" offset="3170010">The property is the highway.</text>

            <text syncTime="774.018" offset="3196551">Further, and as Mr. Justice Stewart said, we believe the highways are quite analogous to the sewer systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.002" offset="3220479">In both instances, the polluting matter comes not from the State, it comes from the private citizens; yet a State system of sewage disposal is subject to Federal regulation under the Commerce Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="920.365" offset="3781902">We set forth in our brief the legislative history; we set forth in our brief the various statements that were made on the floor of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.843" offset="3823803">The only response, I think it is fair to say, that respondents make is that they seek to answer our argument by misstating it.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.580" offset="3858807">They argue that Congress could never have intended this, because EPA’s position knows no rational bounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.643" offset="3890990">One might as well say that pollution from a factory results from State action through, for example, zoning decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.959" offset="3916276">I think that is the example they give at, if I'm not mistaken, Page 44 of their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.527" offset="3934562">But that ignores the fact that the factory, unlike the highway, sits on private land and if there is one thread running through the entire Clean Air Act, it is that the owner of a source of pollution is responsible, can be made responsible for controlling the pollution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1012.870" offset="4151901">Well, that may be; but the fact is that the States are the ones that have that highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.193" offset="4173217">States, like a private owner, are the ones that are allowing people to come on it and use it for a certain purpose, and as a result of that pollution is generated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.742" offset="4207385">It would be no different, for example, if the State owned a facility, a municipal incinerator, I suppose; but the State never operated it and invited a private contractor to come on and run the municipal incinerator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.898" offset="4260048">We think that the State in that situation could be regulated and required to control that private contractor, just like if the private contractor had been operating on his own property with his own factory spewing pollution into the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.849" offset="4315845">Now, they make another point in this regard with which we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.833" offset="4335803">They say the States are forced to comply with Federal law, because they have not exercised their police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.699" offset="4363284">I think that's accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.413" offset="4370076">But all that means is that we would not have Federal legislation under the Clean Air Act if the States had controlled air pollution, it can't mean anything more than that because, to use the example we've been talking about, if the State incinerator is poisoning the atmosphere, it is because the State has not exercised its police power in a way that Congress wanted the State to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.678" offset="4447189">Yet respondents admit that such facilities must comply with Federal pollution standards, air-pollution standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.134" offset="4476969">Now, this brings me to the point, I think, unless the Court has further questions, I probably should mention one thing which is not mentioned in our brief as far as the statutory point is concerned, and I informed respondents’ counsel of the fact that I may mention this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.121" offset="4568920">I think the appearance and the impression the Court may have is this whole idea of requiring States to comply under penalty of Federal law is something that was never talked about very much during the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.041" offset="4616671">That's not accurate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.970" offset="4624299">The reason we don't find great debates about that -- and I would like to remind the Court, the Clean Air Act passed the Senate 73 to nothing; it passed the House I think 347 to 1 -- the reason one doesn't find great debates about that, I think it's fair to say, is if the Court examines the hearings, the legislative history, what you'll find is that they're filled with statements from cities, from States, from governors, saying, “We need this legislation, we need tough legislation, we need demanding legislation, we need to be required to do these things”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.936" offset="4740178">The fact is, there wasn't very much opposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.710" offset="4751254">As a matter of fact, the only opposition I found from a State Representative -- and I have to give California credit for consistency -- is the statement of Governor Reagan on Page 1300 of the Senate hearings, where he objected to, as he put it, reserving for State and local governments the task and cost of implementing decisions of the Federal Government under threat of fines and punishment if the job is not done to the satisfaction of then-Secretary of HEW, but now EPA Administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.279" offset="4869537">Governor Reagan, I might add, added later on in his testimony that, “Yes, I do think, however, that interstate air-pollution regions would benefit from Federal overview to resolve disputes and to prevent inaction in one State imposing pollution problems on the people of a neighboring State”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.261" offset="4941530">That is at Page 1301 of his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.434" offset="4954174">We have 17 states and the District of Columbia in which pollution transportation controls have been required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.857" offset="4979878">I've counted up the cities which are either right on the border of a state or within 100 miles of the border of another state, and the number I get is somewhere between 75% and 85% of all the cities where the controls we are talking about here required are of that category, either right on the border of a state or at least within 100 miles of another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.118" offset="5060962">Now, I don't want to give the impression that Governor Reagan was the only governor to talk against this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.738" offset="5087398">I might add this, Douglas M. Head -- and this again is not cited in our brief -- who is the Attorney General of the State of Minnesota, testified on behalf of the National Associations of Attorneys General and stated at Page 1183 of the Senate hearings that, “If a state like my own state of Minnesota, has not adopted the motor-vehicle inspection law", and they still have not, "we would still" -- he was saying what kind of legislation he wanted -- “be pretty much compelled to install an inspection program for emission-control devices”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.634" offset="5230967">And without dragging this out too much further, the National Governors Conference, represented by Governor Sergeant of Massachusetts from Page 449 of the Senate hearings to Page 453, testified in favor of the legislation; and I think Governor Sergeant on behalf of the National Governors Conference said at the end of his testimony, “I think the States can't just shrug their shoulders and say, well, let the Federal Government do it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.513" offset="5326471">I submit to the Court that that is the position of the respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.067" offset="5348727">As far as the statute is concerned, I think we rest on solid grounds and in fact, the Fourth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit said that they were construing the statute only because of constitutional doubts that they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.417" offset="5398151">Well, let me address those constitutional doubts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1340.586" offset="5462830">So the Administrator establishes criteria for standards for ambient air, both primary and secondary pollution, and the State comes in with a plan that is found by the Administrator to be deficient insofar as it regulates municipally owned and operated incinerators in the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="3113.661" offset="12555075">Because they say, well, we want the Federal Government to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.851" offset="12567822">If it were essential to their continued existence, they would be making no such claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3613.084" offset="14552815">Your Honor, the citizen groups intervened in the court below in the District of Columbia Circuit in support of EPA because of their view, which we're glad to hear the Court shares, that the statute promotes for clean air and that the EPA regulations are the only practical way of achieving that important objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.472" offset="14638392">So to the statutory question, is it reasonable to regard a highway as a source of pollution, and Mr. Justice Stevens put it well in asking what is the specific statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.882" offset="14691996">What is it that talks about the State’s duty as a polluter of the atmosphere?</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.710" offset="14711326">Well, it is the same section which talks about any source’s duty, and that is the section which empowers EPA to promulgate regulations in the event that a State does not submit an adequate plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.049" offset="14760645">That section is Section 110(c) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.826" offset="14771721">It is set forth at EPA’s brief at Page 9A.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.045" offset="14792619">What it says is that the Administrator shall set forth, promptly prepare and publish proposed regulations setting forth an implementation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.123" offset="14828982">Now, that implementation plan must contain emission limitations, which although it doesn't say so in Section 110(a), are applicable to pollution sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.028" offset="14872554">The question then is, is it reasonable to regard a highway as a pollution source?</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.257" offset="14893452">I think the difficulty that many people have had is that the highway is owned by the States and, as such, it is difficult to perceive it as a pollution source.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.463" offset="14954369">So let's look at some similar types of sources which are owned by private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.996" offset="14972446">For example, let us take a garage which performs tune-ups on automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.831" offset="14995747">Those automobiles are owned by the individuals that bring those cars in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.689" offset="15015182">However, the idling emissions may be substantial, especially for very large garages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.415" offset="15038170">Similarly, a private garage which perhaps stores buses or is a bus terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.936" offset="15064188">The buses are owned by another party; but the garage itself may collect emissions, concentrate emissions and allow the problem to be created.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.651" offset="15111104">This is what a highway does, in that it determines the location of motor-vehicle activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.576" offset="15134719">It concentrates that motor-vehicle activity to a degree where the problem is created.</text>

            <text syncTime="3783.328" offset="15233775">Let's look at some others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.477" offset="15238373">Is a shopping center where people circulate, idling their cars for hours on end trying to find a parking space during a preholiday sale, is that a source of pollution; or is it fair for the shopping-center operator to insist that any community that adjoins the shopping center must go after the individual vehicles that circulate and are collected and are attracted to that shopping center?</text>

            <text syncTime="3864.142" offset="15557067">In the remaining moments, I'd like to just make two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.263" offset="15573471">First, it is logical to regard highways as sources of air pollution and, second, Congress intended that they be regarded as sources of air pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.640" offset="15615058">I'd like to touch on the second point first, Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.127" offset="15632926">I want to call the Justices’ attention to the fact that in 1974, after EPA promulgated the regulations here in issue, Congress considered amendments to the Clean Air Act in a Comprehensive Energy Bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3895.109" offset="15680887">Those amendments were passed in June of 1974, and one pertinent amendment is in the Government’s brief at Page 12A.</text>
            <text syncTime="3905.374" offset="15721951">It amended Section 110 of the Act to address EPA's authority to promulgate the very types of regulations here in issue, namely, bus lanes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3920.403" offset="15782033">Large Paragraph E on Page 12A specifies that basically no regulation relating to management of parking supply or preferential bus/carpool lanes shall be promulgated after the date of enactment of this paragraph unless there are locally conducted public hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3939.543" offset="15858624">So Congress addressed this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.283" offset="15865625">Its only concern about bus lanes was not that it was irrational to regard the highway as a source, but simply that there hadn't been adequate public participation in some of the bus lanes that had been promulgated up to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.752" offset="15915467">However, Congress didn't even require that those bus-lane regulations be rescinded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.775" offset="15935529">Instead, in the conference report, as is pointed out in the Government’s brief at Page 35, the conference report specifically endorsed the existing bus-lane regulations and simply required a procedural safeguard for future bus-lane regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3987.414" offset="16050154">In some respects, they removed EPA’s authority, that is, parking surcharges.</text>

            <text syncTime="4048.415" offset="16294138">So Congress knew what the issue was, and as I say, the only thing they did was act to limit EPA’s ability to promulgate new bus lanes by requiring some additional public hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="4060.892" offset="16344084">I would also like to point out that this is not all post-enactment legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="4065.373" offset="16361951">On the same day that the Clean Air Act was passed, the Clean Air Amendments of 1970, Congress also amended the Federal Aid Highway Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4072.434" offset="16390164">In 23 USC Section 109(j), which is referred to in our reply brief, Congress specified that all federal aid highways had to be consistent with air-quality implementation plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.440" offset="16438229">So, again, there is Congressional recognition that is coincident with the passage of the original amendments that a highway indeed can be a source of pollution.</text>

            <text syncTime="4103.774" offset="16515551">The Secretary of Transportation has promulgated regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4106.993" offset="16528404">We think they're inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.510" offset="16534464">The regulations provide that no future highway monies would be available to a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.413" offset="16566125">Just concluding with the logic of regarding highways or other vehicle facilities as sources, I'd would submit that Griggs v. Allegheny County, a decision of this Court, recognized that an airport is a source of pollution, noise pollution in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.524" offset="16630595">The planes were causing the noise pollution; but the airport owner, which in fact was a county, was held responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.121" offset="16656926">In cases involving interpretation of the Federal Railroad Safety Appliance Act, a railroad, not as the owner of vehicles, but merely as a track owner, was held liable in U.S. v. Toledo Railroad, which is in our brief at Page 8, was held liable for the safety defects in the cars owned and hauled by another railroad corporation and as I say, the basis of liability in that case and the basis of liability in the statute is that the person was a track owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="4169.091" offset="16776880">In this case, the State is also a track owner -- it happens to be a concrete track rather than a steel track and we think there's no constitutional significance in the fact that we have steel on rails in one case and rubber on concrete in another.</text>

            <text syncTime="4193.649" offset="16875101">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4196.877" offset="16887953">The Solicitor General has attempted to persuade this Court that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency has both statutory and constitutional authority to predetermine and control state transportation policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.556" offset="16938735">To prevail in this case, he's going to have to persuade the Court of the correctness of his position on both of these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.915" offset="16964126">I'm going to address myself to the statutory issues, and my colleague, Mr. Lord of Maryland, will discuss the constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="4225.126" offset="17001011">The Environmental Protection Agency in its latest position which it takes before this Court now seems to recognize that it may only regulate polluters; and to justify its attempt to regulate State policies and activities, it characterizes the States as polluters, because they own and maintain highways which, it is asserted, are indirect sources of pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="4250.966" offset="17104351">The notion of indirect source of pollution, I think, was developed somewhat more in EPA’s briefs than it was at oral argument, and I think perhaps we should give a little more attention to it here, because it is the slim thread upon which this entire statutory scheme is founded, the notion of indirect source; so we ought to step back a little bit and ask where this notion that a highway is an indirect source of pollution, precisely where does that come from.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.106" offset="17204871">The first thing you notice about the term "indirect source" is that it is not found anywhere in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4283.377" offset="17234023">Nowhere in the Clean Air Act do we read anything not only about a highway being an indirect source, but the term "indirect source" is not found in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.962" offset="17272267">The basis for the notion of indirect source at all, in fact, is submitted by EPA to be an essay by the Administrator as a preamble to some regulations, and this is the only basis we're given in the regulations for the concept of indirect source.</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.724" offset="17359411">Now, interestingly enough, there was in the regulations -- in fact, there still is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.837" offset="17379787">There is a regulation actually defining "indirect source", and you'll find it in the parking regulations, the one … they describe the present status of that regulation as its operation has now been suspended due, of course, to the interposition of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="4336.305" offset="17445720">Well, how far is your argument going along these lines?</text>
            <text syncTime="4339.207" offset="17457318">Is it your claim that there's no power to regulate any indirect source of air pollution?</text>

            <text syncTime="4346.013" offset="17484485">What we're trying to show now is the chain of reasoning by which it is established that a highway is an indirect source of pollution and that State policies with respect to those highways can be the proper subject of legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4359.230" offset="17537357">So what I'm demonstrating now is that starting with no concrete anchor in the statute, we are then given the concept of indirect source and how that concept has been utilized in this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="4839.987" offset="19460387">The point that we're trying to make here is that the concept of the highway as an indirect source is not statutorily grounded.</text>

            <text syncTime="4855.445" offset="19522245">But I think the point that I've made so far is that highways are at best an indirect indirect source.</text>
            <text syncTime="4860.808" offset="19543666">But as the sole authority for EPA’s application of its concept of indirect source makes plain, namely, the Administrator, it doesn't stop there with solely saying that the highway is an indirect source.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.902" offset="19608031">Rather, it uses the concept that the highway is a source of pollution as a springboard for its next step and the Administrator in his preface says that what he's concerned about is not so much the existence of highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="4889.322" offset="19657769">What he's concerned about is that the,“regulatory taxing and investment decisions made at all levels of government which encourage the use of highways by automobiles are also indirect sources”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4904.417" offset="19718164">He cites his indirect sources as particular examples: licensing vehicles and operators, providing a system of traffic laws, as well as not making choices which would have discouraged the use of single-passenger automobiles and encouraged the use of mass transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4921.266" offset="19785560">So there's a certain shift here from the physical objects which may attract someone to go in a mobile source of pollution, namely, a car, which as we indicated includes everything in the known universe.</text>
            <text syncTime="4934.547" offset="19838640">There's a shift to State policies which encourage the use of these automobiles as opposed to mass transit and State involvement not solely as an owner, because the owner concept is what's been stressed before this Court, but the focus as set forth by the Administrator himself when he came up with this idea is not the State as an owner, but the State as a regulatory taxing and investment maker, the provider of traffic laws.</text>

            <text syncTime="5011.300" offset="20145631">But there's a substantial difference between what the Administrator could do to that owner of the parking lot and what he's prepared to do vis-à-vis the States, because if he were to tell the owner of the parking lot shut down your parking lot.</text>

            <text syncTime="5089.898" offset="20460041">So I am concerned with the slippery slope, because if we accede to the concept you could ever regulate an indirect source and the Administrator has made everything an indirect source, then the conclusion we're logically drawn to is that he can regulate everything, and that's a position which the State vehemently does not wish to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="5107.834" offset="20531826">There may be some activities where the nexus of ownership is so close to the pollution that's generated that one could really say that the owner is causing the pollution in some meaningful way.</text>

            <text syncTime="5867.992" offset="23572479">No, the short answer is that we're not complaining so much at the subject matter of regulation, whether it be parking lots or highways or supermarkets or anything of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="5881.120" offset="23624933">Now, we are not conceding that it's in the statute, and I don't wish to be any more indefinite than I have to be; I'm simply not trying to commit myself on issues I haven't given sufficient thought to.</text>

            <text syncTime="5926.561" offset="23806745">I thought you said a while ago that there's no authority to regulate any indirect source.</text>
            <text syncTime="5932.819" offset="23831718">That was the one that I appeared to be waffling on, simply because I haven't explored all its parameters, because once one suggests any indirect source, then one gets into the Administrator’s regulation where everything is an indirect source and I'm not willing to concede that he can regulate everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="5946.858" offset="23887934">But the difference between a private highway operator doing this and the State doing this is that the private highway operator can't give tickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="5954.671" offset="23919176">He can't use any police power, any criminal sanctions, to force people to stay in that bus lane.</text>
            <text syncTime="5959.328" offset="23937775">I suppose he can say don’t you come back here anymore.</text>
            <text syncTime="5962.151" offset="23949060">But uniquely the State is the one that has to keep people in the bus lanes, and the way they do it is through enforcing the system of traffic laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="5970.445" offset="23982288">When the Administrator tells the State we demand you use your police power to ,“enforce our regulation”, to make that private conduct criminal under State law, that's the evil we're addressing here and that's what we're suggesting is nowhere to be found anywhere within the four corners of the Clean Air Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="6007.135" offset="24128991">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="6009.714" offset="24139336">The constitutional argument will attempt to track the most recent metamorphoses of the EPA position as reflected in the two briefs and in the argument this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="6023.246" offset="24193462">While the shift in position of EPA, contrary to its statement, has been desperate and radical, the outcome does not change, and the effect upon the States possibly is even more intrusive than with the regulations which were presented to the Circuit Courts on petitions by the party states.</text>
            <text syncTime="6047.824" offset="24291787">I think perhaps the way to demonstrate the difference would be to turn to Appendix A of the brief that we describe as Sovereign Gold, and that's Pages 1a through 3a.</text>
            <text syncTime="6067.176" offset="24369214">We have set out there an illustrative inspection and maintenance program.</text>
            <text syncTime="6074.088" offset="24396799">It happens to be the one that was mandated for the State of Maryland.</text>
            <text syncTime="6080.224" offset="24421354">Now, bear in mind that in the Metropolitan Baltimore Intrastate Air Quality Control Region, there are approximately 1.1 million private vehicles, light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles.</text>
            <text syncTime="6097.611" offset="24490944">I suppose the number increases as much as sevenfold when you move into the Los Angeles Air Quality Control Region.</text>
            <text syncTime="6105.748" offset="24523440">Now, looking at the regulation on the first page, when this becomes a Federal regulation in all its particulars as described by Mr. Randolph this morning, the essential change in Page 1a will be instead of saying, "The State of Maryland shall establish" at the bottom of the page "an inspection and maintenance program", it will say, "The State of Maryland shall carry out a Federal inspection and maintenance program".</text>
            <text syncTime="6137.763" offset="24651545">We haven't seen these new regulations, so all we can do is surmise as to what they may contain; but this would seem to be logically following from the positions stated in the briefs and in argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6147.591" offset="24690833">At the top of Page 2a in the fourth line, "The State will no longer have any power to exempt any category of vehicles", and I'm sure that any exemptions that exist would be Federal exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="6161.102" offset="24744854">The business about "the State shall submit within a particular time period legally adopted regulations" would no longer be necessary, because the Federal regulations would speak for themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="6172.141" offset="24789054">Now, all of the operative provisions, which would be Provisions (c)1 through 6 on 2A, (d) and (e) at the top of Page 3A, would become Federal regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6187.560" offset="24850702">Reading down there, you can see that in 2 there is a standard set.</text>
            <text syncTime="6192.662" offset="24871078">That's one of the things EPA says it has a right to do, set a standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="6197.006" offset="24888528">It doesn't help you very much.</text>
            <text syncTime="6199.476" offset="24898350">It's a little like saying to a first-grade teacher you shall pass only 70% of the students on to the second grade without telling the teacher what sort of expectations as far as the learning experience should be instilled in that student.</text>
            <text syncTime="6219.933" offset="24980165">It says that 30% of vehicles shall be failed, it happens to be 50% of the vehicles in some of the California Districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6230.118" offset="25020916">The frequency of inspection is stated in 1, and this again would be a new Federal regulation, it says that all vehicles, all 1.1 million vehicles, will have to be inspected periodically no more than one year apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="6245.092" offset="25080789">So that's the standard and the frequency.</text>
            <text syncTime="6247.681" offset="25091238">We also have a frequency provision down in 5 at the bottom of the page that the first inspection cycle shall be in a year that expired during the time that this case was being considered by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="6260.718" offset="25143378">Now, those would be the new Federal regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="6306.868" offset="25327907">The statement has been made by EPA and again made here this morning that they would be withdrawn and recast in this new way and I appreciate Justice Powell’s problem, because frankly the States have had the same problem trying to prepare for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6321.699" offset="25387258">Now, as far as sanctions are concerned, I think we can begin to see the intrusive nature of this new approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="6332.509" offset="25430516">If you look at 3, it says, "These shall include"that would be these provisions "sanctions against individual owners and repair facilities, retest of failed vehicles following maintenance" and then another sanction is for people who disconnect devices between the licensing year.</text>
            <text syncTime="6352.089" offset="25508779">Bear in mind that in Maryland, for example, the licensing year for a vehicle is April 1 of this year till March 31st of the following year.</text>
            <text syncTime="6360.643" offset="25543052">There is no safety-inspection program, so this would be a brand-new program.</text>
            <text syncTime="6365.031" offset="25560606">The only safety inspection in Maryland, for example, is when a vehicle changes hands; a used cars is sold, it has to be inspected.</text>

            <text syncTime="6376.857" offset="25607940">The great majority, it is in EPA’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6379.458" offset="25618285">I think EPA says between five and ten States have some sort of an annual safety program.</text>
            <text syncTime="6385.429" offset="25642213">I think Virginia does, Maryland does not happen to have one and so it's obvious here that despite what EPA would like to have this Court believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="6394.541" offset="25678680">The sanction here is not merely a licensing sanction on an annual basis, the theory being, I suppose, that because the State licenses already, it's not really very much to ask the State to conduct its licensing affairs in a different way.</text>
            <text syncTime="6409.635" offset="25738970">There will have to be interim sanctions against violators.</text>
            <text syncTime="6412.868" offset="25751927">Presumably, those will be criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="6416.102" offset="25764884">If someone has been inspected on a Monday and told within two weeks that he must bring his vehicle into compliance, does not, there has to be an interim sanction there.</text>
            <text syncTime="6427.796" offset="25811695">It could be a de-licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6429.349" offset="25817860">I suspect that if what he does the second time is to disconnect the devices he's placed upon his car, most likely a criminal sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6438.263" offset="25853491">Where is the source of it?</text>
            <text syncTime="6439.363" offset="25857880">The source is going to have to be this new Federal regulation, because Maryland does not happen to have any legislation on that subject and at this point has not had any reason to have any legislation on the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="6450.865" offset="25903960">So I think it's much too seductive an argument to suggest that legislation is not inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="6458.006" offset="25932485">This program will be one that will have to be managed by a group of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="6467.959" offset="25972296">Now, we've had the helpful suggestion from EPA that we can contact this out and maybe even make money on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6474.395" offset="25998000">I don't know that the states have to adopt the suggestions made by Counsel.</text>

            <text syncTime="6507.227" offset="26129344">The whole budget-making program, I suppose, could be leased out to an accounting firm; but it seems to me that one of the essences of sovereignty is that the states continue to have the options available to them as to whether this will be done or whether it won't be done, and to suggest that everything is foreclosed to a state except the option of hiring someone to carry out the program I think by its own terms is intrusive enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="6534.898" offset="26240103">Now, when you look at the constitutional framework of this and bear in mind, we also have had another gracious concession by EPA that despite the clear language of Section 113, this Administrator at least will not seek criminal sanctions against states for violations here.</text>
            <text syncTime="6553.894" offset="26316067">Despite the fact that there's a $25,000-a-day fine and a one-year-in-jail per-day fine or both, that this Administrator has decided that he won't seek that against states.</text>
            <text syncTime="6565.424" offset="26362147">Now, that's somewhat reassuring, but hardly puts the case to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="6570.660" offset="26383150">Obviously, the injunctive remedies here could be very difficult for states to live with.</text>

            <text syncTime="6703.526" offset="26914585">Correct, Your Honor and turning to that, first of all, there is an irony that after describing this new Federal program, we find that the only way that the Federal Government has gotten to the point of having authority to do it is through the mechanism of a prior finding several years ago that the States didn't have sufficient authority to do this themselves, that they had not presented enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="6729.383" offset="27018030">So the States were told and we're all told back in 1973 that they had not produced enough authority to carry out the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="6738.235" offset="27053452">That was the exciting cause, if you will, of the intrusion of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="6742.734" offset="27071424">Now, we're told that these regulations have been withdrawn and that there's been inherent Federal authority all along to do this through Federal regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6751.365" offset="27105906">Now, the point was brought up by Justice Stevens about a swarm of Federal officials coming into the states and perhaps being more intrusive if not in a constitutional sense, in a governmental sense, than what we are opposing today.</text>
            <text syncTime="6772.284" offset="27189602">That, I can only say, is a possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="6777.190" offset="27209246">Apparently, the Federal Government, perhaps based on the Prohibition experience, has decided that that is not what it wants to do, that it will not take that issue on.</text>
            <text syncTime="6789.533" offset="27258565">We don't know why and we haven't been informed; but our position constitutionally is, just as Mr. Mascowitz said, that the Federal Government has ample authority to take this program over itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6801.293" offset="27305690">In fact, I would go so far as to say that the Federal Government could preempt this entire program, carry it out through Federal funds and Federal employees and by a notice some time prior to the licensing expiration period in a state notify a state that X vehicle is not yet in compliance and the state would then have to use in that limited intrusion its licensing function to not issue a state license.</text>
            <text syncTime="6834.038" offset="27436616">We happen to feel that that would not be so intrusive as to be constitutionally violative.</text>

            <text syncTime="6917.548" offset="27770670">Now, I think it's interesting that the EPA has said to this Court this morning that no constitutional source was cited for the 1973 regulations and all of these regulations and this whole theory was conceived of in the latter half of 1973, within 10 months after EPA lost NRDC v. EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="6943.562" offset="27874742">That's simply not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6945.372" offset="27881951">In fact, right in the preamble to the Administrator’s theories, which have been discussed at length today, is a citation to United States v. California as the authority for what it is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="6958.736" offset="27935450">In fact, US v. California was so appealing to EPA that in its brief in chief, United States v. California was cited four times.</text>
            <text syncTime="6969.773" offset="27979545">The United States v. California decision is really more helpful to the States than it is to the EPA and the reason for that is that in the California case, there was a railroad owned by the State of California that connected 45 State-owned wharves in San Francisco with a bunch of industrial users some distance away at an interstate railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="6997.010" offset="28088528">It charged for the service, just like any private railroad would have; and as such, the Court found that there was no valid distinction between what California was doing and what a private railroad was doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="7014.516" offset="28158536">What we have here is the support for our conclusion that State facilities are in no way exempted from the Clean Air Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="7025.376" offset="28202004">In fact, State facilities are included; but it's not the type of State facility that EPA would urge this Court to include.</text>
            <text syncTime="7033.157" offset="28233142">It would be if the State did own an incinerator, which it doesn't, that's a traditionally municipal function, or a sewage treatment plant, which it doesn't -- again a traditionally local or municipal function, those would be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="7048.449" offset="28294268">The most obvious example and the perfect parallel to United States v. California is the State auto fleet.</text>
