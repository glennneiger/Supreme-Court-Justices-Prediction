            <text syncTime="15.330" offset="161757">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.558" offset="170743">My name is Danny Evans, I am an Assistant Attorney General for the State of Alabama, counsel for the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.517" offset="194567">My co-counsel with me is today is Mr. Eric Bowen, also of our Attorneys General’s office.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.073" offset="220794">The facts of the case are basically these: This case presents an appeal from a Three-Judge ruling of the Middle District of Alabama striking down both the State Statute and an administrative regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.956" offset="272307">The case started as two consolidated class actions, both challenging different areas of Alabama Law on constitutional grounds, as well as statutory grounds under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.147" offset="321104">This appeal pertains only to the part of the order would struck down a height/weight requirement and a prison regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.497" offset="358511">The class that is affected by this order challenged a 5 foot 2, 120 pound, minimum height/weight requirement that is included in an Alabama Statute for law enforcement officers included, under that statute, our prison guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.527" offset="426534">The action also challenged, although the plaintiff representative was not an employee, an administrative regulation of the Alabama Board of Correction which prevented guards of opposite sections working in contact position within penitentiaries in Alabama with inmates of opposite sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.688" offset="503230">The court below found in regard to the statute that the height/weight minimums on the basis of 1960 statistical survey have a disproportional impact on women, and in that regard and on that basis solely they we found it to be a prima facie discriminatory under Title VII and enjoined its further application.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.223" offset="585359">In regard to the Regulation the court made no finding of the prima facie showing of discrimination but merely present it to be discriminatory and evidently, explicitly due to its application of the bona fide occupational qualification of the defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="159.912" offset="740108">That is all, Your Honor, just exactly that, and that is one of the grievances we bring to this Court is that the Court look to merely 14-year old statistics representing women between the ages of 18 and 79 in Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.912" offset="792144">Now, certainly they could affect judicial knowledge of those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.933" offset="804160">There was no restriction -- you will found this on Page 32 of the jurisdiction statement -- there is no restriction as to the number of age brackets that would even be considered for the job or the number of the people which worked actually in the labor market itself, and certainly there was no finding as to the applicants, as this Court stated it should be in Albemarle.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.047" offset="888693">Now, there are several issues before the Court by this appeal but due to the time limitations I intend to address only three.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.242" offset="917427">From notification of the clerk he indicated that the Court would be interested in hearing a jurisdictional issue on the providence of this appeals as the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.299" offset="957656">Now, certainly the Court knows that probable jurisdiction was noted on November 29 but since at time the AFL-CIO filed an amicus brief challenging some aspects of jurisdiction, and we are prepared to argue that today.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.408" offset="1010110">Second issue, and we contend should be addressed by the Court, is the applicability of Title VII to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.933" offset="1048248">In addition to that issue we intend to argue to the correct interpretation of the bona fide occupational qualification.</text>

            <text syncTime="270.370" offset="1181995">Returning to the first issue of jurisdiction and the providence of this appeal tell us contend a course that the court noted probable jurisdiction properly on November 29th.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.404" offset="1222119">The grievance of the AFL-CIO as amicus is that basically since Title VII which he used as the grounds for the part of the order and since it could have been used under their assumptions or the entirety of the order then the case should not properly be here as no constitutional finding was made by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.988" offset="1308428">At the outset we would point out the key facts of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.079" offset="1320758">The complaint of the consolidated class action challenged Alabama Statutes and regulations on statutory and constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.266" offset="1357538">Every statute that was brought in was challenged on constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.226" offset="1373421">The Three-Judge Court ordered that pertaining to the Highway Troopers which is not before us was based solely on constitutional grounds, was a complete 1983 action having nothing to do with Title VII.</text>

            <text syncTime="448.798" offset="1895661">The merits of the claim were reached in this case too, and in fact one of the statutes was enjoined explicitly on the basis of constitutionality as well as a statutory question, and we feel it would be improper for the Court to ignore that determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.107" offset="1948950">We also feel that that would be improper for the Court to feel that a Title VII allegation makes insubstantial allegation of denial of the equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.738" offset="1987403">This Court recently in Philbrook versus Glodgett found that even if a court is properly convened and reaches the merits of the case, even if the final ruling is based totally on statutory grounds then that case should be on the direct appeal to this Court, and we feel that it is properly lie here.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.072" offset="2064725">The allegation that Title VII makes insubstantial, the constitutional allegation, we feel is remiss with many interpretations of the Three-Judge appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.392" offset="2118015">Hagens v. Lavine a recent case by this Court indicated that that would be the most judicial efficienct with method of dealing with the -- statutory and constitutional claim were presented for the single judge to take the statutory claim, decide it, then take the constitutional claim if necessary and convene a Three-Judge Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.652" offset="2191053">Now, the several problems we see with that type of method -- but at outset I would point out in this particular case dealing with equal protection and dealing with a Title VII equal employment claim, the gravenment of the complaint in each is identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.671" offset="2251135">The method of proof in both will be very similar.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.273" offset="2265555">The judicial efficiency therefore in that regard would be almost nil of requiring that one judge to determine a statutory claim and then possibly changing the rate of an appeal for one party and then reconvening a Three-Judge Panel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1024.425" offset="4198198">Nevertheless even if this Court should find that Title VII is applicable and should also find as the court below evidently assume that it is prima facie discriminatory, we feel that the facts below justify the defense with bona fide occupational qualification.</text>

            <text syncTime="1051.596" offset="4306867">But if the bona fide occupational qualification is to be given anything more than an imaginary existence, certainly the facts of this case warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.657" offset="4339050">The facts surrounding the regulation are these: The regulation was promulgated by the Board of Corrections of Alabama only after the solicited advice of the General Counsel for the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.508" offset="4386488">It is not arbitrary, it does not just leave, get up to the open discretion, sets forth several criteria to be used in determining whether a contact position within a penitentiary should be subject to requiring a guard of alike sex with inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.351" offset="4445839">It is limited only to contact positions and limited only to penitentiaries.</text>

            <text syncTime="1100.479" offset="4502368">The contact position in Alabama Your Honor, within the brief on Page 50 they are laid out, they have certain five criteria that deal with the position -- that define it as a regulation be it basically whether they would be in direct contact with inmates of opposite sex without anyone else around and requiring invasions of privacy, no other protection so forth as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.846" offset="4599857">Now, in reference to the justifiability of this particular regulation, we would point out some peculiarities about Alabama system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.675" offset="4631204">The penitentiaries in Alabama are open dormitories, they are not single cell occupied, they have open communal toilets to allow open view into the penitentiaries by patrolling guards, we have multiple offenders only in Alabama penitentiaries, we have other facilities that house first offenders in use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.709" offset="4703302">20% of the population are sex offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.715" offset="4719288">We have farming operation at, at least, two of the four facilities that require extensive strip searching and path searching and guards are used interchangeably in all the positions in the prison for several reasons to promote their familiarity with institutions and also because of the shortage of manpower.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.323" offset="4789715">Now, the State of Alabama is not intending any type of discrimination for women in regard to its use in females or males in contact positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.858" offset="4839870">The state has been using women in minimum security institutions since 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.943" offset="4868291">They have used them in work-release centers, in youth facilities, and we have encountered several difficulties in those facilities but nevertheless the overriding considerations of equal employment opportunity, we have used them in those facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.047" offset="4932657">The Board of Corrections, it is our contention, in promulgating Regulation 204 deals with real contacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.630" offset="4962959">They cannot assume that inmates within the State of Alabama penitentiaries view every individual where equal protections lies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.859" offset="4991902">They are dealing with the stereotypes that are perceived by the inmates within Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.118" offset="5016980">They have certain goals they must make sure the institution are secured, they must make sure have control of it, they must make sure that the inmates are safe and that their employees are safe, and these require realistic appraisal of the facts before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.166" offset="5073091">We feel that the record below of dealing with the Commissioner Lott's deposition who is commissioner of our Board of Corrections, recognizing the sexual stereotypes, the innate attraction of multiple offenders who have been long incarcerated to a female’s presence or vice versa are necessary and realistic concerns, and that these certainly justify the Regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.878" offset="5171938">The evidence that was proposed to the contrary below does little we feel to impeach that the experts that were testified, starting with Mr. Nelson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.781" offset="5207569">Mr. Nelson is the director of a minimum security institution in Chicago, and that institution houses persons with less than a year to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.428" offset="5242155">They have been using women there for six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.778" offset="5251559">It is the single cell institutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.255" offset="5265457">They toilets are not communal, they are divided off and the inmate staff ratio was considerably less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.283" offset="5297639">That primarily is the fact of the type of institution that we are dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.025" offset="5320523">Now, from his six months appraisal he said they have been good that we reviews that but he admitted that the federal system of which he is a part does not use women in the penitentiaries in contact positions and for obvious reason that we feel are adequately proposed today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.504" offset="5382485">Mr. Sarba (ph) the other expert before the court below had never supervised women in any penitentiary, although he had been warden of two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.524" offset="5414564">He had never known of any such situation of women being in contact positions in penitentiaries, but nevertheless he was sure that they would be very capable and would add to the normalization of the prison system, but we feel that this is simply not credible evidence to impeach the correctly promulgated Regulations of the State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1597.771" offset="6491540">The Appellee’s position is simply that under its prior holding in Locomotive Engineers versus Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad, this Court clearly has jurisdiction of this appeal under 1253 and as recently as 1975 in Philbrook v. Glodgett, this Court refused to reconsider the Engineers doctrine, and I would submit that there is no reason for that doctrine to be reconsidered now.</text>

            <text syncTime="3114.887" offset="12559994">If it is not pleaded, since it is the burden on the defendants that ends the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3145.179" offset="12681202">Again, I would concede it is permissible that there are privacy needs, which the prison administrators rightly should concern themselves with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.696" offset="12715266">Our position, however, is that the State failed to prove that Regulation 204 was necessary to the achievement of this objective, because the evidence is clear that the sexual aspects of the job, which are basically strip searches, can be separated from the non-sexual aspects, and the State attempted to offer no reason at all why it could not achieve its objective, as the District Court suggested, that is by selective work responsibilities as opposed to the total exclusion of women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.453" offset="12870328">Indeed we are dealing primarily with the four male penitentiaries and the evidence reflected that in two of these facilities no systematic strip searches are conducted, and in the other two, less than 25% of the workforce is involved in systematic care.</text>

            <text syncTime="3375.840" offset="13603847">May it please the Court, I have a few things to state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.167" offset="13617117">I did not mean to imply Justice Marshall that the prison in Chicago is a first offender institution, it is multiple offended, that what I stated, I believe was that they all have less than a year to serve and it is single cell and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.890" offset="13672079">The State did try to make selective work responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.149" offset="13685035">That was a whole promulgation, the whole reason behind Regulation 204 is to assign women in male prisons where they could be used and still meet the needs of the State and to assign males in the women prisons where they could be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.147" offset="13741042">Now, we use them in the youth centers and in the work release centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.444" offset="13758283">As our youth centers, the boys or first offenders, non valid inmates have got less than ten years to serve, and they are going to school during the day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.382" offset="13794018">At the work release centers, all the inmates are gone during the day to jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.076" offset="13808751">There is certainly no patrolling situation like here in the penitentiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.009" offset="13836546">I would like to address briefly the prima facie showing against the height and weight statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.437" offset="13866221">The only thing was shown in this case was some census figures that were taken in 1960 about women between the ages of 18 and 79.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.408" offset="13902061">There was no attempt whatsoever to show women in the Alabama workforce, they were eligible for employment as prison guards, no attempt whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.032" offset="13936647">We feel that the Court could have taken judicial knowledge of this and this is certainly not sufficient to show and the challenge to the state statute is being prima facie discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.868" offset="13975935">In Griggs the Court did find a statistical disparity plus a past practice of over racial discrimination made out a prima facie case of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.452" offset="14026299">We do not have any past practice here, we do not have any over discrimination in the past, there is nothing shown by some census figures, and we certainly contend that the Griggs decision is limited by those circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3524.815" offset="14199752">Justice Marshall questioned earlier about the widespread use of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.769" offset="14215530">A Lawyer View Article which we cited in brief, there had been some investigation of that and found that 47 of the 50 largest police forces is in the country do use those, and we are unaware of any state troop force in the country that does not use some type of height/weight requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.076" offset="14276761">As far as drawing the line which I believe Mr. Chief Justice mentioned earlier, this job is not like an airline job where you can tell if the person is so many inches long then he can reach to the paddles in the controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3555.002" offset="14320438">This is a job which has a peculiar function, the duties are unpredictable, there is high risk involved and there in a maximum amount of state responsibility both to the inmates as well as the population which surrounds the prisons, and the whole of the State is such a rigid standard or to a mathematical certainty to have to say that a person 5’2”, 120 pounds can always do the job, whereas a person 5’2” 115 pounds can never do the job, we feel that is certainly unjustified and in a derogation of the Tenth Amendment.</text>
