            <label>Mr. Arthur B. Hanson</label>
            <text syncTime="15.218" offset="161367">Mr. Justice Brennan, distinguished associate justices, may it please at the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.684" offset="191251">National Geographic Society appears before the Court today to ask that this Court reverse the decision of the Supreme Court of California, handed down on April 1, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.580" offset="250810">That decision represents the farthest reach in asserted use tax collection liability by any State Supreme Court, since this Court struck down the decision of the Supreme Court of Illinois in National Bellas Hess against Department of Revenue in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.864" offset="323953">The test for asserted use tax collection liability set forth in the Supreme Court of California’s opinion is that the slightest presence within such taxing state, without regard to the nature of such presence, is enough for a liability to attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.366" offset="393961">This proffered test geodetically created in California as “No genesis” in the jurisprudence related to this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.690" offset="435235">Nor has any state legislature or the Federal Congress ever attempted to assert legislatively such a clear cut violation of the Commerce Clause of the constitution, as set forth in Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3, of the Constitution of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.871" offset="516005">Likewise, the California decision is an egregious violation of the Due Process Clause of the federal constitution, as set forth in the Fourteenth Amendment to the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.929" offset="564175">This Court has specifically addressed the subject in this field in Wisconsin against J.C. Penney Company, referred to at pages 3, 4 and 8 of the society’s reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.653" offset="607121">In saying, “a state is free to pursue its own fiscal policies unembarrassed by the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.869" offset="639930">If by the practical operation of a tax, the state has exerted its power in relation to opportunities which it has given, to protection it has afforded, the benefits which it has conferred by the fact of being an orderly civilized society.”</text>
            <text syncTime="152.677" offset="711192">In all cases decided by this Court upholding the sales-related taxing authority of states, there has been meaningful instate exploitation of that state’s resident customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.272" offset="765632">Such instate customer exploitation is clearly a benefit which satisfies the due process requirements of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.396" offset="806069">The California Court of Appeal, First District also stated the relationship requirements succinctly in 1969 in the case of Montgomery Ward and Company against State Board of Equalization, referred to at pages 16 and 22 of the society’s jurisdictional statement, page 22 of the society’s brief, and page 3 of the society’s reply brief, where the California Appeals Court said, “The protection afforded and the benefits conferred must have some relationship to the transaction which the state seeks to burden.”</text>
            <text syncTime="212.976" offset="952355">It is interesting to note that the Supreme Court of California refused to hear this case in 1969 and this Court denied certiorari in this very case in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.244" offset="1001465">This same question was raised in the instant case and most properly answered by the California Court of Appeal, First District, where in 1975, it stated in pertinent part “What did the state of California give in relation to the out of state sales, that the state can ask a return by way of requiring the society to collect the use taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.418" offset="1094147">The answer is that the state provided no protections or benefits which were related to the out of state sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.007" offset="1124554">All parts of the transactions were conducted through the federal mail with the state playing no part, and providing no benefits or protections.</text>

            <text syncTime="597.423" offset="2490236">Some 45 states and the District of Columbia require out of state sellers to collect use taxes on sales made to the residents of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.706" offset="2527330">As has also been pointed out, there has been no uniformity in the state’s statutes on this subject and the Federal Congress has not yet enacted a uniform Sales and Use Tax Act, although extensive hearings have been held.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.203" offset="2581351">Both the state and we have referred to those hearings in parts of our brief and in part of our reply brief, thus the only protection for the society and others similarly affected is to rely on the federal constitution and this, the highest court of our land.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.860" offset="2647911">The exact language of the test, California would have this Court adopt as this follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="642.400" offset="2670063">Where an out of state seller conducts substantial mail order businesses with the residents of a state, imposing a use tax on such purchasers and the seller’s connection with the tax instate is not exclusively by means of the instruments of the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.706" offset="2743310">The slightest presence within such tax in state, independent of any connection through interstate commerce, will permit the state constitutionally to impose on the seller, the duty of collecting the use tax from such mail order purchasers and the liability for payer to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.155" offset="2821155">To us, this proposed test is a little short of ludicrous.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.873" offset="2835992">Does this mean that if the society sends a writer and a photographer to California, that the state could impose use tax collection liability based on their presence in the state?</text>
            <text syncTime="696.225" offset="2885416">Suppose, a writer is a resident of California and submits a story to the society which is accepted for publication, does that make the society liable?</text>
            <text syncTime="706.274" offset="2925645">The answer should be resoundingly “no.”</text>
            <text syncTime="709.348" offset="2937870">Yet, the state might well argue to the contrary where this proposed test to be permitted to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.205" offset="2961276">We used an example in our reply brief of the society owning a parking lot in California, not operating, merely owning it.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.660" offset="2995130">Under the state’s view of this case, that would immediately attach us to use tax liability, although there is absolutely no connection between that and the sales that are discussed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.189" offset="3049256">This Court must face the real test of use tax collection liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.091" offset="3068900">This is the first case before this Court, where a state court has asserted that a non-sales related presence in a state, that is one that has no connection with or relationship to any sales whatsoever, will justify a position of use tax collection liability on interstate sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.122" offset="3156985">Neither the state nor anyone else can point with a single case where such liability has attached absence on direct retail, sales-related activity in the state.</text>

            <text syncTime="1466.747" offset="5967447">In effect, the magazine was the society’s catalog and the difference between it and Bellas Hess is that Bellas Hess had a catalog with about 5,000 items advertised in it in a typical mail order house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.622" offset="6018961">In the two exhibits in the record here, the society had a three quarter page ad in one issue and a quarter page ads in another and they do not advertise these goods in each one of the magazines that put out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.807" offset="6079774">In light of these facts, it is difficult to understand how the state of California reached the conclusion it did, unless it believed that the need for revenue at the state level is assumed to be as all important, as eluded to by the brief of the state of New York as Amicus Curiae in support of the state of California.</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.812" offset="6471715">Starting with Connecticut General Life Insurance Company in 1928, cited by the Amicus in support on pages 8 and 9 of its brief, Norton Company in 1951 and American Oil Company in 1965, this Court has consistently refused to assess tax liability where the instate activities were held to be dissociated from the activities generating the asserted tax liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.185" offset="6593236">The basic flaw in the Supreme Court of California’s opinion was pointed out on pages 27 and 28 of the society’s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.500" offset="6622494">The California Court tried to justify its whole lien by misstating the language in National Bellas Hess.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.909" offset="6648094">That case clearly stands for the proposition that there must be instate contacts with the customers before there can be a use tax collection liability for mail-order sales and that a totally non-sales related contact by the out-of-state seller with the state will not suffice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1882.040" offset="7628626">Accordingly, it is most respectfully urged that the decision of the Supreme Court of California be reversed and the decision of the California Court of Appeal be reinstated with whatever reinforcement this Honorable Court deems is appropriate.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip M. Plant</label>
            <text syncTime="1900.985" offset="7704485">Mr. Justice Brennan and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.568" offset="7718801">The appellant has referred repeatedly to the opinion of the California State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.501" offset="7746490">I respectfully submit that we are here before this Court, on the facts of this case and it should be viewed in that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.026" offset="7780658">On the facts of this case, the issue before this Court pertains to the constitutionality of the California statute which imposes a use tax collection requirement on a foreign retailer having a place of business within the taxing jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.239" offset="7853488">This is not unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.359" offset="7861952">The 1965 special subcommittee on state taxation of interstate commerce found that from 7 to 23 of the 36 sales tax states then reporting to its survey, had similar provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.571" offset="7938752">Also, following this 1965 report, there were repeated attempts and introductions of bills in the Congress to regulate the state taxation of commerce among the several states and none of which passed, but all of which bills provided that the ownership or leasing a property within the taxing jurisdiction would support the imposition of a use tax in collection requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.805" offset="8059751">As Mr. Hanson has said, there are two constitutional challenges to the statue, the Due Process and the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.529" offset="8098621">Both of these provisions are based on principles of fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.461" offset="8118370">The interstate Commerce Clause is satisfied if the state tax in question does not constitute an undue burden upon the commerce among the several states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.751" offset="8167480">The Due Process Clause is satisfied if the state has given something for which it can ask return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.587" offset="8194856">That is if the benefits given and the opportunities conferred bear a fiscal relation to the exertion of taxing powered by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.488" offset="8242503">We submit that the requirement of the presence of a business office within the taxing jurisdiction as a condition precedent to the requirement of a foreign retailer collecting a use tax satisfies both of these tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.984" offset="8304466">Firstly, it does not constitute an undue burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.976" offset="8324423">At the outset, it is appropriate to note that the purpose of the use tax is not to discriminate against the foreign retailer, but rather to place the foreign retailer under a tax equal in amount to that borne by the local retailer who is subject to the sales tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2096.159" offset="8485129">In that situation, the relationship is such that under analogy to Scripto, we might as well assert a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.642" offset="8527029">We might say that the solicitation of the advertising supports a magazine which in turn is a primary vehicle through which the society advertised its offerings of maps, atlases, globes and books.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.420" offset="8578229">Moreover, it constituted the mailing list used by the society in soliciting these mail-order sales to California residents and finally, the good will established by the prestige of the society’s name carried over to enhance its sales of these maps, atlases, globes and books.</text>

            <text syncTime="2247.163" offset="9089184">We consider them relevant in the two particulars, You Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.915" offset="9104126">In the first instance, we consider them relevant because we feel they are not de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.176" offset="9125233">We feel that to the extent, they overlap the first taxable quarter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.038" offset="9140698">They constitute approximately 2.3% of the taxes during that particular time when the over-the-counter sales overlap with the mail-order sales here disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.812" offset="9199734">That is 2.3% which we think more than de minimis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.613" offset="9214990">Furthermore, we noticed that in the second quarter, after they discontinued over-the-counter sales, their mail-order sales dropped off from 45,000 to 38,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.615" offset="9250934">So we say, there might be some significance to that and we take the position that there should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.891" offset="9272041">Secondly, the fact that they made over-the-counter sales is very material to the question of whether or not they were registered to do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2302.692" offset="9311225">We submit as one of our arguments that they did in fact by stipulation, do business in California and that they should not be rewarded for their failure to register by having a more restrictive liability in regard to use tax collections.</text>

            <text syncTime="2412.942" offset="9752276">As I earlier noted, the purpose of the use tax is that of competitive parody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.152" offset="9781116">Next, I think we should consider the holding of this Court in National Bellas Hess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.870" offset="9803999">In that court, they found a violation of due process and a violation of the Commerce Clause in a purely mail order situation that is to say where the foreign retailers’ only contacts with the taxing jurisdiction were through the use of the US mails and common carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.145" offset="9865125">Now, the Court in considering the Commerce Clause, Brown, made reference to the fact that if a interstate mail order retailer had to file a separate return at a different rate under different administrative requirements in every state, political subdivision, local county and school district, that there would result an administrative entanglement, which would constitute and undue burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.112" offset="9988946">In the instant situation, we are only seeking to impose a use tax collection requirement on a foreign retailer maintaining a place of business within our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.455" offset="10034294">Now, the 1965 special subcommittee on state taxation of interstate commerce specifically concluded that the vast majority of mail order retailers have business offices only in two or fewer states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.754" offset="10099496">For this reason, there would not result the administrative entanglement productive of the undue burden condemned in National Bellas Hess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.337" offset="10141814">Moreover, we should note that California has a centralized collection procedure, whereby its local use taxes are collected by the state so there is only one collector.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.490" offset="10226451">Turning to the due process clause as noted earlier it would ask no more than a fair return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.016" offset="10252574">We feel that conditioning the imposition of the use tax collection liability upon the maintenance of a place of business within California meets that test because by maintaining places of business, the foreign retailer necessarily, substantially draws upon the benefits conferred and opportunities given by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.084" offset="10340867">In this regard, it is interesting to compare the Standard Pressed Steel Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.078" offset="10360825">In the Standard Pressed Steel Case, they found sufficient nexus to support the collection of a $33,000.00 tax liability on the basis of one engineering consultant who worked out of his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.707" offset="10415369">If that meets a due process test with regard to the question of state opportunities and benefits conferred, then surely, the maintenance of two-employee staffed advertising offices in California would do likewise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.367" offset="10481929">There are also benefits that do accrue to a foreign retailer purely by virtue of mail-order sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.947" offset="10516306">Now, while it is true that National Bellas Hess held that that alone is insufficient, it nevertheless is note worthy that the Court in General Trading Company did observe that the foreign retailer doing a mail order business benefits by virtue of the fact that the state protection makes possible, the California purchaser’s use of the product, which is a sine-qua-non of the sale itself, therefore, there is that benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.351" offset="10649948">Further, there is a benefit that the California facilities are available to the foreign retailer if as here, there is a possible credit sale problem where they need to collect delinquent accounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.128" offset="10705014">So even in a mail order business, there are benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.176" offset="10717240">Now, it would be insufficient in and off themselves we feel that it is one leg up towards supporting taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.681" offset="10787248">The other thing that we would like to observe is that the society did indeed exploit the California market in substantial manner with their mail-order sales and this is a factor to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.476" offset="10854435">The court in Miller Brothers versus Maryland held that where there is no intentional continuous systematic exploitation of the market of the jurisdiction attempting to impose a tax, there is insufficient nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.521" offset="10934578">However, it is also recognized that where there is exploitation, that is an important factor and we feel that the society, as a matter of stipulation, had $452,470.00 worth of mail-order sales from the period August 1, 1963 to May 6, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.775" offset="11023604">There is pending, as reflected in the pleadings, a determination by the state of California for subsequent periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.109" offset="11060907">It covers a nine-period and a board has been assessed for mail-order sales exceeding $3,000,500,000.00.</text>

            <text syncTime="2923.345" offset="11793903">First of all, as I mentioned, it is stipulated that the society did do business and they should not be heard to benefit because of the fact that they did not register as they should have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.205" offset="11837370">Secondly, as a matter of logic, the benefits accruing to the foreign retailer or the burdens if any imposed on interstate commerce will remain the same, whether or not they went to the formality of registering to do business.</text>

            <text syncTime="2972.494" offset="11990448">I like to make one further comment on that point, and that is as a matter of policy, the 1965 special subcommittee noted that there is a severe compliance problem with foreign retailers not registering to do business in states at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.001" offset="12052515">I think that if this Court were to increase a foreign retailer’s susceptibility to taxation by virtue of the fact that he voluntarily had registered to pay state taxes that would only encourage evasion of the state requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3191.472" offset="12866386">With regard to the question of whether or not the local activity need to be related to the transaction taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.404" offset="12902121">Our position is in essence that a physical presence within the taxing jurisdiction should be enough and we can draw an analogy to the area of in personam jurisdiction over foreign corporations, whether or not they can be subjected to suit and we note that in Perkins versus Bengay Mining Company in 342 US, it was held that a foreign corporation having administrative activities within the taxing jurisdiction, was held subject to suit for a cause of action arising outside the state, which cause of action bore no relationship whatsoever, to the in state activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.256" offset="13085501">Several commentators have recognized the similarity of the due process requirements in the area of taxation on one hand, and the area of in personam jurisdiction on the other hand.</text>

            <text syncTime="3280.883" offset="13224054">I do not know that constitutionally it is required to relate to the transaction, I think if you can show that they are in a state and that they are deriving benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.164" offset="13273165">Well, it is not a matter of taking on a big load as much as it is trying to equalize the position of our local retailers vis-à-vis foreign retailers and the ones that is most affected by this decision are the big ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.358" offset="13353935">When you limit the requirement to just having use tax collection liabilities upon a foreign retailer with a business office in the state, you are looking only at the rather large foreign retailers, who are the biggest competitive threat that the intent of the use tax was to neutralize.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.039" offset="13464694">We wish to argue that the dissociation test which was set forth in American Oil Company versus Neill should not be applied in this case and that involved an excised tax, the incidence of which fell on the foreign retailer, whereas in this case the incidence of the tax is on the local user and the foreign retailer is required to collect the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.481" offset="13594471">Now, this Court has, in several cases recognized this distinction, particularly in McLeod versus Dilworth in the Norton Company Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.455" offset="13646298">It is a logical distinction because in one case, the foreign retailer bears the brunt of the tax and he is neither authorized nor required as a matter of law to pass that burden on to his purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.528" offset="13702618">In the instance of a use tax collection situation, however, the foreign retailer is but a conduit and he is to pass the tax on to the local user.</text>

            <text syncTime="3415.688" offset="13763222">If he defaults in his performance as such he is ultimately liable, that is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.584" offset="13790807">I had only two matters to touch upon before closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.066" offset="13828737">Comments were made regarding the periodical exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.948" offset="13844306">The periodical exemption is set forth at page 3 of the appendix 2, the brief of appellee and it merely provides that the magazines or all the materials that go into make up the magazines as a periodical are exempt from sales and use tax and it has always been our consistent position that whereby state legislative grace, we exempt the particular activity from sales and use tax, does not mean that we blindfold ourselves to consider that as a factor in supporting the use tax collection liability that is appropriate on the mail order sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.851" offset="13991950">We noted that the society conceded that if the magazine was sold from its own newsstands in California, that the disputed tax on the mail order sales would be proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.927" offset="14064257">We say then to why not extend it to this situation where there are advertising soliciting offices, both activities would equally draw up on the benefits conferred by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.840" offset="14119845">There would an, either, event be no greater burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.708" offset="14143356">It would then seem that the character of the local contact, if it need not be related to the transaction taxed is fairly irrelevant so long as it is substantially draws up on the benefits that this state has conferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.210" offset="14225380">In summary, we feel that the requirement of a use tax collection liability on foreign retailers maintaining a place of business within the taxing jurisdiction meets the requirements of the due process and Commerce Clause test.</text>
