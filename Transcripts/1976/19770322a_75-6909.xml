            <label>Mr. Bennett H. Brummer</label>
            <text syncTime="49.297" offset="297734">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, I would like to take this opportunity to introduce Albert G. Caruana, Esquire, co-counsel for Petitioner and a member of the Bar of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.370" offset="353950">We are before the Court this afternoon on certiorari to review the first decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to interpret and apply this Court’s decision in Chambers v. Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.549" offset="406717">We urge this Court to reverse the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.192" offset="421241">In this case, the repeated application of Florida’s Voucher Rule devastated the Petitioner’s ability to demonstrate his innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.795" offset="455723">The Voucher Rule clearly serves no legitimate State interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.797" offset="471710">Thus, the Voucher Rule’s impact on the Petitioner’s rights to fair trial, confrontation and compulsory process deprive the Petitioner of due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.069" offset="516745">This case arose out of the death of the Petitioner’s daughter as a result of the battered child syndrome.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.461" offset="546315">The issue was, who was responsible?</text>
            <text syncTime="115.608" offset="562929">The State charged the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.950" offset="576304">At trial, the defense attempted to prove, one, that the Petitioner was innocent; and, two, that the Petitioner’s wife, Linda, was probably responsible for the child’s death  -- Linda, who had been the only other suspect.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="137.154" offset="649133">Mr. Brummer, at trial did you ever really take that position, that the mother was guilty of the battery?</text>
            <text syncTime="145.254" offset="681525">That’s one of the arguments your opponent makes, and I didn’t find you really squarely raise that in the trial.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bennett H. Brummer</label>
            <text syncTime="150.533" offset="702632">Your Honor, we were not counsel for the Petitioner at the trial; but I think that it was clear on the record of this case that Linda was adverse to this Petitioner at the time she was called to the stand by the defense, if that’s the direction of Your Honor’s question.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="166.187" offset="765222">Well, I suppose the question is, did the defendant or his counsel ever specifically advise the trial judge that it was his theory that the wife was guilty of killing the child?</text>

            <text syncTime="177.095" offset="808898">Absolutely, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.251" offset="813496">I believe the record is very clear in this regard, and there are a number of places in the record where this is so.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.643" offset="835125">First of all, it’s clear on the record that Linda had been the only other suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.550" offset="850694">She had given a statement to the police, which tended to incriminate the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.817" offset="867726">She was listed as a State’s witness on the State’s witness list.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.375" offset="882041">She had been subpoenaed to the trial by the State and brought to the trial by the State from Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.976" offset="908373">In his Motion to Suppress, the Petitioner said that he had confessed in order to protect his wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.594" offset="930838">In opening statement, the defense said it would show who probably killed the child, and it was not the Petitioner, and that Linda Maness would be the defense’s chief witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.994" offset="980471">Of course, after Linda took the stand and she testified consistently with the State’s theory of the case, any question as to her adversity clearly was cleared up.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.154" offset="1041075">There is an immediate denial by Linda that she was guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.238" offset="1069496">In that there were only two suspects here, if she is not guilty, the Petitioner is.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="247.747" offset="1091543">You didn’t expect her to say, yes, she was guilty, did you?</text>

          <turn speaker="bennett_h_brummer" startTime="253.496" stopTime="292.545">
            <label>Mr. Bennett H. Brummer</label>
            <text syncTime="253.496" offset="1114531">We did not expect her to say that she was guilty, but we felt that we were entitled to a fair opportunity to present our defense for consideration of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.278" offset="1161656">The testimony that she came out with -- that she had been out of the house at the time that the baby was injured, and the baby had been alone with the Petitioner at that time -- was refuted by her letters, by her statements to various witnesses who were present to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.120" offset="1228947">We wanted from her own mouth to explain before the jury how she made these statements, so the jury could weigh her credibility when she testified that she was not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.855" offset="1267922">We also sought --</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="292.545" offset="1270639">But did you make an effort, in sidebar conference or whatever Florida procedure provides in a case like that, to show that regardless of the general rule that the trial judge in this case, after what you had shown, should make an exception to the Voucher Rule?</text>

            <label>Mr. Bennett H. Brummer</label>
            <text syncTime="309.035" offset="1336676">Your Honor, the Voucher Rule was applied to keep out numerous items of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.866" offset="1363948">Each time, the Petitioner vigorously attempted by every means at his disposal to get this evidence admitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.491" offset="1402505">With regard to the letters, in particular, Counsel said, “This is of utmost importance that we get these letters into the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.696" offset="1431344">If I don’t know how to do it, please tell me.”</text>
            <text syncTime="335.088" offset="1440853">The Court would not tell him. He then asked for a recess so that he could research the law in order to find out how to get those letters in.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.578" offset="1466871">But it was clear that no matter how he turned around, the Court had the answer, and the answer was the Voucher Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.883" offset="1492053">That was the only answer that the Court had for the Petitioner’s attempt to present his side of the story.</text>

            <text syncTime="422.892" offset="1792043">But neither the Respondent nor the Court came forward with any request for those letters.</text>

            <text syncTime="619.372" offset="2578015">I believe the record reflects that they were not marked even for identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.750" offset="2607481">The Federal District judge found that we had, in fact, exhausted our State remedies and denied the Petition on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.724" offset="2635380">On appeal, the Fifth Circuit made certain findings of fact and conclusions of law, which we believe to be erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.108" offset="2672892">The first and foremost is that the Petitioner’s trial did not violate the fundamental fairness standard discussed by this Court in Chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.970" offset="2716360">The Court made some contradictory findings, and we believe that they are or should be the focus of this Court’s review of the Fifth Circuit’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.207" offset="2749378">The Fifth Circuit said that the Voucher Rule undoubtedly worked to the Petitioner’s detriment and that some evidence which suggested his innocence had been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.643" offset="2791070">Moreover, the integrity of the fact-finding process had been impaired due to the Petitioner’s inability to cross-examine Linda Maness.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.069" offset="2820745">It should be pointed out that he actually attempted to have Linda Maness admit that she knew that Garry Maness, the Petitioner, did not do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.832" offset="2859824">He was interrupted in mid-question by an objection based on the Voucher Rule, which was sustained by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.087" offset="2884902">We feel that the defendant had that right, and this was a crucial exercise of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.764" offset="2919592">Regardless of the record, and regardless of its own findings, the Fifth Circuit concluded that the extent to which the Voucher Rule interfered with the right to present a defense was not sufficient to constitute a denial of fundamental fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.650" offset="2975076">We believe there are two bases on which this decision is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.083" offset="2996810">First, we believe that the record does reflect a violation of the fundamental fairness guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.117" offset="3016977">Second, we believe that the record reflects a violation of the Sixth Amendment guarantees incorporated in the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.996" offset="3044458">This lower threshold standard, which the Fifth Circuit said did not form a part of this Court’s decision in Chambers, was completely ignored by the Fifth Circuit otherwise in its disposition of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.780" offset="3111644">We submit that the damage done to the Petitioner’s case in this case was a greater depravation than that reflected in Chambers v. Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.338" offset="3153858">More evidence favorable to the Petitioner was excluded in Maness than in Chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.504" offset="3174547">In Chambers, the third party’s confession was admitted into evidence and was before the jury for the jury’s consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.735" offset="3203491">Chambers was restricted only in his ability to cross-examine the third- party confessor as to his repudiation of that confession.</text>
