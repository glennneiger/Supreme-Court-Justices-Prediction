            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We will hear arguments in Number, 1775, Massachusetts against Westcott.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.192" offset="308120">Mr. Whitehead you may precede when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Whitehead</label>
            <text syncTime="54.487" offset="321285">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.453" offset="333197">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.297" offset="356603">It involves the criminal action brought by Massachusetts against Jack B. Westcott for violation of Chapter 35 of the Acts and Resolves of the General Court of Massachusetts for the year 1923.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.001" offset="407385">Chapter 35 makes it unlawful during the months of July, August and September.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.822" offset="430686">For any person who has not been a legal resident of Massachusetts during the preceding year to use beam or otter trawls to direct a fish and certain of the waters of Vineyard Sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.914" offset="471019">Vineyard Sound is a body of water lying between the Island of Martha’s Vineyard and the Elizabeth Islands, off the coast of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.445" offset="505187">The sole issue before the court today is where the Chapter 35, and so far as it differentiates between residents and non-residents of Massachusetts, violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause contained in Article 4 Section 2 of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.682" offset="570075">The facts maybe briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.301" offset="580524">Mr. Westcott is a resident of Rhode Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.308" offset="592645">On September 5th, 1973, he undertook to drag by means of an otter trawl for scup and fluke, which are migratory fish in the waters described by Chapter 35.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.759" offset="642382">He was thereupon arrested by an officer of the Massachusetts Department of Natural Resources and charged with violating statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.727" offset="674252">On April 24th, 1974, he was tried and found guilty of this violation by the District Court of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.134" offset="707897">Upon his conviction in the District Court, he pursued his rights under Massachusetts’s law, to do an over-review in the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.486" offset="737364">However, in lieu of the trial in the Superior Court, the parties filed an agreed statement of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.470" offset="761292">Westcott then presented a motion to dismiss the action based upon two grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.511" offset="781458">First, the Chapter 35 violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause contained in Article 4 Section 2 and Second, that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.231" offset="824299">The Superior Court reserved decision on the motion to dismiss and reported the constitutional questions to the Appeals Court of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.472" offset="857213">Shortly thereafter, the Supreme Judicial Court granted direct appellant review.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.204" offset="876231">On March 12, 1976, without ruling on equal protection claim, the Supreme Judicial Court declared that Chapter 35 does violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause in order that the motion to dismiss be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.947" offset="931192">It is our position that the Supreme Judicial Court erred in finding Chapter 35 unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.888" offset="958882">I would like to begin my argument by discussing the relationship between the fisheries of Massachusetts and the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.746" offset="986363">I will then proceed to the constitutional doctrine by which we believe this court has given recognition to that kind of interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.231" offset="1020322">The fisheries of Massachusetts are one of the most important natural resources of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.358" offset="1040802">In economic terms they provide the basis for one of the states most significant industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.563" offset="1065671">Equally as important as economics though, they furnished the basis for a unique way of life for many of the states citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.925" offset="1099107">That way of life is exemplified in such well known seaports as Nantucket and New Bedford and gives the state a quality distinct from that, which other states have.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="266.086" offset="1167757">Well, that fishery is a unique and important aspect of the economic life of the common wealth of the state, etcetera, etcetera, etcetera.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="whitehead" startTime="277.875" stopTime="572.082">
            <label>Mr. Whitehead</label>
            <text syncTime="277.875" offset="1214882">I think it is more likely that the fisheries of Rhode Island would be greater interest to a Rhode Island resident than would be in the fisheries of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.103" offset="1251767">Although, of course, Mr. Westcott contends that he is also interested in the fisheries of Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.454" offset="1273187">However, the fisheries of Massachusetts, I think, account for a way of life in Massachusetts, which is somewhat unique from that, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, or any of the other coastal states.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.324" offset="1332642">They serve as a major reason why many people come to live within Massachusetts and why many others who were born there remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.813" offset="1362631">In short, they constitute a primary factor underlying the state’s continuing vitality.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.624" offset="1389902">However, just as they are an important resource, the fisheries of Massachusetts are a fragile one.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.718" offset="1414248">They are therefore worthy of special protection by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.198" offset="1436191">It is our position that this court has set forth a framework, which gives recognition to the unique interest, which the state possesses in its natural resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.193" offset="1476106">In the past it has used that framework to answer challenges brought under the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.300" offset="1500557">Specifically, in cases such as McCready v. Virginia, Geer v. Connecticut, and Patsone v. Pennsylvania, the court has ruled that the citizens of a state possess in a collective capacity a property interest in the state’s resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.923" offset="1571088">The court has further ruled that accordingly, the right of those citizens to use the state’s resources is not a right derived from the citizenship per se but rather a right derived from their citizenship and their property combined.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.323" offset="1628662">It is therefore not a privilege or immunity of citizenship guaranteed to the citizens of other states under the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.286" offset="1664502">On only one occasion has the court departed from this analysis, that was in Toomer v. Whitsel decided in 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.511" offset="1701386">In Toomer, the court held that the right of the citizens of South Carolina to take migratory shrimp from the three-mile marginal belt located off of that state’s coastline was not a property right but rather was a privilege or immunity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.857" offset="1762826">As such it was not a right which could be denied to the citizens of other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.521" offset="1781426">Massachusetts concedes that if Toomer controls here, Chapter 35 must be held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.041" offset="1807548">However, we contend that Toomer, no longer serves as valid precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.882" offset="1830849">The court in Toomer declared that South Carolina did not posses an ownership interest in the shrimp for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.155" offset="1860002">First, it was the court’s view that migratory animals are by their nature inherently incapable of being owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.184" offset="1892080">Second, a prior decision of the court had held that that Federal Government possesses paramount control of the resources of the marginal sea such that none of those resources is susceptible to state ownership.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.828" offset="1954670">The second basis of the court’s decision in Toomer , namely that the resources of the three-mile belt and one of the paramount control of the federal government has been completely undermined by the passage of this Submerged Lands Act in 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.580" offset="2013706">By that legislation, Congress expressly conveyed to the states both title two and ownership in all the resources of the marginal sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.877" offset="2050905">Accordingly, the states now possess the same rights of ownership in those resources as this court had held them to possess with respect to human resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.900" offset="2086954">Thus, if Toomer has to control at all in this case, it must be on the first ground articulated by the court, namely that migratory animals are by their nature inherently incapable of being owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.877" offset="2138885">That ground finds no support in prior Supreme Court adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.828" offset="2158634">This court had never before held that a state’s ownership in migratory animals differed from its ownership in stationary animals.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.645" offset="2193951">Even more significantly, the congresses, when it passed the Submerged Lands Act to know such distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.358" offset="2220805">In its conveyance, it conveyed title and ownership to all the resources of the marginal sea, specifically all fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.477" offset="2257272">We submit that the relative mobility of the given species is an illusive concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.426" offset="2285066">That being true, the appropriateness of the distinction based upon that concept is a matter best left to congressional analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.835" offset="2318712">In this instance, Congress has determined that mobility is not the criteria and upon which important right should turn and that being the case, this court should respect this judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.141" offset="2359986">We submit that the court should now find that migratory fish located in the three-mile belt are in fact owned by the respective states.</text>

            <text syncTime="1457.094" offset="5931760">It does not bar it absolutely but when there is a discrimination, this court has said that the aliens or the non-citizens must be the peculiar source of the evil at which the statute is aimed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1579.544" offset="6421504">For example, in July of last year, this court decided Kleppe v. New Mexico, involving the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.250" offset="6504364">The Federal Government agency asked, could they be returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.345" offset="6524740">The State of New Mexico commenced an action in the Federal District Court and that court held on the basis of the McCready case that the federal statute was unconstitutional to special public interest doctrine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1706.995" offset="6931310">Yes sir, I admit that it was dictum but nonetheless it was included within the thinking of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.613" offset="6949804">We submit as an example of the paramount federal power to which the state must exercise its power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.753" offset="7002363">Any event, as we see Massachusetts’s position, they do not point to aliens as a particular source of evil and frankly, as we see it, they do not even try to justify the statute as a conservation statute and as you have heard in their argument that merely says that the statute -- they in effect say that the clause is inapplicable because of the special interest doctrine of McCready v. Virginia as we see the structure of their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.294" offset="7116570">Now, that doctrine as my brother pointed out -- that doctrine states that the citizens own the wild life of the state in common, that the State Government exercises that ownership as sort of a trustee, and that the State Government in the exercise of that ownership can discriminate against non citizens, namely those who do not have that beneficial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.134" offset="7211865">And then it goes on to say that the right to hunt and fish of the state citizen derives from ownership and not citizenship and so, consequently that is not a privilege of citizenship guaranteed to citizens of other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.961" offset="7275186">I believe Justice White, you were getting at a point, which seems germane to me and that is that in the McCready Case, the court points out that the ownership derives really from two sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.343" offset="7320743">It derives from the citizenship of the state as a state citizen and he gets his ownership by virtue of being a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.241" offset="7348328">So consequently, I would be so bold as to say that there maybe a fallacy in the McCready reading because if that is true, obviously then, the Privileges and Immunities Clause would apply even in the McCready situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.192" offset="7416142">The problem of course, with relying on the McCready Case is that Toomer v. Whitsel stands in the way like a huge roadblock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.425" offset="7449057">Now, I think it is important to know the factual situation which confronted the court when that case was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.805" offset="7478627">The shrimp fishery, which was off to Southern Coast was not a shrimp fishery that was restricted within the territorial waters of any state, it was a giant fish shrimpery and the shrimp would migrate South and the commercial shrimp fishermen would start up the Northern part of their Shrimp fishery and follow them right down to Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.019" offset="7559398">South Carolina passed a statute which restricted fishing to residents of South Carolina within the territorial seas of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.475" offset="7597223">The consequence was, that you had the shrimp fishery partitioned along these state lines and what in effect you had as I described in our brief is a feudal situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.129" offset="7643930">So, that was the situation that the court faced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.893" offset="7662947">The court was well aware of the McCready case of course, because South Carolina relied upon it exclusively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.579" offset="7693667">And the court characterized the McCready case as the sole case using the special public interest doctrine to justify discrimination against commercial hunting and fishing by non citizens, absent persuasive independent reasons to support that discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.786" offset="7774542">It then distinguished McCready on the two grounds already mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.125" offset="7787917">McCready dealt with stationary fish in tidal waters and Toomer dealt with migratory fish in the marginal sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.724" offset="7822294">It characterized McCready as the sole exception to the general rule and Toomer is a case that on its facts did not fall within that exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.705" offset="7862209">And then it said that the very facts distinguishing Toomer made the McCready case a very weak prop for South Carolina to rely upon because -- and then it gets to the crucial point that is very doubtful whether migratory fish can be owned citing the illustrious case of Missouri v. Holland where the court said that was the treaty case involving the migratory birds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.361" offset="7976835">“To put the claim of the state upon title is to lean upon a slender reed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.079" offset="7995643">Wild birds are not on the possession of anyone and possession is the beginning of ownership” and so consequently, on that basis and also on the basis that the state did not own the three-mile belt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.647" offset="8046007">Although the court recognized that it could regulate within the three-mile belt, the court said that the McCready Case did not apply and then it came to some other very seminal language, which I should like to quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.909" offset="8098983">The court said “The whole ownership theory in fact is now generally regarded as what a fiction expressive in legal shorthand of the importance to its people but the state have power to preserve and regulate the exploitation of an important resource and there is no necessary conflict between that vital policy consideration and the constitutional command that the state exercise that power, like its other powers, so as not to discriminate without reason against citizens of other states.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2949.558" offset="11901576">States with small boundaries like New Hampshire, for example, up where I live would have a very limited area in which to fish, because they just obviously would not own as much of the marginal sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.447" offset="11945148">The special public interest doctrine would also be a step backwards because it would lead to such situations as we had in the Kleppe Case, which I talked about earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.583" offset="11985690">And quite frankly, it seems to me that this doctrine that Massachusetts would argue for could really lead to the depletion of natural resources because what is really to say that a state is necessarily going to conserve its resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.409" offset="12036995">And certainly as we see a lot of our problems in the marginal sea and out of the 200 mile limit right now, we are beginning to realize that there has to be a broader control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.136" offset="12075865">If within the three mile limit the states had this exclusive powers, we really cannot say what might happen and so, in conclusion we submit that the court should affirm the decision of the Supreme Judicial Court.</text>
