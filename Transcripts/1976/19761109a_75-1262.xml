            <text syncTime="9.463" offset="138400">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.807" offset="155746">I wish to deal, this morning, with Title XVI of the United States Code Section 480, in which congress did express its intention that there should be a dual jurisdiction in the National Forest between the Federal Government and so far as the crimes against the United States are concerned, which were left to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.880" offset="252085">And reserving to the State wherein the National Forest is located its jurisdiction and it did not deprive the inhabitants thereof of their rights and privileges as citizens, or be absolved from their duties as citizens of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.212" offset="317391">Now our contention is that one of those duties is the payment of the local ad valorem real property tax, and as has been expressed, since we are talking about property that is in the public domain and tax exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.100" offset="372875">The only means by which such a tax can be paid is to through the possessory interest tax, in other words, the tax on the beneficial use and occupation of tax-exempt property.</text>

            <text syncTime="90.199" offset="461274">I believe, I think it is Johnson v. Yosemite were that specifically was excluded, you are correct Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.796" offset="491680">However, the State of California does levy a sales-tax on retail sales in the National Forest areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.862" offset="527938">So, that has not been precluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.238" offset="541522">However, we are mainly talking about an increment of local property tax which benefits those inhabitants and I am speaking specifically now to the increment that goes to the local school district tax; that is based in California primarily on the local real property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.817" offset="615814">Now, there was some testimony or a statement yesterday that some of these people have resided in these government homes in the National Forest for two or three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.438" offset="650296">There is evidence in this record, that in one case, an employee had been on the same single-family residence for fifteen years.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.872" offset="688017">Now during that period and of course this would be prior to 1968 when we started imposing this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.312" offset="717796">In effect, he would have paid no increment, whatsoever, to the local school tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.857" offset="743919">If he had a six-year-old child when he moved into that home, that child would have gone through the local school district to the elementary schools, the high school, and two years of the community college if that were the case, being a hypothetical situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="820.102" offset="3380928">I think that what the United States is fighting here is a different case and we do not have those facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="844.410" offset="3478208">If the case would never arise in the County of Tuolomy, that is you could never get those facts before this court since we have absolutely no federal installations in the County of Tuolomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.629" offset="3531079">The United States in its brief, talks about the twelve Forest Service Personnel and their families.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.371" offset="3558038">In the county that they are residing, in the twelve residences in the County of Tuolomy, almost as if they were chattels.</text>

            <text syncTime="875.866" offset="3604013">They are living in these homes with their families, sending their children to our schools and albeit they may be on-call twenty-four hours a day, they have not sold their souls, as it were, to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.270" offset="3661587">I cannot make a distinction between the twelve Forest Service Personnel we have here, and the many, many more Forest Service Personnel who work in the Stanislaus National Forest in our county, who reside off federal premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.339" offset="3729924">They either purchase homes, and many do, or they rent property.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.324" offset="3745806">When they purchase their home, they must pay a property tax as a homeowner, when they rent they are indirectly paying property tax unless they have a landlord who does not want to recoup his payment of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.059" offset="3800768">And if this particular individuals living in a forest service housing are allowed not to pay a tax or a rule the tax is unconstitutional, they are really getting a better deal than their counterparts living out on the economy as it were.</text>

            <text syncTime="1275.077" offset="5200826">We are informed by the Department of the Navy that Humboldt County in California is attempting to tax Navy housing, so that the potential for the imposition of this tax on the military exists now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.096" offset="5252862">With respect to this specific case, I should point out that 16 U. S. C. 480 provides that state civil and criminal jurisdiction continued to apply in National Forest areas, so that we are not dealing with an exclusive federal enclave when we talk about National Forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.163" offset="5329140">However, 16 U. S. C. 480 is not a waiver of this immunity of the United States, its instrumentalities, or its officers in connection with their duties from the imposition of state taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.109" offset="5376996">Now there is second major point I would like to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.620" offset="5387027">The counties claim they are simply seeking to make up revenues lost, because National Forests are not taxable since it is United States property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.956" offset="5428301">16 U.S. Code Section 500 provides that the counties shall receive 25% of the receipts from the National Forests located in their jurisdiction to be applied for roads and schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.051" offset="5484725">So Congress has enacted a kind of in lieu tax, because the National Forests are not themselves directly taxable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.801" offset="5519729">Now there is one other point, because the tax is on a federal function in our view, there is no requirement that a burden or interference of any other kind be shown and that the tax has been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.707" offset="5579393">This court has held that National Banks are not taxable by States except to the extent there has been a waiver, even though there is no burden on the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="1389.040" offset="5656715">That would be our contention on any exclusive military enclave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.923" offset="5672180">Now there are military bases which are like National Forests in the sense that the federal government hasn’t seeded all civil and military dues -- or has not taken back all civil and military jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.082" offset="5720872">In those again, we would argue that the tax is like a tax on the Post Exchange or military officer’s club involved in the Mississippi liquor case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.382" offset="5754100">We would say it is still falling on a federal instrumentality or a federal function and once we established that then that is the end of any demonstration, any need to demonstrate burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.422" offset="5794224">There is no great burden on the United States if military personnel pay a tax on their liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.937" offset="5812301">But the court has held that that is nonetheless unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.316" offset="5825780">The same is true for National Banks or the Red Cross for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.350">Thank you your Honors.</text>
