            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="42.693" offset="271282">Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.224" offset="285388">The question presented by this case is whether the double jeopardy clause precludes the government from appealing an order terminating the prosecution, but entered after a mistrial had been declared because the jury was unable to agree upon a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.586" offset="346828">This case began when the United States filed a civil antitrust complaint against respondents, their president and a Third Linen Supply Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.520" offset="386535">The parties soon agreed upon a consent decree and the consent decree was entered in the summer of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.222" offset="417359">In 1971, the United States filed petitions charging respondents and their president with civil and criminal contempt with that consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.800" offset="459677">The petitions alleged that respondents threatened other linen supply firms with retaliation if they engaged in competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.468" offset="490397">Petitions also alleged that respondents made good their threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.989" offset="508474">The District Court entered an order, holding that the allegations did not sufficiently charge of violation of the consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.958" offset="540344">The United States appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.884" offset="556017">It held that although respondents are entitled to engage in vigorous competition, they are not entitled to do so on a selective or retaliatory basis or to make threats to competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.413" offset="602097">In other words, the Court of Appeals held, the competition must be directed to consumers and the threats of reprisals directed to competitors were inconsistent with the consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.891" offset="652043">On remand in a District Court, a jury trial was held on the criminal contempt charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.365" offset="677957">The government introduced testimony from a former employee of respondents and from respondents’ competitors demonstrating that respondents threaten the officers of competitors with retaliation if they persisted in competing.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.286" offset="733650">If a competitor did not desist, respondents’ mounted a competitor specific sales campaign that is instead of soliciting all potential users of linen supply services.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.258" offset="781506">They directed their sales efforts toward making low price offers to the customers of the particular offending competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.890" offset="812017">They also made threats to competitors in the hope that these threats and the retaliatory sales campaigns taken together would stave off competition by making it more costly.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.741" offset="859455">At the end of trial, the jury returned the verdict of not guilty with respect to respondent’s president Mr. Troy who had not been linked personally with any of the threats.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.163" offset="901147">The jury announced that it was hopelessly deadlocked with respect to respondents, although, it stood 11 to 1 in favor of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.962" offset="936360">The judge declared a mistrial without objection and he dismissed the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.903" offset="960079">The judge then invited motions for judgments of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.781" offset="975648">He expressed dissatisfaction with the consent decree stating that respondents had been improvident in accepting its strictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.934" offset="1008249">He also stated that he believed the evidence introduced by the government was inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.841" offset="1031864">Respondents accepted the invitation and six days later, they filed motions for judgments of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.022" offset="1060598">Approximately two months later, the judge granted both of those motions without writing an opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.582" offset="1090796">The United States appealed for a second time.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.655" offset="1103126">It argued in essence that the testimony at trial established the allegations of the contempt petitions because the Court of Appeals had held on the first appeal that proof of threats and retaliatory sales campaigns would demonstrate a violation of the consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.118" offset="1172925">We argued that the District Court’s grant of the judgment of acquittal not withstanding, at least prima facie proof of threats and retaliatory sales campaigns.</text>

            <text syncTime="276.346" offset="1205839">In your view Mr. Easterbrook, I assume at the stage of trial that the jury announced it was deadlocked, was there an authority in the judge to at that point direct a verdict of acquittal?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_h_easterbrook" startTime="296.647" stopTime="304.502">
            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="296.647" offset="1287132">Your Honor, directed verdicts of acquittal by the jury were abolished by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29 (A) and therefore in our view, he did not have such authority.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="304.502" offset="1318479">Well, he had no authority at that stage to terminate the proceedings by an acquittal?</text>

            <text syncTime="312.895" offset="1352125">He did have the authority at that stage to terminate the proceedings by entering a judgment of acquittal on his own which would represent his view that the evidence taken in the light most favorable to the government together with all of his legitimate inferences was insufficient to make out a case for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.654" offset="1415132">Although in this case he did not do that, and instead he allowed the jury to continue its deliberations and eventually discharged them, and he did not declare he did not have a judgments of acquittal until two months and five days later.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="frank_h_easterbrook" startTime="358.269" stopTime="452.039">
            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="358.269" offset="1533519">But before I come to that I would like to discuss two issues that are lurking in the background of this case but that we think the court need not to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.941" offset="1572285">The first of these issues is whether the double jeopardy clause applies to corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.256" offset="1589526">Both respondents are corporations and unless the Double Jeopardy Clause applies to them in a way that creates principles of finality more stringent than those that Res Judicata there could be no barred with second trial here.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.493" offset="1646473">I will not discuss that issue here however, because it was not raised by the parties in the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals did not discuss it.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.470" offset="1674371">The issue is squarely presented, however, in United States against Security National Bank in which a petition for a writ of certiorari is pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.300" offset="1705718">The United States believes that the court should address that issue in Security Bank, but that it is not necessary to do so in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.354" offset="1733930">Second issue I will not discuss at length is the effect of mid-trial terminations whether they are called judgments of acquittal or orders dismissing the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.328" offset="1773846">We have discussed that problem at pages 12 to 19 of our brief and we have shown that there is no absolute bar to a re-prosecution unless the jury returns a verdict of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.597" offset="1822851">When a defendant requests a mid-trial termination, he has exercised his right to control the conduct of the proceedings and has voluntarily surrendered his right to receive the verdict of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.530" offset="1866633">In such cases, no less than in cases in which the mid-trial termination is called a mistrial like United States against Dennis, the double jeopardy clause does not bar a second trial.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="452.039" stopTime="458.526">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="452.039" offset="1908637">Well, the argument in your brief under A would cover a mid-trial termination?</text>

            <text syncTime="470.678" offset="1983243">Our argument is in the last analysis that only a verdict of acquittal by the jury is an absolute bar to retrial.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.014" offset="2036533">That is correct, but I think it is more appropriate for me to make here at a greater length the narrower arguments that would avoid the necessity to reach that particular one.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.003" offset="2076553">Although I will say that the mid-trial termination problem has recently received a thoughtful and very thorough analysis in a case called United States against Sanabria decided by the First Circuit on December 29.</text>

            <text syncTime="514.001" offset="2156487">This case however simply does not involve the mid-trial termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.688" offset="2171220">The case went to completion and ended in a mistrial when the jury was unable to reach a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.750" offset="2191491">The difficult questions presented by mid-trial terminations, therefore, need to be resolved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.506" offset="2214479">In our view, a single, simple principle controls this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.250" offset="2233496">It is a principle That is been accepted since Mr. Justice Story’s opinion for the Court in 1824 United States against Perez.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.175" offset="2269232">The principle is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.464" offset="2278322">The declaration of a mistrial because the jury is unable to agree upon a verdict removes any double jeopardy objection to a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.817" offset="2315730">Once the jury has reached an impasse, the judge is entitled to set the case for a second trial because of manifest necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.871" offset="2351988">We do not understand respondents to quarrel with this and if the District Court may set the case for a second trail without offending the double jeopardy clause, then the Court of Appeals may direct the District Court to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.399" offset="2402038">This follows we believes from United States against Sanford decided by this Court on October 12th of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.857" offset="2427952">In that case, the court held that the double jeopardy clause does not bar review of orders entered after a mistrial has been declared terminating the prosecution, even though in Sanford, the order was based in substantial part on evidence that was heard at trial and even though in Sanford, the District Court concluded that the evidence of trial showed that respondents had a complete defense to the charges against them.</text>

            <text syncTime="603.344" offset="2513842">Mr. Easterbrook before you get too deeply into the double jeopardy argument, do not you have a statutory problem?</text>

            <text syncTime="1863.022" offset="7552549">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.480" offset="7570417">There is a narrow and a limited constitutional question involved here and I confess to the court that much has been written about the problem of Double Jeopardy both before and after the 1970 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.050" offset="7628722">I will not suggest to the Court that everything has been written and the area is consistent, nor will I suggest to the Court that there is a single case handled by this Court in which there has been a dispositive ruling, a ruling on facts on all squares with ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.700" offset="7695282">I do suggest, however, that the precedent and the policy of the administration of criminal justice both support the affirmance of the judgments below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.168" offset="7741153">Turning first to the question, then of course the fountainhead of all decisions and all considerations in a case like this is Mr. Justice Story’s opinion in the Perez case in 1824.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.398" offset="7790055">That case ordinarily is cited for his words about the prisoner has been neither convicted nor acquitted then therefore maybe put to his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.090" offset="7832895">Similarly the words manifest necessity, the words of ends of public Justice, but I come after those words to the words that I think are really, now this is back in 1824 are really those that are applicable here after talking about the discretion to be exercised by the trial judge and you remember that Perez was a hung jury case and the question was it capital case and the question was what was the trial judge’s power at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.782" offset="7963612">Mr. Justice Story said, “But after all they, the judges, have the right to order the discharge and the security which the public have for the faithful, sound and conscious exercise of this discretion rests in this as in other cases upon the responsibility of the judges under their oaths of office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.156" offset="8069147">Now, that it seems to me as what we have today is to determine what the trial judge’s function is in a case and how he exercised that function in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.134" offset="8109062">The Perez case of course has been cited down through 1976 by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.003" offset="8136543">Perhaps one of the most pertinent observations about it was in this Court in Wade v. Turner where it was pointed out that the value of the Perez principles thus lies in the capacity for informed application under widely different circumstances without injury to defendant or to the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.407" offset="8214074">That after all is the resolution at least remains in this or in any other case involving the administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.633" offset="8246988">The resolution of the problems, the public interest on the one hand, the private interest of the individual on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.084" offset="8276873">But counsel for the government says that only the jury can determine facts, That is thought were Mr. Hayrlin said for this court in Sisson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.712" offset="8319295">That court in Sisson case for its decision on appealability as you know much has written about that by Mr. Hayrlin, but this court said then in Sisson case that judges like juries can acquit defendants and cited specifically Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of the Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.904" offset="8400066">Then in Illinois against Somerville, this court recently speaking through Mr. Justice Rehnquist for the majority, Mr. Justice White for dissent, both acknowledge the applicability of the Perez Rule, both acknowledge the flexibility of the rule of Perez that there is no fixed mechanical formula, but rather that broad discretion is reserved to the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.886" offset="8504033">Now That is what Rule 29 (c) actually does.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.793" offset="8515632">It gives broad discretion to the trial judge and the judge here exercised that discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.860" offset="8543948">Similarly in other cases, Rule 29 cases, the trial judge has exercised that discussion similarly, particularly the Suarez case out of the Second Circuit which relied on the Second Circuit’s own opinion in the Jenkins case which was later affirmed by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.565" offset="8630779">Suarez is on all fours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.491" offset="8638407">It is a white horse case in so far as the procedural posture of the case is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.659" offset="8663171">It was a multi count indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.759" offset="8675501">Some of the counts were dismissed by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.548" offset="8686682">It went to the Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.964" offset="8692324">The Jury hung up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.728" offset="8703400">The trial court granted a Rule 29 (c) motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.911" offset="8724089">He entered a judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.864" offset="8731926">The Second Circuit said that the entry of that specifically under Rule 29 (c) barred Appeal by the government, that there had been final determination that is what this Circuit said in this case, that is what this case is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.142" offset="8793052">Then in Robins out of the Sixth Circuit, a Rule 29 (a) case, that had cert denied for this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.065" offset="8836729">The court there as one of the Your Honors suggested granted a motion for acquittal at the end of the government’s case, he took it away from the jury at that juncture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.278" offset="8893571">The Sixth Circuit said that jeopardy had attached and that at appeal by the government was barred by the Constitution (Inaudible)against double jeopardy, and that came to this Court, petition was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.649" offset="8955116">I suggest, if the court please, that there is no difference between a Rule 29 (a) acquittal and Rule 29 (c) acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.447" offset="8986254">So what we have are three circuit courts; the Second, the Fifth and the Sixth who have reached decisions under the rule 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.972" offset="9028363">Now, counsel for the government neither in brief nor in an oral argument has cited a single case from the circuit or any other court on a Rule 29 situation that supports the government’s position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.864" offset="9079981">The government’s position here is also baseless under the decision of this court in full form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.257" offset="9121568">In full form which is then reiterated in recent opinions of this court. You had a trial judge take it away during the course of the trial and enter a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.668" offset="9167126">On the facts as they were deuced and this court held that there was no right of appeal by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.380" offset="9205996">I reiterate that neither in oral argument nor in brief has the government supported a single Rule 29 case in its support, but now you come, you cannot get into the precedent in this matter without getting into famous trilogy of Wilson, Jenkins and Serfass.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.050" offset="9276735">Your Honors of course know much more about those cases than I would presume to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.616" offset="9294917">Wilson was appealable because there was, as the court said, there was a guilty verdict entered by the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2403.837" offset="9715802">And I think that we have taken the position and I think it is perfectly supportable that Jenkins is a controlling case and I particularly direct Your Honor’s attention to Footnote 7 in that case where Mr. Justice Rehnquist, if you will remember had before the dissenting opinion or the dissenting position taken by Judge Lombard out of the second circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2428.176" offset="9813186">Judge Lombard was relying on such cases as Illinois versus Somerville and Mr. Justice Rehnquist said judge Lombard analogized respondent’s case to mistrial cases in which the public interest and fair trial designed to end in judgments must be waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.137" offset="9885075">That if it is, we felt, would not be serve or permitting a clearly guilty defendant to go free because of erroneous interpretation of the controlling law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.699" offset="9923318">Speaking for this Court Mr. Justice Rehnquist said, we disagree with this analysis because we think it is of critical importance whether the proceedings of the Trial Court terminated in a mistrial as they did in the Somerville line of cases or ended in defendant’s favor as they did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.112" offset="9992908">In other words, there was a judgment of acquittal in favor of the defendant and of course That is the same case in which speaking for this court very recently, Mr. Justice Rehnquist also said and this gets to the heart of the double jeopardy question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.678" offset="10067201">Here there was a judgment discharging the defendant although we cannot say with assurance whether it was or was not a resolution of the factual issues against the government, but it is enough for purposes of the double jeopardy clause and therefore for the determination of appealability under 3731, that further proceedings of some sort devoted to the resolution of factual issues going to the elements of the offense charged would have been required upon reversal and remand, and ironic part of this case is that this is a criminal contempt case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.549" offset="10222682">Criminal contempt, any contempt of course is a charge of flaunting or denigrating the power, authority and dignity of a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.791" offset="10267612">Here the court against whom the contempt was supposed to have been directed has failed absolutely and in unequivocal language that the defendants are not guilty, that the government has failed to discharge its burden, the defendants are not guilty, using those words if you please Mr. justice Stewart and that they should for that reason be acquitted and they were acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.962" offset="10396344">Now, Serfass; Serfass is simply a pretrial dismissal and as the Chief Justice suggested that really is a test of this sufficiency of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.736" offset="10443468">So also is Sanford.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.187" offset="10449215">Sanford is clearly just as this court held in December of this last year is simply a pretrial dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.508" offset="10494564">Admittedly, the trial court said that the government has consented, and therefore, whatever the proof was by the government, the defendants should have been discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.406" offset="10542107">That did not come into the trial where that evidence was introduced and produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2615.540" offset="10562691">That trial was long gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2618.463" offset="10574394">No Rule 29 motion appears in the reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.262" offset="10593516">That trial was over, but as an after thought and before the next trial the yet to come trial, the defendant filed a motion for dismissal on the ground That is a government’s evidence and now completed trial constituted a complete bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.103" offset="10680869">This court quite properly held that that was nothing but a pretrial dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.239" offset="10701454">Now, if the court please, the authorities, it seems to me the precedent is clearly in support of the position of the respondents here, the two corporations, but there is a very, very important consideration, a policy consideration if the court please, and that relates to the fair accommodation between the proper administration of criminal justice on the public’s behalf and an individual defendant’s right to finality of judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.002" offset="10864458">I think this is what Mr. Justice Black was talking about in Green v. United States speaking for this Court of course, and the underlying argument, one that is deeply ingrained at least in the Anglo sect in the system of jurisprudence is that the state with all it is resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense, an ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent, he may be found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.586" offset="11022864">In other words, when he is acquitted he is acquitted and his trial is over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.131" offset="11048987">The government counsel has said frankly that the question of whether not corporations and the only parties before this court are corporations, are entitled to protection of double jeopardy cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.384" offset="11097993">There is a question yet to be determined by this court and it will be determined on appeal if the court takes it from the Security National Bank case out of the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.532" offset="11142610">He frankly said that this is a determination that need not be made by this Court in this case, but -- and that is a position in all candor that the government takes both in it is brief or petition to cert and also in its main brief in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.959" offset="11204363">On the other hand, I cite that case and the Second Circuit is opinion in that case to show that what Mr. justice Black said about the rights and public policy as to individuals applies as well as to corporations and in this opinion, in December 1976, the Second Circuit in unanimous opinion says no corporation, large or small can escape the incalculable effect which a conviction may have on the public attitude towards the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.768" offset="11335602">Like an individual it must answer to the verdict of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.149" offset="11365068">No corporations, no matter how large can pit its resources against the overwhelming might of the state so as to avoid the harassment and the increasing probability of conviction resulting from re-prosecutions and this unequal contest “fundamental fairness” requires that the government having had a full try at establishing criminal wrongdoing shall not have another, the appeal is dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.505" offset="11502473">Now let us turn those considerations to what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.688" offset="11515220">Let us look at the facts of our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.392" offset="11526087">First of all counsel did not mentioned that the 1969 consent decree was entered into and negotiated after extended grand jury proceedings, considerable time, expense, effort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.660" offset="11587109">The decree was entered in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.758" offset="11603514">Less than two years later, we were faced with Ex parte show cause orders for both criminal and civil contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.415" offset="11642175">We had been negotiating when we had been with them for at least three years, but these were entered Ex parte by the government at the government’s motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.588" offset="11682822">Then we were faced with a prior appeal on the motion to construe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.242" offset="11705496">We lost that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.461" offset="11710303">This Court refused the cert and after that we had extensive discovery on both the criminal and the civil contempt, discovery running in tandem, in addition to discovery under the ominous procedure which prevails in our district and then in 1975, we got to the trial of this case and I think it is very important for this court to know the comments of the trial judge and these are all in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.842" offset="11851886">First of all the government’s position in the trial as shown on page 31 and 32 clearly shows that what it is trying to do is prosecuting industry and we just happen to be the lucky target for the disruptive practices that the government talks about in the industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.353" offset="11925865">We are the only ones as the record shows against which any charges like this have been made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2998.030" offset="12092631">I think the whole court thought, they probably thought the trial judge in Fong Foo had done something improvidently in dismissing or bringing to an end that particular litigation, but the fact is that the court -- there was an acquittal and that no appeal should allow.</text>

            <text syncTime="3042.112" offset="12268905">And that of course is one factor that shows the comprehensive effect of the Court’s ruling in this case is because there is no real reason that it should not apply to other cases except for the fact that you have the judge finding -- he is the one against whom the contempt is posed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3072.063" offset="12388755">Then the trial court says and this indicates that when he dismissed the jury, he did not intend to terminate this trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.358" offset="12425953">He made some remarks from the bench and he said I am open to any motions that either side would like to file; that is at page 33 of the appendix, then on that same page, he told the government, I think you have had your day in court on the criminal contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.017" offset="12504530">I gave you every opportunity to convict these defendants and you came very close on the corporate defendants, but you did not come close on the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.312" offset="12545699">I would be inclined to bring this thing to an end at this time saying in to the government, you shot your best shot and you did not kill anybody, you did not sustain your burden, I find the defendant’s not guilty and I acquit them, this is getting over until the time when he had his order.</text>

            <text syncTime="3184.543" offset="12838688">It is still pending and there is nothing that the government could get in this criminal contempt, by way of penalty that it can also get in the civil contempt which is presently pending in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.685" offset="12883201">Now, what did the trial court say when he entered his judgment of acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.350" offset="12909846">Now each of this is dated April 22, 1975, there is a separate judgment of acquittal as to each corporate defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.017" offset="12948611">The court finds that the ground set forth in that motion are good and valid and that the government has failed to prove the material allegations beyond a reasonable doubt, that further this defendant should be found not guilty, is accordingly a judge that respondent Martin Linen Supply Co is not guilty of the charges against it and is hereby acquitted and discharged as to all charges herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.603" offset="13050907">That is the judge’s order and his opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.426" offset="13074208">The Fifth Circuit of court held that there was no appealability and no appeal available to the government and it is our position of course that each of those judgments are the judgments of both courts below should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.216" offset="13133349">Now, if its not affirmed, if those judgments are not affirmed, how are we going to describe the function of a trial judge in the trial of a criminal case?</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.283" offset="13177653">Judge Simpson on the panel of the Fifth Circuit that heard the argument, an old trial judge, asked the government counsel, he said what difference is there between the acquittal under these circumstances and the acquittal under the circumstances of Robins where the court took it away from the jury at the end of the government’s case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.555" offset="13270753">The government had no satisfactory answer to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.662" offset="13283188">Judge Dyer also an old experienced trial judge, also on the panel said, counsel you would have a good argument if there were not anybody in that courtroom but you and the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.991" offset="13348494">So what are you going to attribute to the trial judge?</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.453" offset="13370332">Now, I suggest if the court please, that unless this trial court’s judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 which had all of the effect of extending this trial in which this judgment of acquittal was entered, in which this evidence was entered and introduced, quite contrary to Sanford, that unless this judgment of acquittal is sustained and affirmed, the trial judge for practical purposes will be sterilized to the position of an impotent umpire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.687" offset="13515259">He will be in the trial court under these circumstances and a position quite like that an umpire at a tennis match.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.488" offset="13566459">If he cannot do something definitive as the presiding officer of that court then he is sitting there doing not much more than calling foot faults, out of bounds and net balls.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.075" offset="13624765">I suggest that the proper function of the trial court is to put him where he is to make decisions and that is what I think Mr. Justice Story was talking back about his early as 1824 and when he enters a judgment of acquittal, its just as effective as if the jury had returned a verdict of guilty.</text>
