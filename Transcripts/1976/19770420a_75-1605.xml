            <text syncTime="13.892" offset="156036">Mr. Miller, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert J. Miller, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="17.721" offset="171396">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.464" offset="190309">This case involves the first time in the 200-year history of our republic that Congress has seen fit to enact legislation seizing the papers, five-and-a-half years of the administration of a former President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.108" offset="288947">The core of this case, if the Court please, involves tapes, some 5,000 hours of tapes, which contain conversations by the former President which deal with a broad spectrum.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.578" offset="366792">They range from political discussions to discussion with his aides as to what steps and decisions should be made by the Presidency.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.822" offset="407752">It also deals with matters highly personal, such as conversations with his wife, conversations with his daughter immediately prior to her marriage and also conversations with his counsel, with his physician and with his clergymen.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.504" offset="490508">One problem with this case in realizing the impact and the effect of the legislation is that involved is 42 million documents as an estimate; but really, the core of this case are the tapes, which were seized by Section 101 of the Act in question, and the balance of the Presidential material.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.189" offset="621225">I would like at the outset to emphasize to the Court that Section 101(a), which seizes the tape recordings, has no qualifying language which indicates that the seizure is directed solely to Presidential material or the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.197" offset="701264">There is a wholesale seizure of those tapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.848" offset="719863">Section 101(b) talks in terms of seizing all of the balance of the Presidential materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.336" offset="761868">These materials which represent the actions, both personal and private, of the former President over a five-and-a-half-year period are currently in the control of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.053" offset="832712">When Mr. Nixon left the White House, he left directions that these materials were to be forwarded to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.898" offset="868134">This direction was countermanded at the request of the Special Prosecutor, and subsequently the legislation in question was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.142" offset="905019">And I emphasize that this legislation, which was enacted and which seized the tapes, which seized all other Presidential materials, was enacted in haste and was enacted without a Congressional hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.621" offset="978998">The impact of this statute on the former President, and indeed on the Presidency itself, is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.628" offset="1019017">First, under Section 102(d) of the Act, access is given to any Agency or Department of the United States to have access to the tape recordings, to have access to any of the Presidential materials of the former President for any lawful Government purpose.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert J. Miller, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="299.905" offset="1300095">I believe that they are in the appendix, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.738" offset="1311484">If not, I can supply the Court with the citation.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.809" offset="1355788">Regulations are Part 105-63 of Title 41, Code of Federal Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.689" offset="1403226">The additional impact of this statue is very clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.778" offset="1419631">First of all, it directs and it has been accomplished a seizure of five-and-one-half years of a man’s entire material, whether they deal with the actions as President, whether they deal with his actions as political leader of his party or whether they deal with actions as a father and as a husband.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.095" offset="1512836">These records have been seized, and they have stayed seized ever since the statute was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.624" offset="1547004">Mr. Nixon has not had access to these records except as he has sent someone 3,000 miles to his home to have access to these particular records.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.297" offset="1597682">The purpose, if the Court please, of Section 104 of the Presidential Materials Act is that these documents or specified portions thereon will be made public.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.586" offset="1654838">That is what Congress enacted, that is what Congress intended, and that is subject only to the adoption of regulations by the Administrator of General Services, which must be approved, or can be disapproved, if I may correct myself, by one House of the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.331" offset="1737803">Those regulations are not in effect, one of the reasons being that they have been proposed, that they have been disapproved, they have been withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.365" offset="1777927">And if the Court please, the status of those regulations is in a very confused state at the moment; but the ultimate purpose, in addition to seizing these records, was that those certain matters in those records would be extracted by the United States and be made public.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.298" offset="1857652">The most intrusive part of the statute in question is that it has authorized the Archivist of the United States, some hundreds is what the plans are, to go through all of these records word by word, all of the tape recordings, whether they involve conversations with his wife, with his daughter, whether they involve conversations dealing with his political decisions, whether they involve decisions dealing with foreign affairs, whether they involve his decisions with respect to domestic matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.538" offset="2018671">It is a wholesale and grand search in any sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.591" offset="2042913">That is the immediate impact of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.212" offset="2069349">The Constitution of the United States vests in a President of the United States the Executive power of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.034" offset="2144686">It is that Executive power which this act impacts directly, because it permits access to, review of and ultimately publication of matters which are totally privileged and presumptively privileged under the decision of this Court in United States versus Nixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.382" offset="2281985">Without the confidentiality that a President of the United States has and expects and has expected for over 200 years until this legislation, this Court has ruled that the President and his aides cannot receive the plain, unvarnished and candid advice that he has the right to expect to receive and must receive for the proper operation of the Presidency of the United States.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="577.149" offset="2409045">Insofar as that is a separation-of-powers argument, Mr. Miller, the act applies only to former President Nixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.392" offset="2446034">There is no reason to think that Congress is going to pass an act that is generally applicable to Presidents in the future, is there?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="herbert_j_miller_jr" startTime="595.446" stopTime="625.752">
            <label>Mr. Herbert J. Miller, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="595.446" offset="2482292">I know of no reason to expect that to happen except that as a second half of the statute in question, a Presidential or a Governmental Materials Commission has been formed and is about to render a report, in which they will make recommendations as to whether Congress should enact legislation which deals with the records and materials of future Presidencies and also with the third branch, the Judiciary.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="625.752" stopTime="632.532">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="625.752" offset="2603501">So there would be time enough, I take it, to confront anything Congress does in response to that report when it does it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="herbert_j_miller_jr" startTime="632.532" stopTime="687.601">
            <label>Mr. Herbert J. Miller, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="632.532" offset="2630668">It would be time enough as to the impact on existing Presidencies; but this act has an impact on the operation of the Presidency already, because people in the White House, whether it be the White House of President Ford or President Carter, recognized that it is possible if this law is sustained on a constitutional basis that the statute will be enacted which will deprive them of their private papers and the papers of their Presidency, because if you can do it in one instance, there is no reason why you cannot do it in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.358" offset="2769953">If the separation-of-powers principle permits Congress to enact legislation seizing every scrap of material for five-and-a half years or six months or three months, as the case is now, of the operations of a President of the United States, I say that that act is totally unconstitutional.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="687.601" stopTime="700.052">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="687.601" offset="2850932">But there is not any impairment of any presently conducted Executive function by the act, where there was in Myers’ or Humphrey’s Executive.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="herbert_j_miller_jr" startTime="700.052" stopTime="734.726">
            <label>Mr. Herbert J. Miller, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="700.052" offset="2900670">I say that there is.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.590" offset="2906834">The act does not apply to any Administrations except that of former President Nixon.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.080" offset="2932852">I say that the principle is a restraining effect on successive Presidencies, because when those Presidents are conferring with their aides, they are doing so with the understanding that possibly all of those deliberations and conversations may be made public by subsequent legislative acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.780" offset="3027625">So I say there is an immediate impact.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="1753.071" offset="7112758">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.154" offset="7129163">I would like in the time available to me to speak to the constitutional standards for evaluating the statute under the three arguments that we presented in our brief, because we think the standards are different and the District Court really applied a balancing test, which is inappropriate to two of the three separate arguments that are made in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.445" offset="7210247">But just momentarily before going to that question, and I think in some way it does relate to the application of a balancing test to the question of separation of powers, I believe Justices White and Rehnquist did raise the question of whether this statute is not in some way constitutionally sufficient, because it either applies only retrospectively to one President or because it might by its application really be read to give President Nixon an opportunity to challenge whenever there is some violation of Presidential confidentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.718" offset="7371370">And we think that that overlooks the basic presumption that underlies our separation-of-powers argument, which is that the notion of separation of powers, as applied to  statements and advice given to a President in confidence, is really a proposition that acts in futuro; in other words, only if a presumption of confidentially exists do existing advisers speak frankly, just as existing law clerks will speak frankly to Justices of this Court, because they know that their advice is given in confidence, in the same way, the near possibility that a statute may be enacted retrospectively to apply to President Ford or Carter or the possibility that a President may be put, with regard to every individual piece of paper or every advice, to the burden of litigating it at some future time and asserting his Presidential privilege is sufficient to impede the free flow of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.131" offset="7613055">And that is precisely why we think this Court adapted the rule of presumption of confidentiality and stated it as strongly as it did in United States versus Nixon.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1887.602" offset="7650880">But the analogy here, Mr. Lewin, is a former Justice of this Court comes in and objects to a law that Congress has passed, and all the present Justices say, "We don't see any problem with it".</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="1899.757" stopTime="2090.092">
            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="1899.757" offset="7699572">Well, I think that the present Justices' law clerks, even if all the present Justices said there was no problem, I think the Justices would agree that the present law clerks and their own relations with their law clerks would be substantially affected by the existence, and indeed by the judicial imprimatur, put upon such as statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.697" offset="7775328">It would mean with regard to your own law clerks that after you left the Court, a similar statute might be enacted; and even though you might think today that it does not concern or does not relate to the way you operate your office, the successor to that seat might differ with that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.540" offset="7838648">And consequently, we have argued in our brief and we believe that no present occupant of a position such as the Presidency or such as an Article III position, on this Court or on any Federal District Court or indeed any Congressman may not permanently waive those elements which are necessarily incident to the proper functioning of that office, even if he agrees with it today, and that, we think, is the basic deficiency in the argument that is made both by the Solicitor General and by the private Appellees when they say that this is not a separation-of-powers case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1967.287" offset="7969679">Indeed it is in every sense, because the issue of confidentiality of Presidential communications, irrespective of what the president incumbent may think of that confidentiality, is a question which is decided in this case for all time and will therefore bind future Presidents, who may disagree with what Mr. Carter believes or what Mr. Ford believes, if indeed Mr. Ford did believe that it made no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.444" offset="8074273">We submit that to the extent that there was really any indication of what Presidential policy was, the agreement, which is in the record, the Nixon-Sampson Depository Agreement, indicates that President Ford believed that for purposes of ongoing Government business, which is really, I think, the principle thing that the Appellees are relying on in this case, which is not so much historical interest, although that is talked about in the legislation; but in the briefs before this Court, heavy emphasis is placed on ongoing Government business, and President Ford was entirely satisfied with an arrangement between himself and his predecessor under which he would be given access.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.300" offset="8229649">And we think that is what 200 years of history have shown, that that is satisfied by arrangements between succeeding Presidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.027" offset="8256608">The Congress had before it no record of extensive disagreement or of extensive situations which presented problems with regard to future Presidents obtaining records that their predecessors may have had, and indeed the Appellees have only plucked out of an entire 200-year history basically, I think, one two or at most three instances where there was a request which was honored, and indeed only one situation where there was a lower-level request which was not honored as between successor Presidents, and that was not by the President in office, but by a very low-ranking individual who would made a call to John Eisenhower and asked him whether he might have a paper and where Mr. Eisenhower said, “We will have that request made by the President himself”, the request was never made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2090.092" offset="8460885">I am a little puzzled by your repeated reference to the judicial area, the communications between law clerks and Justices and judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.900" offset="8500069">What about communications as among the Justices and judges themselves?</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.200" offset="8525251">Would you think they are a lesser or greater privilege?</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="2110.669" offset="8543223">I think the privilege is, in terms of policy reasons, I think it is even greater.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.342" offset="8561822">I have only analogized it in terms of law clerks, because with this Court, and I believe with every individual judge who sits, the analog, I would think, to the President, who is at very top of the Executive structure, who is the Chief Executive, are the subordinates to that President; and consequently, in order to provide the closest analogy, I tried to compare it to those who worked for Justices of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.925" offset="8656176">But certainly to the extent that there are internal Judicial Branch discussions, which by approving this kind of statute this Court would be saying Congress might very well reach those kinds of papers, I think the very same problem exists, and indeed that very report which Mr. Miller was referring to, I think, was suggesting that there would be restraints placed on the ability of Justices to destroy papers, which the leading Justices in the history of this Court down to very modern times have assumed they had certainly the right to do in terms of internal papers.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="2206.087" offset="8924820">Yes, and if I could just in the very few minutes I have, I would like to speak on that bill-of-attainder argument, because I think that here, too, the court below has mistaken the proper constitutional standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.619" offset="8974975">Congress could have enacted a law if it thought on the basis of its various investigations and the discussions of the floor of the Senate that Mr. Nixon was an unreliable custodian of documents, it could have enacted a law that said any unreliable custodian of documents, be it a President, Vice President or any other Federal officer, may have those documents taken away from him if it is shown in a judicial forum that he is an unreliable custodian; and there could be temporary retraining orders, preliminary injunctions, every remedy that this statute provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.598" offset="9094929">What does this statute do more than that statute does?</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.191" offset="9109244">It makes Congress the fact-finder, and that is exactly what this Court has said in a series of cases, culminating with United States versus Brown, that Congress may not be the fact-finder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.886" offset="9152085">And why may Congress not be the fact finder?</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.366" offset="9162012">Because in that case, the party against whom it finds the facts has no judicial trial, no counsel to represent him, no opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses or present witnesses in his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.217" offset="9205375">The entire range of what judicial trial is all about is obviated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.293" offset="9221675">In this case, Congress held not a single hearing on this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.584" offset="9234841">It did hold hearings on a predecessor statute looking to the question of Federal officials' records generally, but not on this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.946" offset="9264307">There was no opportunity other than statements made on the floor of the Senate, just assertions, which were picked up by the District Court in this case, to the notion that Mr. Nixon is an unreliable custodian for historical purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.791" offset="9315716">And we submit that what the bill-of-attainder clause says is that the Congress may not make that ultimate factual finding, and here it has done it, it has mentioned Richard Nixon by name.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.631" offset="9363050">Congress did not even dare do anything in the Brown case and this Court has mentioned that certainly Archie Brown has been mentioned by name as someone who could not occupy a union office; that would be a bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.543" offset="9406622">And here, Congress has said Richard Nixon is the person who cannot decide which papers are confidential and which papers are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.932" offset="9432222">That aspect of the Presidency and what carries on with it after the President leaves office is taken away from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.485" offset="9462420">Now, Mr. Chief Justice, I suppose your suggestion was that there was an effect on the bill of attainder, because he has also been deprived of ownership of these papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.267" offset="9513620">I think that may very well be true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.169" offset="9521143">In addition to that, he has been deprived of custody, of access, of any meaningful opportunity to have those documents in the way that former Presidents have, and the Archie Brown case also says that even preventive purposes, even entirely preventive purposes, are punishment within the meaning of the bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.671" offset="9607138">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2388.812" offset="9655726">This appeal requires the Court to determine whether the Presidential Recordings and Material Preservation Act that provide for the impoundment and classification by officials of the Executive Branch of certain materials generated during the Administration of the former President and left by him temporarily in the White House following his resignation facially offends the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.428" offset="9782263">We emphasis "facially", because the act became effective on December 19, 1974, and this action for a declaratory judgment and other relief was filed December 20th, before any action was taken under the statute.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="2437.937" offset="9852271">Mr. Solicitor General, I think that the question as you put it, you could mean the entire act, is that the question, or is it legitimate to ask whether any section of it is facially unconstitutional?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wade_h_mccree_jr" startTime="2454.200" stopTime="2665.516">
            <label>Mr. Wade H. McCree, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="2454.200" offset="9917264">I believe my answer to that, Mr. Justice White, is, the Appellant contends that the act is invalid in many respects; but our response is that there is a severability clause, and in the event this Court should find a provision of it invalid, it would not invalidate the entire legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.818" offset="10011723">Appellant contends that the act violates the principle of the separation of powers, the  prohibition against bills of attainder and his right to privacy and liberty of political expression and association.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.999" offset="10064490">The Government submits that the Congress acted constitutionally and that the judgment of the District Court should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.528" offset="10098658">As my brother has pointed out, the act requires the Administrator of General Services to take possession and complete control of the materials to prevent their destruction except as required by law; to make them available for use in any judicial proceeding or otherwise subject to legal process, subject to any rights, defenses or privileges that any one, including the former President, might raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.248" offset="10221538">The Act also requires the Administrator of General Services to afford former President Richard M. Nixon access at all times consistent with the Act and to afford access to the Executive Branch, and I stress Executive Branch, for lawful Government use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.735" offset="10303458">And then, of course, it requires the issuance of regulations to prevent loss and destruction and ultimately to submit to the Congress regulations relating to public access, and I stress the distinction between the two sets of regulations, taking into account seven enumerated factors denominated as needs, which I suggest we need not discuss in detail, because these regulations had not been promulgated at the time of the attack on the statute was made, have not yet taken place, because they require Congressional acquiescence to become effective, and that acquiescence in the two efforts that were attempted was not forthcoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.080" offset="10492794">Finally, the act provides for the appropriation of money if a court should determine that a provision of the legislation should deprive an individual of private property without just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.603" offset="10546919">And so at this point I reiterate, since there are no regulations providing for public access and only regulations for safekeeping, which are not before the Court, as my brother indicated, and are not part of the record here, because indeed the Appellant has not claimed that they breach any rights of his.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.020" offset="10632601">We suggest respectfully that this Court should limit its inquiry to the face of the statute and should not be concerned with the many hypothetical horrors, as the District Court characterized them, that Appellant suggests might occur at some future time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2651.181" offset="10705221">We suggest the proper time to consider these hobgoblins may be when the public-access regulations will have been promulgated and will have become effective, and there will have been decisions with respect to particular materials.</text>

            <text syncTime="3676.736" offset="14807491">The difference is, under the Presidential Libraries Act, previous Presidents have been permitted to, or no one has tried to stop them, have indeed established conditions concerning access to their papers provided for periods of time when they will be closed to everyone and provided various methods for access and release.</text>

            <text syncTime="4076.130" offset="16405035">And so facially the Act protects these interests about which my brother expressed so much concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="4086.923" offset="16448190">Finally, we suggest that the commingling of these papers was the act of the former President, and for him to suggest that the Fourth Amendment prevents the sifting of these papers to determine what are clearly his private papers and what are papers pertaining to matters in the public interest to which the Executive Branch should have access is something of his doing and that he should not be heard to complain about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.093" offset="16584862">The Fourth Amendment bars unreasonable searches, and the Government submits that the imperatives of national security and other aspects of the public interest make such an inspection eminently reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="4521.687" offset="18187213">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4526.713" offset="18207380">As you know, we are appearing on behalf of distinguished national organizations of historians, political scientists, reporters and various prominent members thereof, also a separate group of interveners, the Committee for Public Justice, and prominent members thereof, and a separate group for reporter Jack Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="4548.534" offset="18294629">The national organizations include the American Historical Association and the American Political Science Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="4556.526" offset="18326603">Now, I would like to make one thing very clear, and that is that there has been no question in this case raised by any of the interveners or the Government concerning Mr. Nixon’s entitlement to the return of his personal materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.905" offset="18400163">This includes diaries; it includes conversations with his family; any personal property of any kind not involving the actual transaction of Government business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4589.072" offset="18456797">No issue of this sort was raised in the previous case before this statute was adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="4596.085" offset="18484800">The groups I represented brought suit against the Administrator to enjoin enforcement of the Nixon-Sampson Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4604.321" offset="18517819">In the very initial complaint that was filed in that case, it was made clear that all parties acknowledged the personal records should go back to Mr. Nixon.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="4614.616" stopTime="4635.197">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="4614.616" offset="18558988">But as a result of this legislation, there has been almost a three-year delay so far in his getting possession of what are entirely personal property, personally confidential documents and property.</text>
            <text syncTime="4631.302" offset="18625757">The delay is not over yet.</text>

            <text syncTime="4638.251" offset="18653551">May I address first the question of delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="4640.137" offset="18661074">I think that has been very regrettable for us, also, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4644.378" offset="18678002">There has also been a delay in, of course, getting access to the Governmental materials that might otherwise have been made available for public access under normal circumstances; for instance, if these were treated as other Government materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="4660.491" offset="18742472">The delay, I think, has been caused by the fact that the other litigation was well along and actually resulted into a decision by Judge Richey, but that was stayed in favor of the litigation concerning this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.424" offset="18806211">So it is simply one of the costs of litigation, which we regret, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="4680.646" offset="18823034">But there is just no question about the return of personal diaries, Dictabelts, so long as they are not the materials involved in the transaction of Government business.</text>
            <text syncTime="4691.104" offset="18864934">Now, the statute, I agree, could have been drafted a little more clearly; but we think there are several points which make it quite clear that his personal materials are to be returned to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4704.903" offset="18920105">One is the fact that statute refers to the Presidential historical materials of Richard Nixon, not to the personal or private materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="4715.023" offset="18960542">The second is that as Judge McCree mentioned, Criterion 7 calls for a return of materials to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="4724.297" offset="18997636">And if you read those two in conjunction with the legislative history, there are statements on the floor of the Senate, on the floor of the House and in Committee reports indicating the expectation that Nixon’s personal records would be returned to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="6076.953" offset="24408327">What we are talking about is a man’s life for five-and-a-half years, acting as President of the United States, meeting with his associates and his subordinates, obtaining advice from them, meeting with foreign officials, determining the conduct of the foreign policy of the United States, talking with his wife, talking with his daughter the day before she was married, and what discussions were recorded.</text>
            <text syncTime="6101.293" offset="24505711">But these are the sum and substance of what we talking about.</text>

            <text syncTime="6110.838" offset="24543850">That is a figure that should not even be as a part of a record in terms of what the gut issues of this case are, because we are talking about a gross violation of the Fourth Amendment that will take effect forthwith, because the Section 102(b) gives access to Agencies or Departments of the United States; they can review these records.</text>
            <text syncTime="6138.017" offset="24652519">And let me disabuse the Court if I may of one thing, and that is the commingling argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="6143.790" offset="24675612">Those records were commingled, because for 200 years the Presidents of the United States had a right to expect the right to control in the privacy of their papers.</text>
