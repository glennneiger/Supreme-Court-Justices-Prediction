            <text syncTime="16.001" offset="164607">The issue is whether Title 19 of the Social Security Act requires States that participate in Medicaid programs define the cost of non-therapeutic abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.046" offset="216747">The Federal Act establishes a program supported by state and federal funds under which States may provide medical assistance to needy persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.111" offset="261051">The Act requires States to fund several general categories of medical aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.560" offset="286860">But it expressly authorizes the States to determine the extent of care pursuant to reasonable standards consistent with the objectives of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.662" offset="331268">The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concluded the Pennsylvania regulation which denied funding for non-therapeutic abortions was inconsistent with the Federal Act. We take a different view.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.945" offset="392395">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we conclude that Pennsylvania's regulation comports fully with the Act's objective of providing assistance for necessary medical services.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.836" offset="447983">We conclude further that the exclusion of non-therapeutic abortions was reasonable within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.799" offset="483823">Accordingly, we reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.530" offset="498765">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed his dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Blackmun have joined, Mr. Justice Marshall also has filed a dissenting opinion and Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed such an opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall have joined.</text>
