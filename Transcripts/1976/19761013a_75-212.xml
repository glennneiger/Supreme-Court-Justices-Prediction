            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="12.493" offset="150476">Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.879" offset="163955">This case is here on the government?s petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which affirmed an order of the District Court, suppressing certain evidence obtained during wire interceptions as the five respondents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.829" offset="227799">There are two separate issues, one of which relates to three of the respondents? and concerns the obligations of the government to identify certain persons in the application and of the Court to identify them in the order authorizing the wire interception.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.793" offset="299688">The second concerns the obligation of the government to supply names to the District Court for purposes of discretionary service of inventory notice after an interception has terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.977" offset="348380">And underlying both these issues, assuming the government did not live up to its responsibilities under the statute is a question whether suppression of the evidence is an appropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.215" offset="393310">In November 1972, a Federal District Judge in Cleveland authorized the interception of wire communications relating to gambling offenses over four telephones.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.632" offset="435002">The application for this authorization was supported by an extensive affidavit, which takes up 48 pages of the appendix in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.470" offset="470319">The principle targets of the investigation were three suspected bookmakers, Kotoch, Spaganlo, and Florea, and both the application and the court order named them as well as three other individuals who were expected to be overheard during the interceptions discussing the gambling enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.908" offset="548060">Several weeks after the termination of the initial interception, application was made to the Court for authorization for an extension of the interception on two of the four original phones and also for monitoring of the third phone.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.954" offset="600305">The application and order named two new persons and deleted the names of three individuals who had been identified in the first go around.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.833" offset="635831">Respondents? Donovan, Robbins and Buzzacco were not specifically identified in either, the application or order, original or extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.533" offset="678568">The district court in a suppression hearing, upon review of various items or information in the government?s possession of the time, the renewal application was filed, determined that there was in fact probable cause to believe that these respondents would be overheard discussing illegal gambling conversations during the second interception and because they have not been identified in the application and order, the District Court suppressed their conversations from use in evidence against them, the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.142" offset="793088">As to respondents Merlo and Lauer, there is no question about the initial propriety of the overhearing of their conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.174" offset="825167">However, after the interception was completed, the government supplied the authorizing judge with the names of 37 persons who had been identified as being overheard during their surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.509" offset="878561">Service of inventories on these persons was ordered by the Court and was carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.903" offset="896115">Subsequently, the government realized that it had omitted to inform the judge of the identities of two other persons and it obtained an amended order and served additional inventories.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.538" offset="942613">However, Merlo and Lauer were not named to the judge and did not receive a service of inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.956" offset="976259">They were thereafter indicted and after the indictment, they as well as all the other defendants were given access to the orders, the application and the transcripts of the intercepted conversations.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.973" offset="1024324">Everybody had access at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.741" offset="1039475">The District Court ordered suppression of the intercepting conversation of Merlo and Lauer because if the government?s failure to supply their names to the judge, so that the judge could determine whether discretionary notice of the taps should be served upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.371" offset="1093914">The Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.788" offset="1103632">Neither court below found at the failure to supply the names for inventory purposes was anything other then inadvertent or that these respondents did not in fact know long before they were indicted that they had been overheard, or that there was any prejudice to them as a result of the delay in official notification of the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.523" offset="1178551">Decision of the Court of Appeals stands rather for an absolute rule requiring suppression regardless of lack of governmental misconduct or prejudiced self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.238" offset="1225467">Now, of the two issues before the Court, the one concerning the identification of persons in the application and orders by far the most important to the future administration of the Act and it is to that issue that I plan to devote the bulk of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.301" offset="1281683">The inventory issue was less important.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.614" offset="1290982">It is now the government?s policy, even though we do not believe the Act compels us to do so, to supply the supervising judge with the names of all overheard persons as to whom we believe there is any reasonable prospect of indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.013" offset="1344481">Perhaps the approach of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which suggested that rather than submitting specific names, we should submit categories of persons who had been overheard is a better policy would be more helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.388" offset="1397980">The District Court in exercising its discretion and we would have no objection to following any reasonable policy that the District Courts determine would be useful to them in this area.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="334.730" offset="1439358">As to the inventory notice?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="335.938" stopTime="503.136">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="335.938" offset="1444269">As to the inventory notice, that is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.757" offset="1459524">However, whatever the rules may be, suppression of the evidence is an inappropriate and unauthorized response in these cases and it is on that point that I want to make a few brief observations before I turn to the identification question.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.999" offset="1524517">First of all section 2518 (10) (a) which is the suppression provision and which has set forth, I believe at page 5(a) of the appendix to our brief, authorizes District Courts to suppress, on one of three grounds; that the communication was unlawfully intercepted, that the order of authorization or approval was insufficient on its face, or that the interception was not made in conformity with the order and none of these grounds is applicable to a postintercept failure to comply with the procedures that follow and it is our argument that you cannot suppress under the statute for a failure to comply with post intercept procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.832" offset="1711763">Now, I point out in this connection that we at Congress wish to exclude evidence for postintercept defects, it is specifically so provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.908" offset="1752096">For example, Section 2518 (8) (a) which is not in the appendix, concerns the sealing and it provides that after the interception is terminated, the tapes must be turned over promptly to the District Court for sealing and it further provides that the absence of seal called for in that Section or satisfactory explanation for the absence means that the evidence is to be excluded, that is a specific exclusionary rule dealing with a postintercept failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.188" offset="1885216">Similarly and more directly in point in this case is Section 2518 (9) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.988" offset="1916458">That is the provision that sets forth the congressional requirement of notice and to see them to the admission of evidence in a case that is notice to the defendant of the fact that he has been intercepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.099" offset="1976853">That provision says that the contents of any intercepted wire or oral communication or evidence derived there from shall not be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed, unless each party not less than ten days before the trial hearing or preceding has been furnished with a copy of the court order accompanying application etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.145" offset="2061072">That is congress had said, what is necessary, respondents Merlo and Lauer have gotten the information that is necessary, it is still more then ten days before their trial, we think there is no ground, therefore, for excluding.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="503.136" offset="2113003">And this never did go to trial that it because of District Court (Voice Overlap).</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="505.543" offset="2122617">Not as to these respondents, they were served.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.329" offset="2137768">One final point in discussing the Giordano, Chavez analysis here, of course the Courts have focused on the question of centrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.484" offset="2174443">Now, we do not deny that the inventory notice concept is a central part of the statute, but that to us does not answer the question that must be answered before determining whether to suppress and that is whether the particular kind of defect in the procedures is itself so central to the statute, that is here whether the fact that only 39 people rather than 41 people were named is so central to the statute in the absence to prejudice to the defendants, that suppression is an appropriate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.689" offset="2303279">We say clearly is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.642" offset="2315087">Now turning to the naming issue; the Court of Appeals held that the government?s obligation to identify extends to all persons whom a government has probable cause to believe at well over here talking over the monitored telephones about the criminal activities under investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.396" offset="2390110">We submit that the language and structure of the Act, its legislative history and substantial policy considerations dictate a much never interpretation of that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.874" offset="2435981">I would like to begin by saying a word about the dictum in Kahn because several Courts of Appeals that have examined this question have really stopped their inquiry after they looked at the dictum in Kahn.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.114" offset="2480912">Kahn was a very different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.713" offset="2491361">Kahn concerned the question of who among the people whose phone was being monitored had to be named in the order and Kahn held that the only where you have probable cause that you have the name somebody who?s phone was being intercepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.796" offset="2551652">Kahn did not concern the question of your responsibilities to name people who are calling into the intercepted phone from phones that are not themselves being monitored.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.628" offset="2590940">It was not briefed.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.786" offset="2595642">It was not argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.105" offset="2600866">It was not necessary of the Court?s decision and I do not think a fair reading of the Kahn dictum suggests that the issue was in anyway for (Voice Overlap).</text>

            <text syncTime="763.593" offset="3154871">Now, the first thing to notice, I have stressed, is the singular were the person in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.807" offset="3179740">Now, in the New York statute which was the model for this particular provision in a federal statute and which is quoted cited in Berger, in the opinion in Berger, the New York statute provided the person or persons had to be identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.193" offset="3237209">Congress dropped four persons out of the federal statute only the person need be identified.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.492" offset="3266466">Now we think if the congressional notion was it they would be one target in these cases that it would be the target?s phone that would be monitored and that that was the person who should be named, if that person was known.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.818" offset="3315786">The critical distinction and its one we believe is clearly built into the statute and it is when we urge the Court to recognize in its decision, is between the users of the telephone that is being monitored on the one hand and all other persons throughout the world who make converse from unmonitored phones on the other hand, the naming of requirement applies to former in our view and not to the later.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.976" offset="3408363">Now, there is internal evidence in the statute, I think that supports this quite clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.095" offset="3432814">If you look at page 2 (a) of the appendix to our brief and 3 (a) we set forth there Subsection 2518 (3) which talks about what the judge must find in determining the issue on authorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.079" offset="3508778">A Subsection (a) says the judge must find that there is probable cause for belief that an individual is committing, has committed, or is about to commit a particular offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.208" offset="3553291">Subsection (d) which ties in with this says that and I am going to edit it slightly, there is probable cause for belief that the facilities from which, or the place where the wire communications are to be intercepted that those facilities are being used or about to be used in connection with the commission of such offense, or are leased to, listed in the name of, or commonly used by such person.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.026" offset="3656631">Now, the such person that Congress was talking about there was the individual who has committed the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.492" offset="3682440">The structure of the statute ties a particular individual, a particular telephone, a particular offense and we think that, that is further reinforced by Subsection four which deals with what the contents of the ?authorizing order shall include?.</text>

            <text syncTime="1230.431" offset="5022208">So, that this distinction between callers in from outside and callers out from the monitored phone, is I think built into the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1324.661" offset="5399103">Now, I just like to say a word a two about the policy considerations because the broad interpretation of the Court of Appeals accomplishes very little by way of protecting against unjustified intrusions and for the privacy of persons who maybe overheard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.483" offset="5466394">The statutory scheme does not limit the scope of permissible ?authorized overhearing in terms of the identities of the persons who maybe overheard? but rather in terms of the kinds of conversations that may be overheard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1440.282" offset="5861575">They said, then the Court said at page 59 of the opinion in Berger 388 U.S, it is true that statute requires the naming of the person or persons whose communications are to be overheard or recorded, but this does no more then identify the person whose constitutionally protected area is to be invaded, rather then particularly describing the communications, conversations or discussions to be seized, and in Kahn again the court recognizes that there is not Congress was wrong, there is not a constitutional obligation to the name.</text>

            <text syncTime="1505.516" offset="6122590">Well, the reason why it should not, there is a practical reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.001" offset="6140458">I mean there are several practical reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.710" offset="6147354">You have a case like this which is a complex gambling conspiracy case with people actually all over the country transmitting line information, lying of bets, you although hear many, many persons it is a fast moving investigation and then you are telling the government that it has to engage in what essentially is a quite metaphysical evaluation of all the information in its possession so that it can tell the District Court that it has or it has not probable cause to believe that it will overhear certain persons and what it tells to District Court, what is the District Court to do with that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.788" offset="6295626">If the government has no probable cause, if the district court disagrees with the government then it strikes the name from the order and then we can although hear that person as a person unknown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.574" offset="6342750">So it gives the person no protection to be stricken from the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.787" offset="6355603">It does nothing except it has a lot of work to the District Court and if we name someone who is at a borderline case and we will be forced to a policy of over inclusion if we loose this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.568" offset="6402728">We will be naming some people who will not be overheard and then when a suppression motion comes about and the intercept order and application are opened up these people will have in effect the famatory information unsupported by the actual result of the tap made public that they were suspected by the government of participating in criminal gambling enterprises, narcotics and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.342" offset="6489872">So even in terms of, I mean the naming just does not serve a substantial interest of the individuals nor does it further the policy of the act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.269" offset="6641591">Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.672" offset="6671162">My colleague Mr. Policy and I represent five defendants in the gambling indictment whose telephone conversations were intercepted by the government for use as evidence at their trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.520" offset="6710554">The district courts suppressed these intercepts because they were obtained in violation of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.064" offset="6748693">My clients Mr. Merlo and Mr. Lauer, because they never received inventory notice of the intercepts as required by 18 United State Code Section 2518 (8)(d) which I shall refer to as 8(d) of the Act and Mr. Policy?s clients because they were not identified in the application for authorization, for the tap even though they were known to the government as required by 18 United States Code Section 1218 (1)(b)(4) which if I have occasion to refer it to again will be as 1(b)4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.989" offset="6892471">Both of these suppressions were affirmed by the sixth circuit court of appeals and I intent to urge in my portion of the argument that the suppression of the wiretap evidence against my clients was appropriate, proper and necessary because of the government?s violation of Title III 8(d) and after that my colleague will argue for affirmnace of the suppression as to his clients because of the government?s of the Title III violation of 1(b)4.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.272" offset="7017546">It seems to me, that at the outset it is important to identify a couple of facts which have become a obscured or muddied as a result of the briefs and the descending opinion in the Court of Appeals below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.863" offset="7083897">One of the things that I think must be clarified is that there never was any actual notice to defendants Merlo and Lauer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.722" offset="7127364">The trial court have heard the evidence and had an opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses made a specific finding that no inventory notice was ever served upon Merlo and Lauer nor did they receive notice in any other way and that finding by the trail court was commented upon by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and the majority opinion of the view that the fact that 37 other people were notified would at least give the defendants a feeling that they had not been intercepted because they had failed to receive any inventory notice as required by Section 8 (d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.534" offset="7282636">So there is so far as this case is concerned, it is clear that this is not a situation in which only a technical violation, the failure to serve an inventory notice occurred in the record but in fact up until the time they were indicted some 11 months later and until they actually received the information as a result of their discovery applications they had no such actual notice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1845.670" offset="7483152">I am sorry, the majority opinion did comment on the finding my trial court that they have not received the actual notice and further speculated in their opinion that far from the suggestion that because 37 other people had been notified, somehow by word of mouth, they must have had actual notice in someway of the interception, said that it is ambiguous and that it is just as likely that because the others had received the actual notice and they had not that they were entitled to assume that they were not intercepted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.325" offset="8037784">The second fact that I believe needs to be dealt with is the question of when it was that Mr. Merlo and Mr. Lauer?s identity were known to the government sufficient to cause them to be required to serve an inventory notice upon these particular defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.162" offset="8125137">And I believe in the descending opinion of the Court of Appeals that judge indicated that somehow or rather that information did not come until August, about two months, two or three months prior to the time that the second inventory adding a couple of more people was actually filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.134" offset="8213013">I believe that, that represents a misreading of the record with all due respect.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard A. Berkman</label>
            <text syncTime="2040.658" offset="8263064">That does appear, Mr. Gail, a special agent for the FBI did so testify and in the next few lines it becomes abundantly clear the reason that he, the question was put as to when he became cognizant of fact that these people were identified not only as individuals who had been on the telephone, but also individuals who were perhaps involved in the crime that they were investigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.059" offset="8360762">The reason that he became aware of that in August of 1973 was because of the fact that he had just been assigned that case at that time and he conceded in the next couple of pages and this appears at approximately 160 to 165 in the appendix, he conceded that in fact by January 13, a physical search and seizure was made of the premises on which Mr. Lauer and Mr. Merlo were found, that is a part of the problem cause that was assigned in that affidavit support of that warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.593" offset="8510809">The telephone information which had been optioned was employed. That at time physical evidence was seized which was going to be introduced and some very critical admissions were obtained from Mr. Merlo and Lauer with respect to the fact that they were the people who were on the telephone and that they were the people who had rented the telephone in another name and he conceded I think quite honestly that as of that time and certainly by the 18th of January, all of the reports of the raid, all of the evidence seized, all of the reports of the admissions of these people were in the hands of the responsible people in the government, particularly FBI agents who were working with the strike force.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.588" offset="8670783">And so it seems to me that there is no way to read this record except to find that at least by January 18, the government had full knowledge of the identity and participation of these two individuals and yet from then until December, from January to December and after the time of indictment these people were never served with inventory notice, nor received notice of any kind and that is what the record suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.961" offset="8760331">And so I think that when the Court in the Sixth Circuit, the dissenting Judge found that there was no knowledge until August.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.048" offset="8796693">I think he was bringing the rest of the record and I think it is very clear and I think Mr. Gail makes clear that the reason that he just learned the part was because he was a young lawyer who had just been assigned to the case and that the government did have this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.682" offset="8855208">In addition to that, there was some talk about the inadvertence of the failure to serve inventory notice upon Mr. Merlo and Mr. Lauer and I think that there is nothing in the record to indicate that the failure to do so was inadvertent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.307" offset="8949666">One of the difficulties of attempting to find out from the government so far as the defendant?s standpoint is concerned as to the reasons for what occurred is of course that all of the facts are within the control of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.928" offset="9008181">What we know from the record is to that from January 13th or January 18th of 1973 until December there was never any notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.469" offset="9066381">That when they combed the record in September 1973 to find other people, they found the couple of other people, but did not identify Merlo and Laure and it seems to me that the best place that can be put upon is record, is to suggest that as a result of sloppiness, as a result of negligence of the government these two people were not identified, that is the best the pace can be put on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.921" offset="9152168">It seems to me under those circumstances to allow an absolute and total failure to perform the duties that are required under the 8(d) the statute, puts a burden upon the defendants in terms of finding out why it was that it was not done which I think Congress never intended with the strict responsibilities that are necessary in implementing the limitation provisions of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2319.381" offset="9377970">The other branch would be to say that we read Giordano and Chavez correctly that if we are dealing with a central issue or central subject of the Act which was designed to limit the inappropriate use of interception of communications as we think that this clearly is that under that case as explained by Chavez whether or not the government has been guilty of any wrong doing either negligent or deliberate that because of its internality and because of the importance involved in making sure that the government follows in strict way every limitation that has been put upon them by the statute that regardless of any wrong doing or negligence by the government that suppression would be appropriate in necessary remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2387.748" offset="9651420">It seems to me to be quite clear if we analyze the statute itself and if we analyze the legislative history of the statute that because of the necessity of surreptitious entry or surreptitious search and seizure as that term is applied to wire that, it is impossible to give the advance notice that the invasion of the client?s privacy or the invasion of the defendants? privacy is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.358" offset="9749954">As a consequence, the postintercept procedures have been clearly set out to make sure that ultimately disclosure of these secret intrusions is made and to be made in a reasonable time thereafter, not immediately necessarily, but at a reasonable time thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.598" offset="9826858">It seems to me that in the government?s discussion of the whole problem of suppression there was no mention at all of Section 2515 which very clearly indicates that suppression is appropriate, when there has been a violation of this chapter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.548" offset="9894672">It seems to me that, that and the legislative history surrounding that which is reported in detail in the Gilbert decision makes quite clear that is was important, so far as the government was concerned, so far as Congress was concerned, to make sure that a number of remedies were available in the event that there was a violation of the limitations of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.908" offset="10016089">Criminal provisions were provided in 2511, a civil suit was provided in 2520 and if you review the legislative history it makes clear that, that coupled with the requirement that the government not be able to use the fruits of it violations makes it very clear that, that was the intent of Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="3050.613" offset="12302953">Both of those keys, and I feel that the reading of Kahn tells us and logically dictates, that were Minnie Kahn, in fact known, prior to the application being sought to have been engaging in this activity and probably using her husband?s phone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.910" offset="12372125">I feel that this Honorable Court would have gone farther on the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.773" offset="12387590">I would have stated that the statute would have required her being listed in said application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.812" offset="12415697">I feel Mr. Chief Justice, Justices that we have a definite statutory violation here and when we look the Giordano, we are told that a statutory violation shall result in suppression when it hits that central aspect of the statute and when it hits an aspect of the statute which was designed by Congress to limit the use of this tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.906" offset="12520083">Now, I submit that in Berger and Katz, two of the key cases in this situation that Courts were concerned with interjecting and between law enforcement (Inaudible) wiretapping tool some judicial restraint or at least judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.659" offset="12591136">And I feel this is obvious in Congress? intent and by allowing the government to come forward and go to a District Court judge without providing him with the information as to the identity of those people that it has probable cause to believe will be intercepted and are probably committing this crime, they are bypassing, utilizing their own judgment in terms of that decision making process and taking away what Berger, Katz and Congress had intended to be some judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.189" offset="12709209">I further submit Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. Justices that there is a practical effect to not being named in this particular application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.174" offset="12745154">As we read on in the Section 2518 8 requires inventory notice to be served upon all those named in the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.281" offset="12793637">Now, this is regardless of whether or not the application is denied, by placing this man?s name, who is a suspect upon whom probable cause exists in the application, he is guaranteed receipt of the inventory notice and is not subjected to the arbitrariness or to the discretionary activity that could go into effect otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.949" offset="12884230">I submit that if a innocent man with a subject of an investigation, he would preferred to know this even though his exonerated rather than have the entire process kept secret throughout and only in the hands and only in the files of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.389" offset="12950058">I would say further that recognizing the existence of Chavez and comparing it to the Doctrine of Giordano; we certainly have a situation with the identification issue which is closer to suppression than the Chavez situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.646" offset="13023097">I would even submit to this Honorable Court that the identification issue is as key and as central as the Giordano issue, because here we are dealing with the situation that goes to the merits of the probable cause aspects of these applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.909" offset="13084119">Here we are getting again to the heart of what Berger, Katz and Congress had sought in the form of judicial review, judicial restraint.</text>

            <text syncTime="3269.549" offset="13178682">Without addressing myself to whether not it is a constitutional requirement, I submit that the statute in question Your Honor has been based upon the rulings of Berger and Katz and I am submitting that the reference in Berger that was made by Mr. Frey at page 59 relating to naming of a person as being the requirement was a reference that the government in effect for the State of New York was attempting to say, look we have a naming requirement that should be enough to save the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3301.031" offset="13304592">I think it was the State of New York?s opinion at that point and effort at that point to say, this is such an important key issue, this naming requirement, it is there, the statute should survive, whereas I believe this Honorable Court indicated that that was not in and of itself enough.</text>

            <text syncTime="3324.324" offset="13397797">I would submit that as a secondary argument it would be a constitutionally required rule to have a man, who the government knows in advance will be searched, whose conversations will be seized, named in an application for a warrant for a wiretap and at the failure, the failure to go so far as to simply name this individual and provide the aspects of probable cause to the judicial officer, who would review the same, would be actually a violation of constitutional standards as well as a violation of the statutory standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="3361.504" offset="13546486">Your Honor as I recall the Kahn language, I felt that Kahn was saying and did say that the requirement was statutory or the fact that she was not known, there was no probable cause to know that she was committing these offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.074" offset="13612732">Therefore, a statutory violation did not come into effect and I believe that this covered the constitutional aspect and did not allow it to come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.752" offset="13655469">I would submit that in Kahn again, had the government known of Mrs. Kahn?s identity and the fact that she engaged in this illegal activity, statutory and constitutional consideration would have come into play.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="3407.381" offset="13729970">I have a couple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.080" offset="13756824">First of all, I want to come back to a point that was apparently troubling in Mr. Justice Stevens about why Congress would want to make it distinction between the people whose phone was being monitored and people calling in from outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.223" offset="13805412">One of the important reasons is that the impact of a wire interception differs greatly on the people, whose phone is being intercepted, whose every conversation is subject to being overheard and the people who may occasionally, once or twice during the course of a surveillance that involves several 100 telephone calls being listened to, maybe overheard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.877" offset="13896004">There is a much greater impact upon the person whose phone is being intercepted and for that reason it is logical for Congress to have made the distinction that we submitted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3457.605" stopTime="3466.199">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3457.605" offset="13930904">Doesn?t the distinction tend to disappear as the second person?s use of the phone becomes more and more regular and frequent?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="3466.199" stopTime="3478.436">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="3466.199" offset="13965281">Yes, I mean if we had a case where the primary target of our investigation was somebody who we knew everyday was calling in from outside, you might have an issue, but these Donovan, Robbins and Buzzacco were very tangentially?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3478.436" stopTime="3488.720">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3478.436" offset="14014182">Or a case where you trying prove the five-man crime and you know all five people used the same phone over and over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.594" offset="14046888">Even there you would not say they had to name more than one.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="3488.720" stopTime="3539.942">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="3488.720" offset="14055351">Well, I would first say that you did not have to name more than one, but second I would say if you did have to name more than one, if all five used the phone it was being monitored, you might have to name them, but the people with whom they were doing business, people from Las Vegas sending the line information would not have to be named even though we expect to overhear them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.461" offset="14126300">Now, as far as the point that Mr. Policy was just making, we do not need either under the constitution or under the statute probable cause as to any person in order to have the interception.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.455" offset="14182306">All we need is probable cause to believe that an offense is being committed and at this telephone has being used and the conversations relating to the act will be intercepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.570" offset="14218773">There can be no person. The statute does not require us to name a person if we do not know one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.626" offset="14238940">It is neither a constitutional or statutory requirement, and it is plainly I think for that reason not central.</text>

            <text syncTime="3539.942" offset="14260256">But on the reverse side of that as soon as you do have probable cause then you should name him, should you not, under the statute?</text>

            <text syncTime="3547.027" offset="14288572">Well, the statute requires us to identify, yes, we could see that, we have to identify a person whose phone is being tapped.</text>

            <text syncTime="3609.865" offset="14539975">Well, it is not irrelevant to him, that he is been overheard and that evidence would be introduced against him and of course the conversations are not irrelevant to the trial, but in terms of the privacy concerns that the Title III is concerned with since we can overhear as Justice Marshall pointed it out, people of whom we have no suspicion, the privacy concerns are not, it is not relevant to protecting people?s privacy and if it is not relevant for that reason, we say it is not central to the Act and the Court should not go out of its way to construe the statute to impose what is an administratively burdensome requirement which will make life also very difficult for judges who already have 46 page applications to read over and we have 146 page applications if we have to show all the probable cause we have with a far flung conspiracy as to every person around the country.</text>
