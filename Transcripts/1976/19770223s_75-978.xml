            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="16.905" offset="168154">These cases arise under the 1972 amendments to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and come here by way of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.982" offset="212458">The petitioners are eight chemical companies that filed actions challenging regulations issued by the Environmental Protection Agency which said uniform limits on the discharge of pollutants by categories or classes of plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.311" offset="269718">Petitioners contend that the EPA does not have the authority to issue a binding regulation, but rather, only has the authority to issue flexible guidelines for use in considering the individual characteristics of each plant when a permanent is issued for that plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.620" offset="335024">We now hold that the EPA has the power it has claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.584" offset="350802">Because of the way the statute structures judicial review, our holding has the effect of allowing direct review of these EPA regulations in the United States Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.095" offset="392911">The First Circuit correctly analyzed these issues and we affirm that part of its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.152" offset="413078">In another of its decision, that Court held that EPA's standard for plants which will be built in the future, must contain a variance provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.603" offset="446933">We hold that Congress did not contemplate such variances for new plants and we therefore, unanimously reverse this part of the Fourth Circuit's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.531" offset="482668">Mr .Justice Powell took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</text>
