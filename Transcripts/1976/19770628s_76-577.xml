            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="10.209" offset="141475">This case is here from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.657" offset="159343">It arose when Hugo Zacchini, an entertainer, sued the Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.475" offset="194556">The operator of a television station claiming that he has rights under the Ohio law privacy had been violated when the station had broadcast a film of his performance without his consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.333" offset="250040">Zacchini, interestingly enough has called the "human cannonball".</text>
            <text syncTime="41.175" offset="265400">His entire act consist of being shot from a cannon into a net some 200 feet away.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.364" offset="294135">This dispute came about when Zacchini who had been hired to perform on a regular basis at a county fair in Ohio objected to his act being filmed by a television reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.697" offset="359441">The film was made anyway and it was shown on the stations evening broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.959" offset="384518">Zacchini sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.872" offset="392146">Under the Ohio privacy law, an entertainer has what is called the "right of publicity."</text>
            <text syncTime="79.704" offset="419522">That is the exclusive right to publicized and commercially exploit his performances as well as his name and his likeness.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.946" offset="472499">The Supreme Court agreed with Zacchini that he had such right and that has been violated, but held that he had no remedy because as it understood the First and Fourteenth Amendments as construed by the cases in this Court, the television station was constitutionally privileged to do what it did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.775" offset="563823">We granted certiorari and we reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.418" offset="578347">None of our cases has reached this situation and we declined to hold that that a television station is constitutionally privileged to broadcast a performer's entire act without his consent, whether it's part of a news broadcast or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.728" offset="643548">Entertainment is important news and thus Scripps-Howard could undoubtedly have broadcast the essential facts of Zacchini's performance as part of its news broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.275" offset="685762">But the First Amendment does not protect the appropriation of an entire act anymore than it would be used for copyright at work.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.021" offset="720766">Ohio need not have extended a right of publicity to Zacchini and even if it did, it could as a matter of its own law constitution or statutory, privileged the press to do what it did here, privileged to television station to broadcast this film.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.836" offset="792028">All we hold is the Fourteenth Amendment in which applies the First to the States does not required the State to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.950" offset="820450">The judgment is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.532" offset="826824">Mr. Justice Powell joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion and Mr. Justice Stevens also dissents.</text>
