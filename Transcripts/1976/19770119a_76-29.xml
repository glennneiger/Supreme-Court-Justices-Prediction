            <label>Mr. Alan W. Perry</label>
            <text syncTime="70.061" offset="381121">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.044" offset="397003">This case is here on appeal from the decision of the Supreme Court of Mississippi, upholding the validity of the state tax laved on interstate commerce and the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.529" offset="450920">I represent Complete Auto, the appellant, which is seeking to recover these taxes from state of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.946" offset="476624">The State of course is a party for this action through Charles office, the Chairman of State Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.003" offset="500866">Complete Auto is a Michigan corporation engaged in transporting new motor vehicles, cars and trucks from the manufacturers and dealers in 48 states, operates pursuant authority granted by the State Commerce Commission does not have any intrastate operating rights from Mississippi Public Service Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.414" offset="578502">It has been engaged in this business in Mississippi since 1940 and engaged in this transporting vehicles from the Jackson, Mississippi railhead round since approximately 1960.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.531" offset="626985">During that period of time, it is has paid substantial income taxes, franchise taxes, ad valorem taxes, license plate fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.208" offset="657705">Since the tax commission’s main contention is that this activity of Complete Auto constituted intrastate commerce, a brief reference to the undisputed facts concerning the activities of Complete Auto in Mississippi and that is to say, Complete Auto is engaged only in the business of transporting new motor vehicles for General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.803" offset="752059">All of the motor vehicles that were transported by Complete Auto manufactured in plants outside the state of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.457" offset="782675">General Motors, pursuant to its obligations to its dealers, was responsible for delivering the motor vehicles to the dealer’s location.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.332" offset="818201">General Motors chose the carriers to make that delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.428" offset="834502">Of course, it is necessary to delivering, a bound carrier of Motorcare carrier since most dealer showrooms not located at Jackson’s railroad tunnel facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.600" offset="871178">In many cases Complete Auto or another motor carrier will transport the vehicles the entire distance from the manufacturing plant to the dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.585" offset="911197">In some case, however, as in the activities with which we particularly concerned, General Motors found it more economical to use a rail carrier for a portion of the journey on the motor carriers such as Complete Auto to complete the delivery to dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.688" offset="979534">General Motors made all the transportation arrangements before the vehicles left the plant, at the time each vehicle left the plant, a label was placed in or on the motor vehicle showing the particular dealer to whom it must be delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.405" offset="1030420">The trial court found as a matter of fact that once the vehicles were delivered to the carrier, that General Motors had nothing whatsoever to do with transportation and the vehicles were in the custody, care and control with the carriers from the time they left the manufacturing plant to the time they left the -- until the time they arrived the dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.659" offset="1107429">The transportation here at issue, a railroad transported the vehicles from the manufacturing plant to a rail ramp in Jackson, Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.103" offset="1141284">In Jackson, the railway transferred the vehicles to Complete Auto which completed the transportation to the dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.981" offset="1172735">Some of the dealers were located inside of Mississippi, some of the dealers were located outside the state of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.537" offset="1202933">At the trial of this case in the appendix are documents illustrative of the transactions we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.660" offset="1227488">They show that for the documents which are in evidence, the vehicles were shipped from manufacturing plant at Atlanta, Georgia by the Southern Railway System to Meridian, Mississippi which is in the eastern portion of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.417" offset="1278479">There they were transferred to the Illinois Central Railroad which carried the vehicles to Jackson, which transferred the vehicles to Complete Auto for continuation to the dealer in the state and out the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.474" offset="1334695">The statute at issue in this case, provides in part as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.387" offset="1354339">There is hereby laved and assessed and shall be collected privilege taxes for the privilege of engaging or continuing in business or doing business and then it describes the tax to be levied pursuant to certain following sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.606" offset="1415256">The particular section with which we are concerned provides in part that upon every person operating at pipeline, airline, bus, truck or other transportation business, but the transportation of persons or property for compensation between points within the state is hereby levied on sales and shall be collected a tax equal to 5% of gross income of such business.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.986" offset="1508775">Acting pursuant to the statutes, the tax commission assessed the tax, against Complete Auto on the gross receipts derived by Complete Auto for transporting the vehicles from Jackson Mississippi to the dealers in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.386" offset="1570423">The State Tax commission did not assess any tax on any portion of the gross receipts earned by Complete Auto in transporting the vehicles from Jackson, Mississippi to dealers in other state.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.745" offset="1623818">The commission’s position in levying this tax has always been that it considers Complete Auto’s activities in continuing this intrastate transportation from the manufacturer to dealer to the intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.208" offset="1681705">It is our position however that the intrastate character of the transaction is clearly demonstrated by the undisputed facts.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="402.901" offset="1712425">Mr. Perry, how long is Mississippi has this statute in its present form?</text>

          <turn speaker="alan_w_perry" startTime="409.272" stopTime="429.682">
            <label>Mr. Alan W. Perry</label>
            <text syncTime="409.272" offset="1737921">The statute was amended to its present form in about 1955, as I recall Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.725" offset="1767700">It had a predecessor’s statute which was in effect at least in 1949 when this court decided Intrastate All Pipeline case, that tax statute was very similar to one now in effect.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="429.682" stopTime="432.799">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="429.682" offset="1819527">Do they all speak in terms of privilege?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_w_perry" startTime="432.799" stopTime="553.339">
            <label>Mr. Alan W. Perry</label>
            <text syncTime="432.799" offset="1832066">Yes sir, the statute prior in 1955 said privilege once, this statute says privilege twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.202" offset="1869682">It is undisputed that the intention of General Motors was that the motor vehicles be transported from manufacturing plant to the dealer.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.363" offset="1902283">It is undisputed that the only break in the transportation was for the purpose of transferring the vehicles from one carrier to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.844" offset="1932167">It is undisputed that after that transfer took place, the transportation to the dealer continued and it is undisputed that General Motors had nothing whatsoever to do with the vehicles after they left its plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.014" offset="1976889">The commission’s position in this seems to be based solely on its contention that it lays the form of the documents, established that this is somehow intrastate commerce and the commission’s brief asserts that this fact is controlling and the form of the documents is the only pertinent fact which this court needs to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.224" offset="2057764">It is undisputed that separate bills of lading or way bills were prepared for the trail for the railway journey and for the truck journey.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.784" offset="2099978">There were separate bills of lading.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.564" offset="2107083">However, it is also undisputed that the reason for that was that the joint tariffs had not been found for the rail carrier, for the truck carrier, since there were no joint tariffs for these two carriers, there could be no joint rights, thus that could be no joint documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.797" offset="2171971">We have cited numerous cases in our brief holding that the form of the bill of lading or the documents not controlling, does not affect the character of the continuity of intrastate movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.904" offset="2216484">We have also cited numerous cases showing that a mere interchange from one carrier to another does not affect an intrastate movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.415" offset="2250443">The lack of merit in the commission’s contention that this court need to look only to the bills of lading, it is clearly evident from the peculiar and inconsistent results which it produces.</text>

            <text syncTime="554.861" offset="2320242">Yes sir and the record, exhibit C5 shows that Complete Auto which is cited in the brief shows that Complete Auto paid that tax, franchise tax, ad valorem taxes and license plate fees of state.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan W. Perry</label>
            <text syncTime="588.971" offset="2456706">Well, that is somewhat akin to the Railway Express case where they merely -- in Railway Express Your Honor there is an earlier decision where this court invalidated that Virginia statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.224" offset="2513757">A few years later after the Virginia legislature had revived the statute the question came up as to whether the amended statute still levied to privilege tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.003" offset="2556807">The court held in a decision as to which there was some reservations in the sense that, yes, that was indeed a property tax or a tax levied in lieu of a property tax, and therefore, it was not a privilege tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.208" offset="2613650">Question was not, exactly free from that as I recall Mr. Justice Brennan expressed some reservations and Mr. Justice Stewart dissented, “I am not sure that merely exercising the words privilege from this tax would make it not a privilege tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.195" offset="2673627">I think that you still have to look and see if the state is contending that it is not levied on the privilege of engaging in business, exactly what answer that is it levied on.”</text>

            <text syncTime="662.133" offset="2749382">Well, of course there is the basic argument that the state does not have the power to exclude a company from engaging exclusive intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.206" offset="2797656">That is perhaps a formal argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.125" offset="2809359">The particular practical problems that such a tax creates, is that a privilege tax is more selective than the other taxes which this court is held, such as an income tax or property tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="749.223" offset="3097751">In that case, it was held that a tax placed on intrastate and intrastate commerce in the form of privilege tax is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.680" offset="3127530">It is not just a tax that is levied on intrastate commerce, it is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.033" offset="3144980">It is one that is levied on interstate and intrastate commerce if that is in fact levied on the privilege in engaging intrastate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="780.553" offset="3223034">In that case tax was reconstructed as a property tax, by making it in lieu of the property tax on certain intangible assets of the carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.139" offset="3265352">I think that if State of Mississippi worked within that same statute, merely exercising the words privilege, one would have to look at, what in fact was being taxed by the statute, looking at the entire structure of the Mississippi taxing system to see if they have in fact found a valid taxable instant upon which they had levied the tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="3432.271" offset="13829898">Yes sir, but the tax is even been repelled now since 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="3436.646" offset="13847452">We are talking about money, we are out of pocket from 1968 to 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.018" offset="13864902">Mr. Justice Marshall asked whether General Motors had anyone present at the point where the vehicles were transferred from the railroad to motor carrier they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.183" offset="13917565">The testimony is clear that they did and the Chancellor, specifically found on page, in his opinion on page 100 of the Appendix, that General Motors had absolutely nothing further do for it to do with the vehicles after they were transported.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.138" offset="13973362">Nevertheless Mr. Haddock said in his brief and, said again here today that somehow or another the transportation ended in Jackson because the consignee was General Motors in care of Complete Auto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.764" offset="14035847">We think in light of undisputed fact that contention has no merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.514" offset="14062910">Finally, with regard to Mr. Haddock’s argument about local activity which he defines as the transportation itself, it seems to me and he calls that a commercial activity, it seems to me that is just another way of saying this was intrastate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.725" offset="14123723">What he tried to carve out is no more than a portion of intrastate journey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.112" offset="14141277">He is conceded this tax is not levied on any such local instances to use of property or purchase of fuel, ownership of property or incidence on which the tax could be validly levied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.848" offset="14192268">That is we submit, it is clear this tax is not levied in any local instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3527.153" offset="14209405">There are number of instances in the State of Mississippi could and does tax.</text>
