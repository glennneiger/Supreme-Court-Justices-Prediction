            <label>Mr. Frank A. Howard</label>
            <text syncTime="14.972" offset="160433">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.831" offset="175793">When the court recessed yesterday, I was attempting to answer Mr. Justice Blackmun’s question which I understood to be whether civilly committed institutional inmates were within the reach of the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.125" offset="240994">I would like to try to arrive at the answer by explaining our theory of the reach of the Eighth Amendment, and why under that theory derived from this court’s decisions, my answer to the question would have to be no.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.041" offset="312674">This court’s decisions have never, in my reading, departed from the historic intent or the literal tax to the amendment which is internally consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.131" offset="361053">It speaks of excessive fines, excessive bails, and cruel and unusual punishments.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.896" offset="392087">The amendment, as we read the court’s decisions, only speaks to punishments which are inflected consequential to or collateral to the criminal process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.558" offset="442764">Corporal punishment in the schools, in our view is no part of the criminal process by any view.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.694" offset="471290">It is civil and correctional therapeutic in nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.086" offset="488844">It is not within the criminal concepts at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.949" offset="508279">The history of the Eight Amendment has been explained too often for me to try to bore the court with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.989" offset="536491">It originated from the imposition of inhumane sentences by the English Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.165" offset="565122">Its interpretation by this Court’s decisions, as uniformly have been in the criminal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.842" offset="591871">In fact, the court has rejected his application in civil cases, in such cases as the deportation, the Fong Yue Ting case, and in a case involving Incarceration for Civil Contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.811" offset="647773">This court has rejected the Eight Amendment as applicable there to give relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.594" offset="670865">The clearest illustration, we believe is in the case which is heavily relied upon by the petitioners and that is Trop v. Dulles.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.943" offset="708273">The distinction can be seen by comparing Trop with its companion case which was decided by this court on the same day in 1958, Perez v. Brownell.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.635" offset="751009">The Nationality Act of 1940 in Perez, stripped Mr. Perez of his citizenship because he voted in a foreign election.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.838" offset="791864">There was no criminal conviction, there was no criminal process.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.459" offset="806389">The court sustain that denationalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.107" offset="824988">In Trop, Mr. Trop had been found guilty by Court Marshall at wartime desertion and the statute there imposed denationalization as a consequence of that conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.540" offset="882666">Chief Justice Warren in the opinion, as we read the opinion, only came to the question of the Eight Amendment, after finding that there was a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.002" offset="924567">The Eight Amendment was invoked by that criminal consequence.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.838" offset="947868">He then preceded to the famous language about penal and the distinction between penal and non-penal statutes, that the government cannot label something non-penal, when it is really penal.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.821" offset="999799">In our view, that is a secondary test, the threshold test is always whether there is a criminal process in link or nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.674" offset="1039192">If there is found such a connection then the question is whether the punishment is penal and if it found to be penal then the question is, is it cruel and unusual and, the court has certainly expanded the definition of the term cruel and unusual but we submit that it has never expanded the basic definition of punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.692" offset="1135322">So, unless there is punishment in the Eight Amendment sentence, the amendment does not apply and that brings me to the cases in the lower courts which have departed from this standard that I am suggesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.967" offset="1192374">The prison cases are the best example and the most famous prison case is that decision written by Mr. Justice Blackmun, while on the Court of Appeals, Jackson v. Bishop in which the flogging of prisoners in Arkansas Penitentiaries was prohibited as violated the Eight Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.666" offset="1287146">Other cases have applied it into juvenile institutions, the Nelson v. Heyne in the Seventh Circuit, dealt with a juvenile institution where there criminal and non-criminal youngsters in the institution but it gave no analysis to what we see to be the threshold issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="321.426" offset="1386202">Mr. Howard, can I interrupt?</text>
            <text syncTime="323.001" offset="1392472">I cannot remember whether yesterday, you answered Mr. Justice Blackmun’s question about two persons in the same institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.238" offset="1417445">One, there is resolved of conviction for crime and the other is finding of mental illness, and the same punishment being meted out to both, it was if your answer, that one would have Eighth Amendment Claim and the other would not?</text>

            <text syncTime="340.476" offset="1462376">Yes sir, I was really trying in a long way to get that answer now by explaining our theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.724" offset="1483378">My answer would be yes, that under rigorous analysis of this court’s decisions, the civilly committed mental patient would not have benefit of the Eight Amendment.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="356.967" offset="1528413">Would your analysis be the same if both of them, if the person inflicting the discipline, said in words, this is punishment and was doing what was in effect, punishing the man for a kind of both situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.473" offset="1582434">I think I would be the same Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.337" offset="1593824">Again, I see it as a question of contours of the Eighth Amendment and what I see to be a blurring of those contours by lower court treatment, so far which has not examined this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.348" offset="1653905">Most of the cases involving mixed institutional custody have not stated why the Eight Amendment is invoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.117" offset="1696955">They have assumed that it has been invoked.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="401.569" offset="1706777">I was wondering if one could reconcile the case as you described about the loss of citizenship, by simply saying that one case it was punishment and the other case, it was not, rather than saying in one case there was a criminal process and the other was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.484" offset="1758395">Wouldn’t the opinions be consistent with that rather simple approach, or is any language in the opinions, that would be inconsistent with that rather simple approach?</text>

          <turn speaker="frank_a_howard-_jr" startTime="423.561" stopTime="459.128">
            <label>Mr. Frank A. Howard</label>
            <text syncTime="423.561" offset="1794758">Well, I have am find it difficult to see the analogy, Mr. Justice Stevens because in the Perez and Trop cases, the end result was exactly the same and the only distinction that I can see between taking away -- restoring Mr. Trop’s citizenship when he was convicted of wartime desertion and taking away from Mr. Perez when he voted in a foreign election was the Chief Justice’s lead in the opinion by discussing punishment as a consequence of crime.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="459.128" offset="1936968">But couldn't one just simply say punishment, and forget it as a consequence of crime, wouldn’t the same distinction apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="464.281" offset="1957657">That is really my problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.312" offset="1977719">As in the loss of citizenship situation, it clearly was, I mean, in the consequence of wartime desertion, it was clearly punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.333" offset="2009798">It seemed to me, if that had been done by executive order or by some other procedure, other than it, results a crime, one could consistently with the opinion still call it punishment covered by Eight Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.040" offset="2052638">I am not quite sure why one could not do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1173.288" offset="4793615">Goss v. Lopez is the starting point, we believe here, and the Goss case as we see it was predicated upon the deprivation of the right to education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.088" offset="4840844">That suspensions at least took the child out of school, away from the education which the state had guarantied to give them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.089" offset="4880864">Corporal punishment in contrast is correction while keeping the child in school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.036" offset="4900612">The purpose of Corporal Punishment as a disciplinary alternative, is to correct the child quickly while putting him back to class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.935" offset="4936243">The record here at least shows there was no retardation of progress of any of the children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.735" offset="4963411">The numerous citations are collected in brief to the record, the students progressed fairly, and normally on through school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.886" offset="5000087">They suffered no reputational harm and there is no showing that future schooling or future employment was jeopardized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.557" offset="5038748">So, in so far as the, in the first inquiry whether there is a protected interest, the state of Florida guarantees children the right to an education but it does not guarantee them the right to go public school with immunity from corporal punishment in case of misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.003" offset="5128504">The petitioners have sought to find a secured right in the Fourth Amendment for which there is no case support at all and it was never argued below, Fourth Circuit did not even deal with this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.170" offset="5181167">Mr. Rogow suggested the number theory and I do not know how far that goes or what it covers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.937" offset="5212305">Further, I think and his most strongest reliance is on some generalized liberty interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.556" offset="5246682">We say first that there is no deprivation of liberty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.767" offset="5271551">The constitution says that liberty shall not be deprived or taken away and Corporal Punishment in the normal situation, and that is what we are talking about, is a temporary detention only for correctional purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.148" offset="5333096">The student’s liberty interest is just one ingredient and a balance of interest which is then reached by the states, by almost all of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.000" offset="5372488">State policy and history, in this country, favor local educators, discretion and control in these sorts of decisions and provide remedies when that discretion is abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.738" offset="5427450">So, we submit that there is no fall for a federal mold which is going to be frightening to administrators, probably self-defeating in terms of the use of this remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.454" offset="5486278">Because educators do not look upon rules of the Supreme Court even if they are called informal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.481" offset="5510415">They do not look upon them as informal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.713" offset="5523371">They are mindful of Wood v. Strickland, the personal liability problem, and my time is up and I thank you for it.</text>
