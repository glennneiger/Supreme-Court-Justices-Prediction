            <text syncTime="53.006" offset="312570">There are three issues in this case; the first issue is whether or not the Eighth Amendment is cruel on unusual punishment clause, has any application to public school students who are beaten by their teachers or principals.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.251" offset="369517">The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held an affect that no matter how brutal how severe, how excessive the beating is inflicted upon public schools students, they may seek no relief under the Eighth Amendment that is the first issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.630" offset="423016">The second issue is if the Eighth Amendment does apply as we submit it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.674" offset="443182">Whether or not the facts of this case show that these student’s Eighth Amendment’s right have been violated, The third issue which is separate and distinct, is whether or not any corporal punishment inflicted by an instrument designed to cause bodily injury, whether or not that punishment must be proceeded by some opportunity to be heard under the 14th Amendment’s Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.160" offset="545164">The Court of Appeal’s decision was that there was no need for such a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="120.508" offset="582571">In fact I turned out to the Eighth Amendment argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.437" offset="602216">The effect of the Court of Appeals decision as I mentioned is to give carte blanche to teachers and principals to punish corporally as severely as excessively as they may do and there will be no recourse under the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.160" offset="661148">The decision seems to focus on the issue of whether or not the punishment is imposed in a criminal setting or a civil setting and the Court of Appeals held that the Eighth Amendment only applies in the criminal context.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.691" offset="711303">We believe that decision misses the point of the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.507" offset="726558">The focus of the Eighth Amendment is upon punishment, it is not upon who delivers the punishment.</text>

            <text syncTime="183.527" offset="834601">Exactly punishment imposed under color of State Law which are the facts of this case and which is the kind of punishment we are talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.738" offset="867411">The original purpose of the Eighth Amendment was to preclude the barbaric kinds of punishments which were known in the 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th centuries in England and on the continent.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.638" offset="911087">To be sure the drafters look back, looked at history and saw terrible punishments imposed in a criminal context generally and that is what they sought to ban in the Eighth Amendment because that is what they saw in the past, but that does not mean that there was to be no ban on punishments imposed by other people acting under color of State Law if those punishments were excessive and severe.</text>

            <text syncTime="866.396" offset="3566069">First of all it was the product of a voluntary school or educational system, were parents could choose to send their children, or not send their children to school.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.526" offset="3598565">That is not the situation today, children must be sent to school and to some extent that ties in with the custody notion that is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.215" offset="3637331">Secondly, if parents have some way at least to say I withdraw my this assumed delegation to a teacher then perhaps one could say well there may not need to be a hearing before the punishment is imposed because the parent has already given their authority to do it, but there cannot be that withdrawal the way the law stands today.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.669" offset="3731162">So, a parent is committed to sending his children to school, he has no say or she has no say, about what kind of punishment is inflicted in that school and we submit at the local parent’s argument does not permit because there has been assumed delegation excessive beatings and it doesn’t permit of beating without an opportunity for a hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1241.373" offset="5066020">We see the case as an opportunity, first for the court to clarify and reaffirm the scope of the Eighth Amendment as been limited to punishments inflicted either as a consequence of or collateral to the criminal process and secondly if not to overrule, Goss versus Lopez at least to confine it within it’s rationale and not to open that rule to threaten the discretion of educators and still more and more and more day to day decisions which are been made throughout the nation in the schools.</text>
