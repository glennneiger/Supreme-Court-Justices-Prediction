            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100559">We will hear arguments next in Marks against the United States, 75-708.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Eugene Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="36.974" offset="248412">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.095" offset="260846">This is a case that arose out of the Eastern District of Kentucky and charged charges involved the obscenity law, conspiracy to violate the Federal Obscenity Laws 1462 and 65.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.045" offset="320719">The conduct occurred beginning, I think, a period back in 1970 and continued theoretically up through February of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.995" offset="360530">This Court, in June of 1973, enunciated and changed, we suggest, what was the prevailing law in practice, and that is to say, the standards for determining obscenity a la Roth Memoirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.812" offset="419775">And the counsel herein has filed in its Petition and its brief the argument that certainly just is ex post facto judicial lawmaking, the change that occurred, and that a court should not have used the Miller test for conduct which occurred prior to the Miller test.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.895" offset="504099">It had been, we suggest, the law in practice and generally understood, although this Court had not so articulated it, that there were three elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.075" offset="536804">This is what Mr. Justice Brennan in essence set forth in his Memoirs decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.505" offset="562508">In fact, even at one point when Justice Rehnquist, who was appearing before a House Committee to testify regarding the views on some obscenity laws, discussed the fact that there seemed to be the obscenity law today had three elements to it, although he did say that the last part of the test -- that is to say, the ”utterly without social value” test -- had only been joined in by Justices Brennan, Fortis and Chief Justice Warren.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.061" offset="672745">But he suggests that until this Court said something else that it was going to be followed by the lower appellate courts and the lower federal courts of the country, and in fact that wasn’t what occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.932" offset="728229">I think in the Solicitor General’s brief and response and the seeming suggestion of confession of error, he indicates that all of the appellate courts that had occasion to consider this decision did so in light of the Roth Memoirs test and thus it sort of had become the law in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.667" offset="811194">The Sixth Circuit, without viewing the films in question, found that the particular material obscene, they said, under either test.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.550" offset="846721">And of course, that was a matter to which Judge McCrate dissented.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.994" offset="864484">And so we start with the proposition that the Roth Memoirs test was the law in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.992" offset="888517">It was assumed to be the law in practice -- by defendants, by courts, the lower appellate courts, state courts, federal courts all across the country, even though this Court had not so articulated it -- and that there came a time when this Court did articulate new standards, and that was, of course, in June of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.337" offset="965839">So all of the conduct for which Misters Marks and Monet and the associate members of their group were charged occurred prior to this Court’s enunciation of the new test.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.138" offset="1009098">And we say that based on the law, the Bouie versus City of Columbia and the other cases that have been cited in our briefs, that obviously this is an expansion, this is a judicial gloss, this is a change, this is a detriment that has occurred to the defendants and, thus, they should not be held accountable and chargeable under that more severe test, certainly severe as to the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.675" offset="1095197">And we say that in this context, the Court erred in not allowing us to have the case tried under the Roth Memoirs standard and, thus, erred in not allowing us to have expert witnesses or other testimony which would have elucidated evidence in light of the Roth Memoirs standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="274.747" offset="1199478">The statute has remained the same, it has not changed; however, as you had occasioned, sir, when you testified before the House Committee, I think and on Page 430 of the report of the hearings for Subcommittee No. 3, I think Your Honor opted for the fact it was better to have a general definition of obscenity than to have a more restrictive definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.140" offset="1297072">I think you said, “Mr. Chairman, I think we have the same reservations as Mr. Holly expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.140" offset="1317029">The extremely detailed definition of sexual conduct, sexual excitement and sadomasochistic abuse seems less desirable than the more general phraseology found in the Administration Bill.”</text>

            <text syncTime="346.182" offset="1485258">Well, we think, Your Honor, we take in essence by adding up figures, we think we can come up to seven Justices, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.460" offset="1518381">First, we have Mr. Justice Brennan and joined by Chief Justice Warren and Fortis, who made two significant modifications in the previous Roth standard and that this, in essence, became a law in practice from 1966 to 1973, because Justice Black, Douglas and Justice Stewart agreed and could be counted upon to reach the same result, but for different reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.520" offset="1662577">No, sir. But when we took Justices Douglas and Black, who say that there are no laws, Justice Stewart who says only hard-core and Justice Harlan who says in federal cases only hard-core is applicable, then I think we are dealing with a majority, a clear majority.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.436" offset="1726211">Well, I say if you added that group, I think that at the time of the decision in Memoirs, we are talking about … adding the figures up, we are talking about approximately seven Justices.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="421.616" offset="1786920">But you're not suggesting that it subsisted for any given number of years after that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Eugene Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="426.663" offset="1807191">It has not changed; it has become the law in practice, as enunciated by every Federal appellate court in the country and almost every state appellate court in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.241" offset="1837493">Roth Memoirs was thought to be the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.499" offset="1846479">And as I said, Your Honor, even with the Department of Justice -- and I agree that it's not binding and any Solicitor General’s brief on the matter is not binding -- certainly, it appeared to be the law of the land upon which Defendants would rely in governing their conduct so as not to offend the Federal criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.727" offset="1915442">And we say that what occurred certainly was in connection with the Court’s enunciation of the standards in Miller, the Court suggests that this is the first time since Roth the Court majority has been able to agree upon the formulation of standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.992" offset="1976464">Mr. Justice Burger refers to the fact that the Roth Memoirs test was, at least for the State of California, correctly regarded as the appropriate test at the time the conduct was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.293" offset="2017633">And so we again say that Defendants have the right to rely on that particular factor; and because of the change in law in Miller, which occurred after the conduct involved here, we certainly think that our clients certainly in the procedure of due process are entitled to this aspect of constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.121" offset="2108957">Our second argument primarily directs itself to the failure of the appellate court to review the movies in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.933" offset="2140200">In this instance, two of the judges looked at the affidavits in support of the search warrants and made their conclusion that this was hard-core pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.576" offset="2190773">Unfortunately, hard-core pornography is not a talisman that says that anything that is hard-core pornography is, in and of itself, obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.602" offset="2222956">Else-wise, it would not have been necessary for this Court, through Justice Burger’s decision, to enunciate three definitive aspects of what is to be used to define material that can be condemned as obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.548" offset="2274678">So the appellate court refused to look at the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.601" offset="2290874">We feel that they should have looked at the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.721" offset="2299442">It is the responsibility, it's a mixed question of law and fact, and we suggest that they erred in avoiding their duty to look at the film and that they should be required to do so.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="561.165" offset="2345209">Now, when you say ”should,” are you telling us this is constitutionally required?</text>

            <text syncTime="567.940" offset="2372272">We suggest, Your Honor, given the fact that it is a mixed question of law and fact as enunciated by this Court, we do feel that they had the responsibility to look at the material and determine not just the normal question of whether the material is like a finding of fact that would not otherwise be reviewed, a jury finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.517" offset="2454610">I think Justice Clark took that position in earlier cases, particularly, in the Memoirs case; but it was never joined in by other members of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1013.962" offset="4156330">And that’s why I would have preferred certainly had the judge given the charge of the contemporary community standards without defining a geographical limit so that we could have argued to the jury about what is the community, what is the definition of the community and made it, we suggest, more meaningful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.467" offset="4218397">But when the judge says that you must consider the standards of the Eastern District of Kentucky and that’s the entire District, not just from where the jury is drawn, and you consider that most of Eastern District is Appalachia, we are not dealing with anything that is meaningful in terms of these defendants in this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1073.374" offset="4394045">And so we felt that it was extremely important that the jury be allowed to consider that of which they knew, whatever they knew about that community standard, to be incorporated in part of the whole in this particular regard.</text>
