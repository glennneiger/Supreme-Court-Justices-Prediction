            <label>Mr. Wayne L. Kidwell</label>
            <text syncTime="17.142" offset="169085">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, Attorney General Gorton, Attorney General Johnson, gentlemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.745" offset="203462">We are asking this Court to grant our motion for leave to file our complaint under the provision of the Constitution granting original jurisdiction, because we are facing what we consider in the Northwest a problem of monumental importance, of nationwide importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.404" offset="290084">We’re talking about the anadromous fish runs, the anadromous fish, a migratory fish that is born in freshwater, eventually makes its way to the sea, living from one to four years in the sea, and then, if possible, returns to the place of its birth to spawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.287" offset="369601">The problem is the 900 miles that these fish may travel has (sic) many hazards.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.297" offset="401680">We recognize there are other hazards than we’re going to address ourselves hereto today.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.830" offset="419756">Obviously, we have dams; there are eight of them over the part of the Columbia River Basin that we’re talking about today.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.456" offset="450267">They certainly take their toll.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.924" offset="456223">The nitrogen super-saturation, the slack water, the pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.972" offset="476390">There are some factors:  heavy sports fishing and commercial fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.123" offset="500945">The problem is that the anadromous fish, after they leave the ocean, go through two states; but over half of them spawn in the State of Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.197" offset="549324">And the anadromous fish are governed by a Compact that was passed by the States of Oregon and Washington in 1915, ratified by the United States Congress in 1918, of which only the two States are members.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.166" offset="605121">Idaho has not had a voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.204" offset="613271">It’s not because the State of Idaho has not attempted to have a voice.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.465" offset="634378">As far back as 1937, the United States Fisheries Commission recommended then that Idaho be made a member of the Columbia River Fish Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.251" offset="681503">Negotiations were started.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.490" offset="686414">They continued for many, many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.660" offset="695087">As recently as 1968, the governors of the three States convened a meeting to discuss the anadromous fish in the Pacific Northwest, and the governors of these three States did recommend that Idaho become a member; however, nearly 40 years now have elapsed since the Compact was first entered into, and Idaho is still not a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.157" offset="789128">The problem is, if Idaho were a member, we feel that the problem would not be as acute and critical as it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.269" offset="817549">If we are allowed to file our complaint, we can show by competent evidence that in many instances, the fish runs themselves have been depleted by as much as 80%.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.565" offset="862793">This anadromous fish cycle is a unique ...</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="193.017" offset="872511">Is there some reason why membership has not been achieved?</text>

          <turn speaker="wayne_l_kidwell" startTime="198.294" stopTime="212.530">
            <label>Mr. Wayne L. Kidwell</label>
            <text syncTime="198.294" offset="893618">Your Honor, I guess I would have to blame politics.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.919" offset="908142">Many of the leaders of the States have expressed their desire and willingness to have Idaho made a member, but the State Legislatures have never gotten around to admitting the State of Idaho.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="212.530" stopTime="216.807">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="212.530" offset="950564">Mr. Attorney General, if you are admitted, is that the end of your problem?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wayne_l_kidwell" startTime="216.807" stopTime="248.415">
            <label>Mr. Wayne L. Kidwell</label>
            <text syncTime="216.807" offset="967701">No, sir, it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.733" offset="975433">If we are admitted to the Columbia River Fish Compact, that’s only Step 1.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.156" offset="997062">There would be three States then, if we were given an equal voice, the problem would arise that Idaho would have interests that are somewhat different than Oregon and Washington, and there is certainly the danger of our being outvoted two to one and we would maintain the status quo, and nothing would change.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.992" offset="1064458">So we are asking this Court to grant us admission to the Columbia River Fish Compact.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.758" offset="1091521">Now, I recognize --</text>

            <text syncTime="248.415" offset="1094133">By what authority do you have, General Kidwell, for this Court's power to grant you what you want?</text>

            <text syncTime="253.570" offset="1114718">Justice Rehnquist, I was going to point out that I recognize that there has been no case, at least that we have been able to find, whereby this Court could say directly that we would be entitled to become a member; however, there is considerable authority, Your Honor, that this Court is the final say-so on the politity and operation and fairness of interstate compacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.053" offset="1208654">So we would urge either that this Court take the unprecedented step of saying that Idaho should be a member, or achieve the same result by saying that those portions of the Compact that deny Idaho its fair share, its apportionment, of the anadromous fish be declared invalid so far as the operation of the Compact is concerned.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="300.043" offset="1300710">What authority do you rely on for this Court’s power to review what you call the fairness of a Compact that has been entered into by the two States and ratified by Congress?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wayne_l_kidwell" startTime="311.942" stopTime="338.117">
            <label>Mr. Wayne L. Kidwell</label>
            <text syncTime="311.942" offset="1348253">Your Honor, probably the most clear expression by this Court would be a fairly recent case, Nebraska versus Iowa at 406 U.S, Your Honor, where the Court then was not reviewing a fish compact, but it was a compact between two States concerning itself with the river boundaries between the two States.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="343.346" offset="1473849">Well, you're asserting right now no more right than you would assert if there had been no Compact at all, namely, if you suggest that this Court apportion the anadromous fish in the river among the States just as though we were operating on a stream.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="wayne_l_kidwell" startTime="366.788" stopTime="368.443">
            <label>Mr. Wayne L. Kidwell</label>
            <text syncTime="366.788" offset="1567681">That’s essentially correct, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.443" offset="1574264">And that if you're right, if you’re entitled to a portion of those fish runs, if Idaho is, then the agreement between two other States isn’t about to deprive you of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.392" offset="1634032">That's your position, I take it.</text>

            <text syncTime="386.152" offset="1645108">The problem is that the fish, when they are attempting to return to Idaho to spawn, are taken from the Columbia River through many other factors; but commercial fishing is one way that we feel if Idaho were in that we could attempt to cut back.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.145" offset="1705085">What we are asking for is, one, to become a member of the Compact and, secondly, for this Court to apply, for want of a better word, I’ll call it equitable apportionment, recognizing that this Court has applied that in water cases and applying it to this --</text>

            <text syncTime="1667.876" offset="6772004">Well, isn't it true that sometimes when people ask for five or seven paragraphs of relief, a Court grants one or two?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee Johnson</label>
            <text syncTime="1676.083" offset="6804814">Well, my point is, Mr. Chief Justice, is, that it is not what the State of Idaho is asking; indeed, that is the last thing that the State of Idaho wants, and I think maybe I can explain this by simply first maybe describing the regulatory scheme that exists in Oregon and Washington and pointing out to what Idaho wants, it doesn’t want to strike down that regulatory scheme; they just don’t like the way we are doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.504" offset="6910453">That regulatory scheme provides -- and both States have similar statutes -- provides for a regulatory commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.528" offset="6942636">The commission sets the time of fishing, sets the manner of fishing and sets the place of fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.672" offset="6967191">The commission -- and this is strictly in the area of commercial fishing that we are talking about today, according to Idaho’s complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.206" offset="7001360">Now, the commission, one, there is an established area for commercial fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.432" offset="7022258">It is from the mouth of the Columbia River up to approximately 140 miles, just short of Bonneville Dam, which is the first major dam on the Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.057" offset="7064680">The fishing days or the season is open on the basis of an escapement level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.912" offset="7092161">That is the rationale or the terminology as it is used in this regulatory scheme, and the escapement level basically is to get enough fish over this commercial fishing area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.831" offset="7143779">And understand there is a second commercial fishery above Bonneville, which is the Indian commercial fishery, regulated by the treaties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.550" offset="7174708">There is, of course, a game fishery that goes all the way through Oregon and Washington and on into Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.884" offset="7199995">The escapement level is premised to try to use the existing spawning beds, to fully utilize those existing spawning beds that exist throughout the Columbia and its tributaries, both Oregon, Washington and Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.086" offset="7260808">There is a limitation on those spawning beds because of the industrialization that has occurred; but it is to utilize those beds to preserve the run, and once that escapement -- and it is estimated by taking the number of fish that are in, and also they have to allow for how many fish are going to be taken by the Indians and how many are going to be taken by game fishermen in all three States -- and still get the proper spawning level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.134" offset="7364984">Once that escapement is accomplished, then we open that fishing up for commercial fishing and the season is open, and until that escapement is accomplished the season is closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.758" offset="7411482">What Idaho is contending -- and this is one of the things, one of their analogies or one of their arguments, they rely on a case, Pennsylvanian versus West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.211" offset="7453382">But the whole problem that Idaho has in this case is that the only effect of the State of Oregon and the State of Washington's regulation has got to be positive as far as the State of Idaho is concerned, because every day that that fishing is closed means that fish do get to Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.135" offset="7520987">If the States had chosen not to regulate it or if this Court should declare that statute, for example, as a undo interference with interstate commerce, Idaho would be left terribly out in the cold, as well as would our States, because what would happen would be the destruction of the fishery.</text>
