            <text syncTime="22.460" offset="190294">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.201" offset="205340">There are three sets of petitioners in this case, held jointly and severally liable on different combinations of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.298" offset="241703">I shall argue for Bangor Punta; Judge Peck shall argue for First Boston; and Mr. Pennoyer will argue for the Piper family defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.250" offset="281513">This case involves a bid by Chris-Craft to take over the Piper Aircraft Company in January of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.656" offset="319130">The bid was resisted by management, including members of the Piper family.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.932" offset="344207">In April of 1969, Piper’s financial advisor, First Boston, invited Bangor Punta to submit a competing bid. Bangor did so and won in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.446" offset="390287">Chris-Craft went to court and won a $36 million judgment, the largest ever rendered in a private action under the securities laws and far more than any conceivable difference between the value of the 42% of Piper that Chris-Craft still owns and the 51% that it sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.789" offset="479626">If you will pick up, Your Honors, the blue-covered Bangor brief and look at Page 9 -- that's our main brief -- you will find that a table summarizing the control contest, of which the clerk has extra copies.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.010" offset="540544">Two technical violations of the securities laws were found against Bangor Punta.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.856" offset="563949">The first related to Item 5 on that table.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.457" offset="578264">When after announcing its intention to make an exchange offer for Piper shares Bangor bought three blocks from institutions in off-exchange transactions, in a first-impression ruling on the application of FCC Rule 10(b)-6, these purchases of Piper shares were held to have violated the rule, even though they were found below to have been made without any manipulative intent or effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.339" offset="693830">The second violation was found in connection with Item 7 on that table.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.878" offset="712011">Bangor’s exchange prospectus did not mention an offer it had received to buy one of its assets, the Bangor &amp; Aroostock Railroad, at a price in cash well below its carrying value on Bangor’s books.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.805" offset="767704">In an SEC injunctive suit that was tried together with the Chris-Craft private suit, the District Court found that this submission was made in good faith and without intent to mislead.</text>

            <text syncTime="215.422" offset="962160">We argued below and we still believe that they were not violations, but we did not think either issue as to violation was of sufficient importance to raise on certiorari on those particular --</text>

            <text syncTime="238.302" offset="1053693">It is our position that the violations caused no injury to Chris-Craft, the plaintiff in this action, or indeed to anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.107" offset="1084935">The court below, the trial court, expressly rejected charges that Bangor had already accepted that offer to buy the railroad or that it had even decided to accept the offer, and they also rejected charges that a loss should have been recorded in Bangor’s financial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.517" offset="1166542">But the court found that the failure to mention the offer was material, because the offer made the carrying value obsolete, as the trial court said, absolute disclosure, and it ordered Bangor to provide the exchanging Piper shareholders an opportunity to rescind, which none of them accepted.</text>

            <text syncTime="291.082" offset="1264762">That carrying value was obsolete was the trial court’s word without some mention of the fact that the offer had been received.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.686" offset="1299244">It did not say that the carrying value should be changed, but that some mention should have been made of the fact that the offer had been received.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler</label>
            <text syncTime="315.615" offset="1362983">As I said, the court ordered Bangor to provide an opportunity to rescind to the accepting Piper shareholders, which none of them accepted because the market value of the Bangor exchange package continued at all times to be higher than the value of the Piper shares that had been offered in exchange.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="336.361" offset="1445948">Mr. Cutrer, when was that offer to rescind made?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lloyd_n_cutler" startTime="338.676" stopTime="526.156">
            <label>Mr. Lloyd N. Cutler</label>
            <text syncTime="338.676" offset="1455143">That offer was made in, I believe, March of 1976, Justice Stevens, the delay from the time that cert was denied in this Court on the original order having occurred primarily because the four Chris-Craft directors of Piper representing their 42% were anxious, since Piper had to issue a prospectus or a registration relating to this exchange offer, that independent counsel be retained for that purpose and that updated financials be provided, and that delay was entirely satisfactory to the SEC, the enforcing arm.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.762" offset="1631521">But it made no real difference, because at all times, as I said, throughout, the value of the Bangor package was higher, and no one rescinded.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.809" offset="1667675">The Court of Appeals affirmed all of these particular findings and orders relating to the SEC case, and in that action the SEC obtained all of the relief that was appropriate for the exchanging Piper shareholders, none of whom have brought any private damage action of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.141" offset="1757014">Now, Chris-Craft’s private action has been before the Second Circuit three times, and each time the Second Circuit reversed the District Court on the critical points of law that are now here for review.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.441" offset="1810199">In so doing, the court created an implied damage action for a non-purchaser under Rule 10(b)-6, in conflict we say with this Court’s ruling in Blue Chip.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.393" offset="1854085">It created an implied action for a competing offeror under 14(e), in conflict we say with the principles of this Court’s later opinion in Cort against Ash.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.129" offset="1901001">It held scienter was required, but defined it to equal mere awareness of the undisclosed fact about those railroad negotiations, which we say is in conflict with this Court’s later opinion in Hochfelder, and it found causation on the basis of presumptions, despite findings in the trial court that causal effect had not been proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.504" offset="1994519">It computed damages itself under a theory that wrongly insured Chris-Craft against the later and unrelated decline in the value of the Piper shares, and that confused the value of control with a mere opportunity to compete for control.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.673" offset="2063169">Now, Mr. Liman is doubtless going to tell you a more colorful tale, in which he'll portray Chris-Craft as a victim of the greatest securities fraud since the Mississippi Bubble; but Chris-Craft’s tale utterly failed to convince the District Court, which as I have said found that Bangor’s technical violations were made in good faith and without intent to deceive.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.072" offset="2160762">We assume that this Court did not grant certiorari to retry these findings of the experienced trial-judge findings, which the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="535.012" offset="2240488">There was an earlier Chris-Craft suit for a preliminary injunction tried by Judge Tenney.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.725" offset="2275388">I want to turn first to whether Congress intended to create these private damage actions that Chris-Craft is now pursuing.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.217" offset="2309347">As to Rule 10(b)-6, it seems that to us that Blue Chip just settles the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.514" offset="2330558">Christ-Craft did not purchase any of the Bangor securities that were offered in distribution, and the violation was not committed in connection with, those words of 10(b), any of the Piper stock that was purchased by Chris-Craft.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.204" offset="2397327">As to 14(e), whether any private damage action was created under 14(e) should be implied, or any other section of the Williams Act, has not been squarely passed on by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.940" offset="2452289">Under Cort against Ash in Wyandot, courts have implied damage remedies only when the plaintiff is within the class for whose special benefit, as the Court says, Congress acted and only when the harm alleged to him is the type of harm that Congress wanted to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.784" offset="2527626">On Rondeau, this Court held that target-company shareholders are the class that Congress wanted to protect in the Williams Act, and it indicated that the harm to them from a violation is the only type of harm that Congress wanted to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.769" offset="2599515">I think our briefs make clear there is absolutely nothing in the language or the legislative intent of the Williams Act that shows Congress intended in 14(e) to confer rights on anyone other than the target-company shareholders or to prevent any harm suffered by a competing offeror, but not suffered by the target shareholders as a class.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.129" offset="2709020">As our briefs show, Congress gave no clue that it wanted to, and neither did the SEC draft through the Williams Act or anyone who testified in its favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.395" offset="2750085">Now, Chris-Craft, while it holds Piper stock, is very plainly not suing in that capacity any more than a displaced officer or director of a target company would be suing in his capacity as a shareholder if he was suing to recover the fees and the salaries he lost because the new people in control kicked him out.</text>

            <text syncTime="729.649" offset="3019041">We do not challenge, that and as I'll show in the moment, when Congress has legislated both expressed private injunctive and private damage remedies, it has frequently granted a wider class the right to sue for an injunction than the class that is allowed to sue for damages to itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.278" offset="3097618">Now, what Chris-Craft is asking for here is the damages for the loss of this opportunity to compete for control, something no other target shareholder can have.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.833" offset="3151848">It's more than any other target shareholder could collect; and moreover, they're trying to collect it at the ultimate expense of the very target shareholders, the innocent shareholders who accepted the Bangor’s securities in the exchange offer and now hold Bangor stock, and that ironic result is going to occur in every case of competing exchange offers if the loser is allowed to recover damages against the winner.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.817" offset="3275773">And what we put to you is, is it reasonable to believe that target shareholders, who are the supposed victims of the violation, but who are not complaining themselves, ought to be turned into defendants instead of plaintiffs and are to be injured by the judgment that's supposed to protect them?</text>
            <text syncTime="812.472" offset="3350379">Yet, the Court of Appeals here said that evidence of legislative attempt was unnecessary and that under common-law tort principles, Chris-Craft should have a Federal damage remedy, simply because it claimed injury from a violation of the Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.285" offset="3413595">But there is supposed to be no Federal common law, and there is no universal statutory principle of a Federal damage remedy, for everyone claiming violation or injury from a violation of the Federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.765" offset="3467512">And when Your Honors look at the private remedies that Congress has expressly created in the securities laws and many other laws, you'll find that they've weighed a variety of competing policy considerations and come out with a variety of answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.770" offset="3523518">Sometimes, as if the Food and Drug Act, Federal Trade Commission Act, courts have held that Congress created no private remedies at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.829" offset="3555806">Sometimes, as Water Pollution and the Toxic Substances Act that's now before the President, Congress has created a private injunctive remedy, but not a damage remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.794" offset="3599691">And as in the Clayton Act and in the opinion in Hawaii, Justice Marshal, where Congress created both types of remedies, the court held that Congress gave a broader class the right to sue for the injunction than the class it gave the right to sue for damages; and that's why, Justice Stewart, the cases that do allow persons outside the protected class to seek injunctions in order to protect the class don't establish that Congress meant to give those same people the right to sue for damages to themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.394" offset="3738036">Now, in the securities laws themselves, Congress has always created damage remedies on what the opinion in Hochfelder called a "particularized basis" for a limited type of harm and a limited degree of culpability and for a limited class of plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.683" offset="3831241">That's the principle that Blue Chip and Hochfelder follow and the opinion below does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.455" offset="3862274">Let me come now to scienter.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.172" offset="3873141">In Hochfelder, the court ruled that scienter is required in a private damage action under 10(b) and also the SEC rule issued under 10(b), and it defines scienter as "a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate and defraud".</text>

            <text syncTime="979.195" offset="4017233">This decision was issued before Hochfelder, and it held that no such intent was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.087" offset="4044818">As for the 10(b)-6 violation, it seems to us Hochfelder very plainly controls, and the District Court’s findings of no manipulative intent or effect, affirmed on appeal, conclude the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.254" offset="4097481">The Court of Appeals here recognized that scienter was required, because 14(e) had been modeled on 10(b)-5; but after it affirmed the trial court’s finding that the omission concerning the railroad negotiations had been made in good faith and without intent to mislead, the Second Circuit found scienter in Bangor’s and First Boston’s mere awareness of the negotiations, a standard totally incompatible, we say, with the intent to deceive that was required by Hochfelder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1031.675" offset="4227153">In Hochfelder, Justice Stewart, as you noted, the Court left open the question whether recklessness could ever meet the same requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.939" offset="4260276">But that, as Judge Friendly had said earlier, was the kind of recklessness that's equivalent to willful fraud, and no such recklessness in that sense could possibly have been involved here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1219.388" offset="4978016">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.019" offset="4992540">The threshold question in this case as far as First Boston is concerned is what duty it owed to whom in its capacity as underwriter of Bangor Punta’s registration statement and exchange offer, and specifically did it owe any duty to Chris-Craft as a competing offeror.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.895" offset="5096090">The answer is found in Section 11 of the Securities Act, defining the responsibility of an underwriter on a registration statement, which is a duty of due diligence created by Section 11 and owed only to persons acquiring the securities offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.762" offset="5203505">Now, Chris-Craft was not a member of that class, and there's no suggestion that it had any standing under Section 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.618" offset="5238927">The claim is, but not withstanding the express provisions and limitations of Section 11, First Boston had an implied responsibility under Section 14(e) of the Securities Exchange Act, an Act that makes no reference to underwriters and unlimited as to the persons to whom it might be liable and as to the amount that might be recovered, because the registration statement was made in connection with a tender offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.670" offset="5431188">That fact, that connection, makes all the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.792" offset="5451668">Now, the untenability of such a claim, we submit, is apparent, both from its conflict with the express language of Section 11 and in necessary recognition of the fact that Section 11 is the source and the only source of an underwriter’s responsibility on a registration statement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1497.899" offset="6092086">Well, First Boston came in in its first connection after the Pipers rejected … well, the Pipers in the first place asked Bangor Punta to appraise the value of the Chris-Craft offer in the first place, which they did and which they said had a value of $65 a share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.493" offset="6230431">The next thing was after the Pipers decided that they didn't want Chris-Craft as a partner, they asked First Boston to participate in finding another offeror, which it did; then Bangor Punta came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.673" offset="6315172">Now, there is nothing in Section 14(e) to imply this cause of action that's been asserted here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.053" offset="6344743">There is nothing in the legislative history to suggest any such Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.835" offset="6371806">Indeed, the whole of the legislative history is perfectly clear that the intent was to protect only investors, the class to whom an offer is addressed, the only persons who can act upon the offer and the only persons who can be mislead if there's anything misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.017" offset="6448501">There is nothing to meet any of the tests that this Court has enumerated in the past for implied causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.663" offset="6483087">Indeed, the very idea of causes of action to a person outside a protected class upon a showing that the class was misled certainly does not give rise to the implication of a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.342" offset="6561873">Now, the anomaly is illustrated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.427" offset="6574202">Not one of the persons who accepted the Bangor offer has ever complained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.635" offset="6607012">Not one accepted the offer of rescission by direction of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.609" offset="6634911">And the anomaly is further illustrated by what the Court of Appeals did here about causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.462" offset="6670333">Chris-Craft deduced no evidence that the so-called admission of the BAR -- in that, I refer to BAR as the railroad and the sale of the railroad -- that the omission of that from the Bangor Punta registration statement accounted either for Bangor Punta’s success in the contest or for Chris-Craft’s loss of the contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.198" offset="6805229">And the District Courts therefore held, and I'm going to quote, that "Chris-Craft had failed to establish an essential element of an action for damages, to wit, a causal relation between the deficiency in the Bangor Punta prospectus and the harm complained of".</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.773" offset="6887567">The Court of Appeals, however, faced with the inability to establish causation, solved the problem very simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.638" offset="6922989">It said that proof of causation, injury and damage was unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.469" offset="6950366">All were to be presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.818" offset="6963740">Now, the presumption that the court had to indulge in to reach its decision is not only impermissible as a matter of law and demonstrative of the lack of proof of causation in this case, but I submit also demonstrative of why such a cause of action as Chris-Craft is asserting here does not exist under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.200" offset="7069275">Common and statutory law down the years, even in this era of consumer litigation, have been both practical and sensible in not spawning endless litigation between competitors on charges that misleading advertising of one has taken away customers from the other, and Congress certainly didn't intend to launch such litigation by 14(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.646" offset="7191110">Now, the Court of Appeals must have understood all this, for it offered a special theory of imposing a non-existing liability upon Bangor Punta and First Boston alike.</text>

            <text syncTime="1839.624" offset="7459022">And then it made its great error conclusive in the light of this Court’s language in Hochfelder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.681" offset="7507192">It said that an intent to deceive is not an essential element of the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.559" offset="7546689">In other words, even though you're in a fraud case, you don't need intent to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.089" offset="7576886">Anything more than mere negligence as it labeled First Boston’s conduct here would be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.667" offset="7619205">I'm going to come, therefore, to scienter as the way the Court of Appeals worked it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.686" offset="7651179">It said that Bangor Punta was required to apprise the Piper shareholders of the negotiation over the BAR and of the consequent indication that it wasn't worth what it was carried at on the books; and that First Boston had enough information to reasonably deduce that the registration statement was inaccurate in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.918" offset="7784194">The particulars given, however, were entirely in the terms of First Boston’s investigation, which it said wasn't sufficient; that it should have undertaken a further investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.148" offset="7849082">Now, there's no suggestion in the opinion as to what any further investigation of the First Boston would have disclosed or that it would have disclosed anything other than what First Boston, the District Court and the Court of Appeals alike found, that there had been no decision to sell the railroad at the time the registration statement was out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.701" offset="7975306">Indeed, the District Court rejected as having no substance Chris-Craft’s basic claim that at the time of Bangor Punta’s exchange offer, it had intended to sell the BAR and delayed the sale to avoid disclosure, and said that it could not even find that there was any probability, reasonable probability of a sale at that time; that there was no purpose for omission of it from the prospectus; and that First Boston acted solely in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.776" offset="8103619">Now, the Court of Appeals upheld those findings and agreed that the failure to disclose the sale negotiations was not in bad faith and then adding, however, these faithful words, "that intent to defraud is not an indispensable element in the private action for damages under the anti-fraud provisions of the Federal Securities Law".</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.916" offset="8224201">That is the key sentence and the critical one as far as scienter is concerned in this case, and by this Court’s definition of it in Hochfelder, the Court of Appeals was clearly in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.437" offset="8294209">Of course, it didn't have the benefit of this Court’s decision at that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2135.721" offset="8643414">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.177" offset="8657206">Speaking in behalf of the Piper individuals at a slow gallop for five minutes, I'd like to discuss the issues of causation damages and the issue of scienter and touch briefly on the issue of individual liability and joint several liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.296" offset="8745709">On the question of causation damages -- and I won't repeat the legal points made by my colleagues, but solely the facts -- the sole basis for this $36 million judgment against the Piper individuals hangs on three communications sent by Piper management in January of 1969 in the course of Chris-Craft’s cash-tender offer for 300,000 shares for $65 a share at a time when Chris-Craft needed about 620,000 shares to get control and at a time when it said right in its cash-tender offer that it did not intend by that cash-tender offer to acquire control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.201" offset="8957301">Now, the Piper contribution to Chris-Craft’s lost opportunity to get control seven months later hangs in the Court of Appeals’ opinion on a presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.707" offset="9019264">Chris-Craft tells this Court that but for the acts of others later, it was a sure winner and would have had a 99% chance of getting control; so that against the position of the party, the Court of Appeals nevertheless makes a presumption that the action of the Pipers in communicating as they did in January had caused this lost opportunity seven months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.101" offset="9136919">We say that it is conflict to the lesson of Mills, and I will touch that no further; we've covered it in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.363" offset="9169938">On the question of scienter, the District Court as trier of fact construed the two letters that was sent in January -- and I might say they are all reproduced in the reply brief -- construed the statement the management is convinced the offer is inadequate as a reference to the offer as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.021" offset="9276517">The Court of Appeals simply disagreed and gave its own construction, concluding that the reference was to price and based on its own construction declared that this letters were materially misleading and therefore, said the Court of Appeals, the Pipers or the Piper management in sending the letters recklessly and knowingly disregarded its obligations to shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.129" offset="9396994">Similarly with the other, the third communication, the Grumman press release, the Court of Appeals stated that one of the many terms of the agreement should have been specified in the joint press release put out by Grumman and the Pipers, the term, that is, that dealt with a right to resell the shares to Piper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.818" offset="9495737">The Court of Appeals said without that provision in the press release, there was a material omission and therefore, said the Court of Appeals, the Piper management, in issuing the press release, recklessly and knowingly disregarded its obligations to shareholders.</text>

            <text syncTime="2388.491" offset="9654457">But certainly it would have more relevance in a suit by a private shareholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.404" offset="9678072">Now, the District Court for Chris-Craft, let me say, would infer scienter -- and this is the only basis of scienter that I've already mentioned -- on the basis of the Piper management’s opposition to its tender offer and to Chris-Craft generally; but we say that opposition to Chris-Craft does not equate with intention to deceive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.848" offset="9779845">The District Court heard the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.560" offset="9790712">It heard William Piper; it heard non-Piper family management director witnesses on the question of these communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.263" offset="9833553">Chris-Craft stipulated that the letters were prepared by proxies listed and interviewed by counsel, and Piper testified that counsel advised them as to what needed to be said in the press release.</text>

            <text syncTime="2558.799" offset="10335730">There were two, one involving the Bangor &amp; Aroostock Railroad valuation and the other a violation of 10(b)-6, was that it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2570.045" offset="10380661">No, Mr. Justice Stewart, there was a violation in January at the time Chris-Craft made its tender offer, when the Piper family to discourage shareholders from accepting that offer made misrepresentations to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.021" offset="10436563">There were violations when Bangor Punta acquired its shares illegally in violation of Rule 10(b)-6.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.804" offset="10467701">There were violations when it announced its exchange offer, and there were violations when Chris-Craft’s exchange offer was competing head-to-head against Bangor Punta’s exchange offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.757" offset="10515557">But I really would like to concentrate on the two violations which Your Honor is referring to, because it is also a given in this case that the control that Bangor Punta has and exercises rests on 14½ percent of Piper stock which it acquired illegally, illegally in these two transactions, one the acquisition of 7½ percent for cash, the other 7 percent through a misleading exchange offer, and that without those blocks not only would Bangor Punta not have control of Piper, but at the end of the exchange offers, Chris-Craft would have been leading by 41 to 31 percent, and that was a lead which all experts, including their own, testified was virtually insurmountable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.000" offset="10740524">And finally, there is another point that I should address myself to right at the outset, and that is that Chris-Craft didn't come into court for the first time asking for damages; it came into court asking for what my brother Cutler said a tenderer should ask for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.777" offset="10823593">It asked for a preliminary injunction in late July of 1969 to preclude, to enjoin Bangor from having the right to vote the illegally acquired cash shares and from consummating its exchange offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.965" offset="10908335">It told the court at that time that if Bangor Punta was allowed to consummate the exchange offer, the contest would be over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.504" offset="10950548">And Bangor Punta at that time opposed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.181" offset="10961206">And it said, and I quote from its memorandum in opposition to that preliminary injunction that it should be denied, because even assuming Chris-Craft can prove the allegations in its moving papers at a full trial after Bangor Punta has had the opportunity of properly preparing itself for trial, a money judgment will fully compensate Chris-Craft for any damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="2783.354" offset="11233925">What happened was that after the Court of Appeals found the violations in Chris-Craft I and remanded to the District Court for relief, Bangor Punta with full knowledge of this proceeded to change the complexion of Piper, brought in a new chief executive officer and took other steps which the Court of Appeals in Chris-Craft II recognized made divestiture unfeasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.999" offset="11368508">But even in Chris-Craft II, we said, "Here we first asked for preliminary relief, they say get damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.250" offset="11397451">Now in Chris-Craft II, they say damages are unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.616" offset="11410930">So if damages are unavailable, give us divestiture", and they opposed divestiture there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2860.347" offset="11541856">And the Court of Appeals if you'll note in Chris-Craft II said it really was unfeasible, and I could explain the difficulties with it; but they threw up every obstacle to equitable relief, which is what we were really seeking.</text>

            <text syncTime="2906.504" offset="11726490">When they then opposed damages, we said, "Well, if damages are not available, then we will take divestiture, because an inadequate relief is better than no relief".</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.167" offset="11773197">They opposed divestiture, and when it was remanded finally in Chris-Craft II, the Court of Appeals said divestiture is impractical and unfeasible to award damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="2952.733" offset="11911437">That is a false issue here; but they had to oppose it by lawful means, and the president of Bangor Punta, Wallace, testified at trial that when he met them to come into the race, they were espousing a scorched-earth policy against Chris-Craft.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.860" offset="11979877">Those were his words.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.522" offset="11986565">Now, Bangor Punta entered in May.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.928" offset="12000148">It entered by acquiring the Piper shares, and it announced an exchange offer -- Chris-Craft also had a pending exchange offer in registration -- and at that time the contest stood at 33% Chris-Craft, 31% Bangor Punta; so it was nip-and-tuck.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.485" offset="12094398">And Bangor Punta recognized and the record shows it that the outcome would turn on certain blocks of stock that were held by large holders, principally the fund of funds, the Cornfeld organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.750" offset="12159495">And Bangor Punta was advised that these shares were leaning toward Chris-Craft, they were emotionally committed to Chris-Craft and that unless Bangor Punta could take these shares out from under -- and I'm quoting -- "out from under" Chris-Craft, that Chris-Craft would win and that Bangor Punta’s strategy memoranda show that only by acquiring these shares could it win.</text>
            <text syncTime="3039.565" offset="12258761">Now, there was one obstacle to the acquisition of these shares, and that was Rule 10(b)-6 of the SEC, which as it read and as it was interpreted by the SEC precluded a company that had announced an exchange offer from buying the stock of the target company for cash.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.913" offset="12340158">Now, this was a matter of real concern to the SEC, because in April it called Chris-Craft and its counsel Kravet down to the SEC, and it warned Chris-Craft that if it bought any of these shares for cash, it would consider it a willful violation subject to criminal penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.683" offset="12419257">And the counsel for Chris-Craft advised Chris-Craft to comply; Chris-Craft did comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3086.319" offset="12445797">It cancelled all orders to buy shares for cash, and it didn't buy another share for cash while its exchange offer was pending, even though the opportunities were presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.299" offset="12481637">Now, on the eve of Bangor Punta entering the contest, the SEC published this warning in a release.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.698" offset="12515283">Bangor Punta stipulated in Chris-Craft II that it read the release; and it not only read the release, but it received a warning from its counsel to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.673" offset="12575156">Bangor Punta said it relied on counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.871" offset="12583933">Well, no court here, District Court or Court of Appeals, has found that any of these parties relied on counsel in either the 10(b)-6 violations or the exchange offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.329" offset="12637850">But its counsel testified, and it's what he says and not what's said in a brief in this Court, and he said that while he differed with the SEC's interpretations -- and I'm quoting, and it's in our brief on Page 13 to 14 -- “We felt that under the circumstances we should take a conservative position, and therefore what we instructed management in effect was, or in substance, that in view of that language, we should not involve ourselves in the solicitation of any shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.608" offset="12766895">In other words, we thought that it was proper to buy shares of stock, but only if they were unsolicited and not over an exchange.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3173.687" offset="12795211">And he later went on to testify in accordance with the wording of that rule he instructed his management -- "instructed", these are the words -- not to buy shares from broker dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.325" offset="12837739">Really, what happened here could be summed up in the difference between the way Bangor Punta reacted to the advice of counsel and the way Chris-Craft did, because Bangor Punta went right out after these instructions and it bought first 40,000 shares of stock from 2 broker dealers, American Securities and Base Securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.699" offset="12931257">It stipulated in Chris-Craft II that it doesn't even claim an exemption on those purchases under Rule 10(b)-6, and in fact its counsel testified that they didn't tell them about those purchases until after they were made; so much for the reliance on counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.483" offset="12998444">More importantly, they went and bought 80,000 shares from fund of funds, and there they presented an issue of fact, an excuse at trial in Chris-Craft II.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.796" offset="13047659">They said that these shares were not solicited, and the District Court found against them and it said they solicited them; they actually flew off to the Bahamas to pick them up, and Bangor Punta never even appealed from the finding of the District Court that those shares were solicited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.449" offset="13122264">So that, in effect, all 120,000 shares were bought in violation of their counsel’s advice and in violation of Rule 10(b)-6, and it isn't as if Bangor didn't have a remedy if it wanted to contest the SEC’s interpretation, the SEC’s signals and instructions and directions here, because Rule 10(b)-6 contains an exemption provision, which says that if you feel that any particular purchase may not have a manipulative or a proper effect, then you go to the SEC and present your case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.589" offset="13298852">Well, if they had done that and if the SEC had agreed with them, then the SEC would have had to give Chris-Craft notice that it, too, could compete for and buy these shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.995" offset="13340439">So, what did Bangor Punta do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.744" offset="13347440">It just simply defied its counsel’s advice and went behind the back of the SEC and bought these shares while Chris-Craft was sitting there like a bunch of Boy Scouts.</text>

            <text syncTime="3563.170" offset="14353154">So let me turn, then, and I'd like to then return to the Bangor &amp; Aroostock Railroad spats, to the whole issue of standing, first under 14(e) and then under 10(b)-6.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.640" offset="14399025">On Section 14(e), the argument here, the premise of their argument, is that the Williams Act was passed to protect only stockholders and not to establish rules of the game, which would be for the protection of the contestants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.828" offset="14475825">I would submit to Your Honors that even if their premise were correct -- and I'll show you that it is not -- that the only way that that protection of shareholders could be enforced is by permitting the contestants to have a right of action, which is the conclusion that the various courts that have considered this have come to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.269" offset="14565582">And the reason is simple: Congress recognized that these tender offers always made at a premium above market were of great benefit, great value, to shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.972" offset="14612393">Now, who would make a tender offer, who would seek control, if he could be cheated out of it by illegal means?</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.218" offset="14645308">And you were told here, at least Congress was told, by the SEC that the SEC did not have the means to police these controlled contests made by tender offers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.443" offset="14702255">The SEC said the time was too short, their resources were too small, there wasn't pre-filing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.402" offset="14730049">Senator Williams himself expressed skepticism and pessimism, which I share, about the utility of shareholder actions in keeping these contests honest; and therefore if these rules which Congress wanted to lay down to end industrial warfare were to have any teeth and to have any meaning, then the parties who have the stake in the contest, the contestants, really have to have the power to police each other.</text>

            <text syncTime="3699.803" offset="14899740">Now, what was in Congress’s mind, because I'd like to address myself to that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3707.077" offset="14928788">In the Blue Chip case, the Court observed that the cause of action under 10(b)-5 was really implied in the absence of any indication by the SEC or Congress that there would be a private right of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.338" offset="14989810">Well, here there was a vast difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.188" offset="15009246">First, it was clear from what was said by both the SEC and by Senator Williams that a principal purpose of this Act was to establish ground rules, a code of fair play, which would protect both sides to the contest, and on the very pages that they cite for the proposition that Congress was concerned only about shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.905" offset="15172145">In the Senate hearings, Mr. Cohen said, "I should indicate, however, that the shareholders alone are not the only persons concerned" and noted that if the bill were passed it might serve to help the takeover bidder in certain situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3804.073" offset="15316759">But now let me quote Senator Williams, the Chairman of the Committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="3876.092" offset="15604837">More than that, this was a case in which the Act was passed after a long history in the courts of causes of action under Borak under Section 10(b)-5, and Borak was discussed before Congress.</text>

            <text syncTime="5254.014" offset="21116570">When I said that the issue of violation was not in the case, even as to 14(e), I should have mentioned that as our certiorari petition itself states and as the questions present state, we raise the question of whether damages are recoverable under 14(e) absent scienter in the Hochfelder sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="5274.327" offset="21197758">So that is an issue in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="5364.600" offset="21558875">But let's say one tender offeror for an injunction or to recover damages perhaps for the benefit of the target shareholders who are all members of that corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5376.981" offset="21608403">And I did say in answer to a question from Justice Stewart earlier that perhaps even a competing tender offeror would have standing to sue for an injunction to prevent injury to the shareholders.</text>

            <text syncTime="5390.243" offset="21661484">But the test, as I think the Chief Justice’s opinion in Rondeau makes very clear, is, can you show some injury to the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="5399.195" offset="21697219">And while I'm on that point and you have further questions, Justice Stevens, while it is true, of course, that some of the exchanging Piper shareholders owned Chris-Craft stock, it would seem to me, number one, that their injury is not of an injury of the kind we need consider here, because the principal violation is one relating to the Bangor tender offer, the one they didn't accept.</text>
            <text syncTime="5428.651" offset="21815084">They accepted the other offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.330" offset="21821771">Moreover, given a case in which some of the target shareholders are on one side of the damage and some are on the other side, Congress might very well have left that particular issue alone and said no damage remedy, just as the District Court really did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5449.147" offset="21897108">I'd like to come next to the question of whether the 14½% which Mr. Liman says were involved in the two violations was decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="5459.162" offset="21937128">You have an express finding on that from the District Court that after both of those violations at the time that the preliminary injunction was denied that neither party has gained control and both are in a position to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5476.535" offset="22006614">In fact, the Court of Appeals, when it was affirming that finding, said each side had an equal opportunity to gain control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5484.840" offset="22039841">What the Court of Appeals did was to misinterpret Mills -- and this is a point I don't have time for now, which will be covered in our brief -- to presume both that the target shareholders would have rejected the offer, and of course Mills invokes no presumptions and turns only on the point that the target shareholders were entitled to a clean and accurate prospectus or proxy, whether or not it would have affected their offer; and secondly, he made the presumption, which Mills certainly doesn't authorize because it said damages should be awarded only to the extent they can be proven, that the violation caused Chris-Craft to lose its opportunity for control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5525.922">Is that all the time I have?</text>
