            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="104448">We’ll hear arguments next in United States Trust Company against New Jersey and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.252" offset="301411">Mr. Milburn, I think you may proceed when you’re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Devereux Milburn</label>
            <text syncTime="52.981" offset="316353">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.999" offset="332340">This case comes from the Superior Court, Bergen County, New Jersey, a decision by Judge Gilman, appealed directly to the Supreme Court of New Jersey, affirmed largely on the opinion of Judge Gilman.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.323" offset="405692">We filed a jurisdictional statement with this Court, probable jurisdiction was noted and here we are.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.962" offset="436203">Let me say at the beginning before I start the statement of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.371" offset="453862">We have a stipulation among counsel of 387 pages plus exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.171" offset="477059">Of all the briefs, at least half are devoted to facts and they are lengthy, according to new standards, too lengthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.223" offset="509241">However, I would like to very briefly review the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.510" offset="538394">I would then like to discuss the question of emergency as it applies to the impairment of contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.224" offset="573294">I would then like to discuss the reliance of bondholders upon the 1962 covenant and then the protection afforded to bondholders by the 1962 covenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.202" offset="633166">The facts very briefly are that the subject after the report of a commission in 1921 a compact was entered into between New Jersey and New York establishing the Port Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.261" offset="681441">In 1922, a comprehensive plan was adopted, both of those have the consent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.494" offset="710384">In the comprehensive plan, I think without question, there was no mention of passenger traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.053" offset="740582">The Port Authority was conceived to handle the freight problem in the Port District.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.824" offset="767645">Things went along quietly until about 1927 and a legislation was passed requiring the Port Authority to take over the passenger Mass Transit problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.761" offset="815397">This legislation was vetoed by Governor Smith and I might add that Governor Smith was an architect of the compact and of the comprehensive plan and he pointed out on his veto message that the moving of freight was a primary, the soul -- no, I won’t say the soul, but the primary and the most important job for the Port Authority and the one for which they were created.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.140" offset="912990">The Port Authority thrives although the Mass Transit problem was chronic.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.175" offset="941098">In 1959, there was a legislative finding out of a joint assembly committee of the New Jersey legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.704" offset="987178">I would call your attention to page 16 of appellee’s brief and page seven of our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.206" offset="1037228">Page seven of our reply brief sets out this finding a little more completely shall we say than the brief of appellee.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="243.199" stopTime="244.593">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="243.199" offset="1077144">Did you say page 16?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="devereux_milburn" startTime="244.593" stopTime="423.858">
            <label>Mr. Devereux Milburn</label>
            <text syncTime="244.593" offset="1082786">Seven of our reply briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.152" offset="1089055">16 of appellee's brief, the blue one and 7 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.126" offset="1112879">It says that no doubt, the Port Authority could undertake an activity which would involve a deficit even a pendent one.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.135" offset="1148928">If you’re reading the appellee’s brief, that’s where it stops with a period.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.963" offset="1164288">But I would like to just continue what’s in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.455" offset="1174215">It could only do so if there was real assurance that the size of the deficit would be such that there could be no doubt of its ability to absorb it, an important addition.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.830" offset="1223743">Now, nothing came of that, but in 1959, there were rumblings about the H&amp;M, the Hudson Tubes.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.286" offset="1277555">The rumblings was such that were cause by the fact that a District Court had just decided that the Hudson Tubes could continue and gave them enough cash for two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.083" offset="1324680">It was obvious something had to be done and the Port Authority was looked to and it was suggested to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.108" offset="1356863">Now, the Port Authority was not unused to deficits.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.575" offset="1374730">Ever since 1931 and the General Reserve Fund, the Port Authority had gone on a pooling paces.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.412" offset="1414019">It took its revenues and it took its deficits and then mixed them all together, but we are talking about deficits.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.801" offset="1447560">Let me point out that, for instance that in 1962, the biggest deficit we’re talking about was $500,000.00 for the Newark Airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.428" offset="1498133">Now, all these deficits came from facilities which were expected to make money and most of them didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.969" offset="1528226">It took a long time for some of them, but they all, except with the one or two minor exceptions made money and the major deficit in 1962 was $529,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.387" offset="1585904">So, along comes the H&amp;M, and what it its projective deficit, $5 Million, a completely different bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.239" offset="1625401">Now, $5 Million was expected to level out at $6,725,000.00 over of a period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.801" offset="1667615">There are two fallacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.938" offset="1676184">It didn’t level out at $6 Million.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.869" offset="1691857">It leveled out, well to take 1973, at $18 Million operating deficit plus $7 or more Million debt service or $25 to $28 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.701" offset="1751207">Now, that is important because it shows how wrong people can be when they project deficits and as you will see that becomes very important later.</text>

            <text syncTime="471.349" offset="1989757">This is 1961 when he was beating up the investor consent for that $6 Million deficit.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.944" offset="2020164">The 1962 covenant, basically what it said was you take H&amp;M and you don’t have to take anymore railroad deficits.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.233" offset="2053287">There were limitations, but we’ve all agree that the cause of the PATH deficit at the moment, does no room for anymore Mass Transit Enterprises because they are all deficit and we’ve used up the limitations which were contained in the covenant.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.098" offset="2116817">The covenant was passed, the investments were made and things were quite until 1971, and $1,200,000,000.00 worth of bonds were sold during that period with the covenant in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.698" offset="2175227">In 1971, there was a hearing on our same old favorite subject in the Port takeover, Mass Transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.850" offset="2203752">In 1972, there were further hearings and New York repealed the covenant and Governor Rockefeller signed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.368" offset="2253908">This was too much for New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.675" offset="2263103">They thought that it was an unconstitutional act and they would not go along.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.217" offset="2281284">In 1973, we had more hearings and finally, what happened was, there was a prospective repeal of the covenant because it was thought that a Retroactive Appeal would be unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.945" offset="2344187">Included in that legislation was the original PATH Triborough-Kennedy Newark Link.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.849" offset="2383788">Now, in 1974, the covenant was repealed without any further legislative hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.582" offset="2430704">We can guess why it was repealed and we can guess right or we can guess wrong, we do not know why it was repealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.233" offset="2461320">We do know this, however, built into the covenant, there is a provision for changing it, from modifying it and that provision calls for the consent of two-thirds of the bondholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.315" offset="2505624">This may sound like a difficult proposition, but I might remind the Court that it was done in the Triborough Bridge Authority case where the bondholders can set them.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.643" offset="2542926">They got an extra quarter of a point and they put out something like $305 Million which was applied to Mass Transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.178" offset="2573124">No effort was made to contact the bondholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.554" offset="2586603">I understand, it would be absolutely impossible to contact them, but I have to tell you that I understand that from being sovereign and from nobody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.559" offset="2622652">I do not know why they didn’t try, I know they didn’t try.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.106" offset="2640833">Now, we have heard, we’ve read in the briefs, a great deal of $40 million which is going to be realized from an increase in the fares over Port Authority facilities, George Washington Bridge, in particular they were doubled.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.816" offset="2711677">We are not sure they‘re going to stay double because of the Bridge Act of 1906 and because there are hearings, and because there is certain amount of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.845" offset="2743756">But right at the moment, they are doubled, and it is anticipated if they hold they would give out $40 Million.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.977" offset="2772281">We are told by appellees, this $40 Million would go to Mass Transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.986" offset="2788373">It said it was going to Mass Transit and the paraphernalia went along with the toll rate, but let me ask you this, how can it go to Mass Transit?</text>
            <text syncTime="680.914" offset="2828079">It belongs to the bondholders under the rate schedule, under the rate agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.607" offset="2846783">It doesn’t just go $40 Million to Mass Transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.501" offset="2858381">It goes into the PATH and what does that mean?</text>
            <text syncTime="692.296" offset="2873532">It means that between 1974 and 1975 the surplus of the Port Authority after a mandatory provision for the retirement of two years of debt service amounted to $296,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.178" offset="2945108">Where did the $40 Million go?</text>
            <text syncTime="711.378" offset="2949914">It went to increased expenses of the Port Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.457" offset="2962244">There is no $40 Million that we’re talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.997" offset="2976350">That goes into the bondholders PATH and what came out was $296,000.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.957" offset="3000174">If there is an overflow from or flow through of the $40 Million, it can go to Mass Transit, but the flow through we’re talking about is $296,000.00 which does not deal much with Mass Transit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2879.909" offset="11624030">Just last month, the Port Authority sold $50 Million worth of bonds at 7% coupon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.429" offset="11658094">With this case pending before this Court, the State having repealed the covenant, that is three-eighths of a point higher then the 35th series of Port Authority bonds sold for, with the covenant in effect and it sold at a time when every bond dealer that tries to sell a security with the name New York on it, finds himself with a drug.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.966" offset="11768226">So, that the notion that these record supports the proposition that the municipal bond market will be destroyed or even seriously impaired by permitting States to take measures that meet two conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2934.701" offset="11843250">The -- one of the witnesses for the plaintiff below was a fellow by the name of Murphy and he is an officer of Barr Brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.597" offset="11874806">And Barr Brothers is -- he was offered to tell us about the bond market too and Barr Brothers has announced as follows, this appears at pages 422 to 423 of the appendix, “Whether or not the Port Authority ever gets involve in Mass Transit, we feel it continues to be one of the finest revenue credits in the country, amply protected by the basic bond resolution, excellent management, and some highly profitable monopolistic facilities that can more than carry a reasonable amount of Mass Transit,” particularly with the recent toll increases that was issued after the Trial Court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.947" offset="12028197">“There’s no risk of default, nobody has claimed any risk of default.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.671" offset="12043034">The revenues are safe, the reserves are safe.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.130" offset="12052961">There are bondholder protections here that the General Solicitor of the Port Authority described as precluded any assumption of Mass Transit responsibilities that would threaten the bondholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.836" offset="12111788">Our friends profess puzzlement as to how we can say that the covenant is an impediment to rational planning and at the same time that its repeal will not hurt bondholders by freeing up resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.182" offset="12169153">The answer is that the other bondholder protections save the bondholders from any project that could really threaten their security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.078" offset="12204680">All the covenant does is prevent projects that are threatening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.905" offset="12220040">It bans categorical, and therefore, it prevents even a project that wouldn’t hurt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.349" offset="12241774">There's no way that the Port Authority can pick up a Mass Transit project that would threaten security of bondholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.615" offset="12274897">And that was the opinion of Mr. Goldberg in 1961 before the adoption of the covenant and not made in the context in which he was peddling bonds.</text>

            <text syncTime="3090.485" offset="12466322">The reason being that on the day of the repeal -- on the day Governor Burn signed repeal, the plaintiff held a press conference and savaged these bonds, and said they have been gravely impaired.</text>

            <text syncTime="3135.086" offset="12644791">Nothing has happen to those bonds except that that original shake out, attributable we think to the United States Trust Companies damaging these bonds improved with the passage of the time, statements like Barr Brothers, the renewal of the of the same A rating by Moody’s and Standard &amp; Poor’s that they had always given it, after that initial savaging, people had a chance take a look into and do an evaluation and what they found out was that these bonds are terrific.</text>

            <text syncTime="3171.389" offset="12789927">The Mass Ports and New York ports last week were selling within a half a point of each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.099" offset="12808840">So, that there's no damage in the market, there's no damage in the light of Moody’s and Standards &amp; Poor’s -- the company that employs, one of the plaintiff’s witnesses says it is terrific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.886" offset="12847919">There's nothing to fear, go out and buy it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3907.837" offset="15735704">Mr. Milburn, do you have anything further?</text>

          <turn speaker="devereux_milburn" startTime="3910.634" stopTime="4166.703">
            <label>Mr. Devereux Milburn</label>
            <text syncTime="3910.634" offset="15746884">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3913.358" offset="15757855">I was wrong and I apologize.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.490" offset="15766319">I’ve forgotten Mr. Thompson’s statement about the obtaining bondholder’s consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3922.385" offset="15793904">I don’t know who in the State was in touch with Mr. Thompson so, they didn’t try it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3926.828" offset="15811668">But it seems to me they should have tried it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3928.716" offset="15819295">It’s built right into the statute so that’s the way to change it and that’s way to modify it, and I don’t think there's any excuse for not trying it because you think it isn’t going to work particularly and when it did work not to long before that with the Triber Bridge Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.896" offset="15875929">Now, increasing tolls I thought I’ve covered this in my opening statement, $40 Million, $12 Million it doesn’t go to Mass Transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.441" offset="15918143">It goes to the bondholders, it goes into the PATH and if doesn’t go into the PATH, there is a breach of the covenant with bondholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.334" offset="15949699">And there's another lawsuit and Dave Simmons is quite right I will be back, if that happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3966.660" offset="15971015">Now, actually there's $296,000.00 increase between 1974 and 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="3973.123" offset="15996928">Now, you’re not talking about $40 Million, you’re talking about $12 Million.</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.802" offset="16011557">You’re not talking about the $12 Million you need for PATH Plainfield.</text>
            <text syncTime="3982.065" offset="16032664">Is a State guarantee impossible?</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.992" offset="16044366">New York did it with the commuter cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.369" offset="16053875">New Jersey didn’t but New York did and they’re still there, some of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3992.379" offset="16073937">Now also, I might point out that the two Governors have prevented between them one through to one another a fair rise.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.347" offset="16113748">They don’t even do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4003.293" offset="16117614">They don’t even pass the five cents.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.701" offset="16127227">The Amtrak is running at a dollar, right next to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4008.922" offset="16140079">Two parallel tracks.</text>
            <text syncTime="4010.483" offset="16146348">Would the Governors give them a fair rise than dollar?</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.839" offset="16151782">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="4012.631" offset="16154917">They won’t.</text>
            <text syncTime="4013.577" offset="16158678">Why can’t the States do something except abrogate our contract?</text>
            <text syncTime="4017.027" offset="16172471">That’s what I would like to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="4018.237" offset="16177382">I don’t know the answer to that kind of question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4021.162" offset="16189085">Now, Mr. Justice Marshall you mentioned a new deficit in filling into the PATH.</text>
            <text syncTime="4030.011" offset="16224402">We’ve got ability, we all admit that, we’ve got one running about $28 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.926" offset="16244151">It was supposed to run six it is running 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="4037.242" offset="16253346">Let’s put another one in there and let's say that the commissioners are wrong again, a wrong by a factor of five again.</text>
            <text syncTime="4043.690" offset="16279155">Let say we got another $30 Million deficit in there and in the meantime PATH has gone up.</text>
            <text syncTime="4048.779" offset="16299530">We’re talking about a $70 Million deficit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.186" offset="16309144">Let’s have a little depression.</text>
            <text syncTime="4052.804" offset="16315622">Let’s have our airports slack off a little bit and they are going to default on the bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4059.276" offset="16341535">That’s why we don’t want a tremendous new deficit into the Port Authority and you can’t stop it because it comes in as a baby and it grows into a giant.</text>
            <text syncTime="4070.070" offset="16384690">Now, the plaintiff’s press conference, we savage the bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.808" offset="16403602">In my humble opinion, one of the major reasons of those bonds haven’t gone down further is because we are standing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4081.682" offset="16431083">I don’t know a bondman in Wall Street that doesn’t think that this is an outrage and we’re going to win.</text>
            <text syncTime="4088.310" offset="16457624">Now if we don’t, let’s see what happens to the bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.235" offset="16477372">Now, I just -- I if I could consider Mr. Murphy for a moment, Mr. Murphy made a statement which is quoted in our brief, that if you bought a car and you had a 12-month warranty and all of a sudden became six-month warranty, you wouldn’t buy a car from that fellow again.</text>
            <text syncTime="4112.209" offset="16553232">So, that’s what's happened to the bond market.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.408" offset="16562009">Now, Barr Brothers puts out their ads.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.916" offset="16568069">But what is there business?</text>
            <text syncTime="4116.955" offset="16572249">Pushing bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4117.640" offset="16574966">Who owns the Port Authority bonds?</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.935" offset="16580086">They do.</text>
            <text syncTime="4119.688" offset="16583116">They got to sell them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4121.033" offset="16588549">They just can’t leave them on the shelf.</text>
            <text syncTime="4122.796" offset="16595550">I put no credence on that and that’s an ad, that’s passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4126.670" offset="16611119">But Mr. Murphy was testifying under oath and I do put some credence in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4130.901" offset="16628046">Now, to sum up let me say this, I don’t think this is this case, is a case -- it can be decided either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4137.189" offset="16653124">It has been decided the way that I thought it was impossible, but it has been decided that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.718" offset="16675276">It would be possible to decide it the other way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.528" offset="16686456">I don’t think this is a fact case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4147.249" offset="16693352">I don’t think this is lower case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4148.607" offset="16698786">I think that this is a moral case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4151.657" offset="16711011">I think the State have repudiated their words.</text>
            <text syncTime="4154.470" offset="16722296">I think this case in its present posture represents a leak in the dike of state integrity and I think that this Court can stop that leak before it becomes an avalanche.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.216" offset="16765241">Thank you.</text>
