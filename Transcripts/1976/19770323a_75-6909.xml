            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100562">We will resume our arguments in Maness against Wainwright.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.216" offset="129401">Mr. Brummer, I think you have 17 minutes remaining of your time.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.501" offset="186557">Mr. Brummer.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bennett_h_brummer" startTime="24.270" stopTime="448.736">
            <label>Mr. Bennett H. Brummer</label>
            <text syncTime="24.270" offset="197633">The petitioner has based his constitutional claim on Sixth Amendment grounds as well as fundamental fairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.374" offset="226054">On the basis that the Voucher Rule had been applied to sanctify the testimony of Linda Maness, although Linda was clearly adverse within the definition of adverse set forth in Chambers, the petitioner was unable to cross examine her or to contradict her.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.734" offset="303481">This left her denial of guilt intact before the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.053" offset="320722">Her denial pointed the finger at the petitioner because he was the only other suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.421" offset="346218">The petitioner was also unable to get Linda to admit her guilt on the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.491" offset="370459">There was a reasonable prospect of doing this because Linda had previously made admissions against her penal interest with regard to this case on a number of occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.401" offset="414136">But defense counsel was unable to ask Linda, whether she knew in fact that the petitioner did not do it, because the Trial Court applied the Voucher Rule to preclude this enquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.288" offset="465649">Even if defense counsel would only have elicited from Linda that she had previously stated that the petitioner did not do it, this evidence would have had a dramatic impact upon the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.960" offset="520402">This is especially true in light of the fact that she had testified on the stand that the petitioner was alone at the time, along with the baby at the time that the baby was injured and that she had gone to the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.335" offset="581842">It is very important to note that Linda’s testimony is the only evidence which would point the finger of guilt at the petitioner rather than at Linda except for the confession given by the petitioner which he recanted on the stand and attempted to explain away.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.623" offset="670972">His inability to extract the evidence from Linda also hurt his ability to support the recantation of his confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.017" offset="704618">Under Washington versus Texas, the petitioner was entitled to use the testimony of the witnesses he had called to the stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.425" offset="734188">The situation here is very similar to the situation that this Court condemned in Davis versus Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.738" offset="763445">It is a deprivation of the right to confrontation and compulsory process.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.422" offset="782149">If you restrict a party to a single question suggesting bias or interest, when an adverse witness answers with a general denial and the party is seeking to adduce relevant and material evidence which is prohibitive in his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.752" offset="855501">Such restriction deprive the petitioner here form revealing the falsehood and bias in Linda’s testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.315" offset="885803">Also it may have appeared to the jury that the defense was engaged in a baseless attack on Linda and this may have hurt the petitioner as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.433" offset="926240">We would call the Court’s attention to the opinion of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in United States versus Torres which is based on this Court’s decision in Chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.399" offset="970126">The situation there paralleled of the situation in Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.019" offset="988621">We would submit that the rights to confrontation and compulsory process are clearly applicable without regard to whether a third-party confession appears in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.310" offset="1041702">We based this submission on the cases of Washington, Davis and Torres in edition to this Court’s decision in Chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.866" offset="1087991">As early as you direct appeal, the petitioner has argued that the Voucher Rule has been applied to limit the right of the petitioner to use the testimony of Linda and Dana Maness in violation of the Sixth Amendment principles set forth in Washington versus Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.876" offset="1159984">In Chambers, this Court set forth a balancing test for evaluation of the constitutionality of a clash between the Sixth Amendment and state evidentiary rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.704" offset="1203347">The two components are the value and validity of the rule in question, and the second is the impact on the petitioner’s ability to present a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.829" offset="1247860">With regard to the first component in this case the Voucher Rule is an irrational rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.224" offset="1277431">It promotes no state interest whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.912" offset="1296134">Certainly the respondent has not come forward with any defense or explanation of the rationale for the Rule, or the rationale for the application of the Rule in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.696" offset="1347334">With regard to the impact of the Rule on the petitioners’ ability to present a defense, we would refer this Court through the findings of the court below to the effect that the Voucher Rule undoubtedly worked to the detriment of the petitioner, and that some evidence suggesting his innocence was excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.980" offset="1436464">It is also important to notice that the Court said that the fact finding process had been impaired due to the inability of the petitioner to cross-examine Linda Maness.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.984" offset="1488395">Because there is no legitimate state interest to be a countervailing weight in the balancing test we submit that in the light of the findings of the Fifth Circuit, the conclusion is inexorable, that the record reflects a constitutional violation of the petitioner’s right to fundamental fairness, as well as the Sixth Amendment guarantees incorporated in the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.367" offset="1598005">In conclusion I would like to briefly address myself to an additional question which the respondent has attempted to smuggle before this Court in his brief on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.447" offset="1634263">The additional question relates to the exhaustion of the state remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.030" offset="1652653">We would submit to the Court that this case reflects no reason whatsoever, for this Court to depart from his normal policy to disregard a question when it is not properly before this Court, it was not presented to the court below, and if accepted by this Court would alter rather than affirm the judgment of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.099" offset="1740947">Additionally, substantively the argument is without merit.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.993" offset="1760487">The petitioner has presented to the State Courts a claim substantially equivalent to the claim presented to the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.278" offset="1793610">This is the test set forth in the respondent’s brief and in the Fifth Circuit case in Lamberti v. Wainwright, clearly under the exhaustion doctrine repeated application to the State Courts are not necessary and the mere possibility of success in State Court in light of the facts of Chambers v. Mississippi is no bar to federal relief in this case under this Court’s decision in Wilverding.</text>

            <text syncTime="459.083" offset="1936866">It was raised in a supplemental brief after the decision was made by the panel, when the Fifth Circuit tentatively agreed to hear the case en banc.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.824" offset="1979811">The court subsequently vacated, the order of granting rehearing en banc and no action was ever taken en banc.</text>

            <text syncTime="1013.432" offset="4154244">Your Honors, petitioner’s argument in this case is predicated on the mischaracterization that is solely because of an arbitrary finding the Linda Maness was not an adverse witness at the Trail Court pursuant to Florida Statutes 90.09 kept numerous facts from the Jury which would tend to establish a doubt of petitioner’s guilt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1071.112" offset="4384957">State Court has no problem with this Court’s decision in Chambers, but the factual situation in Chambers Your Honors is materially different than that situation which this Court is presented with in the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.882" offset="4448069">In Chambers the defendant was precluded from introducing dynamite, highly prohibitive, quality reliable evidence, evidence of his innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.218" offset="4509404">But in this case Your Honors, the evidence which was excluded smokescreen innuendo evidence with which petitioner sought to confuse the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1137.512" offset="4650570">I am merely stating that once you see the situation if actually has exists in this record that you will be able to see that what petitioner is setting up as a smokescreen and he wishes to analogize that smokescreen to the solid evidence, the dynamite evidence that Chambers had which so concern this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.359" offset="4717966">Thus Your Honors the Chambers was decided not only on evidentiary principles but most importantly, as Justice Powell emphasized in his opinion, was decided on the totality of the circumstances that were before this Court when it rendered Chambers decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.251" offset="4789542">Second concept we ask you to filter and we subsequently get to the facts what actually occurred in this case, is that in Chambers, this Court to painstaking efforts to clarify one proposition that the state and the defense must still follow the Rules and Evidence and those Rules of Evidence Your Honors that this Court require both sides to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.044" offset="4896644">The rules which in fact are based on a theory that these rules enhance the integrity of the fact finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.960" offset="4936350">This Court did not hold in Chambers that every evidentiary ruling becomes a constitutional question regardless of whether that Rule of Evidence enhances the truth finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.576" offset="4986818">This Court did not state that the mere preclusion of any evidence denies due process if it in some way hampers the defendant to presenting his case of and creating some doubt of guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.022" offset="5044601">If such were the test Your Honors which is an essence what the defendant is stating to this Court, if such were the test there would be no Rules of Evidence which could withstand a due process attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.837" offset="5103847">In this respect Your Honors, the Maness situation is directly opposite the rationale of Chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.396" offset="5134044">In Maness Rules and Evidence which kept up the evidence were rules designed to ensure the integrity of the truth finding process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1945.608" offset="7882962">Page 86, counsel starts to inquire and the Court does not say you are not allowed to impeach Linda Maness because she is never going to be an adverse witness and we are cutting it off right now, such as it was the situation in Chambers, where in Chambers this the Trial Court had all the facts at the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.840" offset="7959866">What she is stating is, just ask her questions that are not leading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.607" offset="7978988">Now, we go down a little bit and we start the testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.603" offset="7990900">One of the questions is, with regard to a bruise that this baby had in the morning, the defense ask, how did that baby get the bruise on her forehead?</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.118" offset="8033009">Does Linda Maness turn around and say, Gary, my husband did it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.654" offset="8047115">No Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.930" offset="8052235">What does she say?</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.382" offset="8058087">She say, I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.062" offset="8068745">This is an adverse way, that he wants to call adverse, it was pointing the finger to her husband, I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.501" offset="8098524">Then the Court merely states after that, well I think we just return at them narrative events that you are starting to ask of me -- narrative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.787" offset="8135618">That is all the Court says, it does not say, do not impeach, because we have got to look what the Trial Judge is doing to petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.862" offset="8175951">Page 88, there is an objection regarding hearsay, the Court sustains on hearsay grounds and not the adverse with this rule. Counsel then asked, “Did you tell anybody anytime how that baby was injured?”</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.766" offset="8227569">And this is the answer of petitioner, what have you believe, is on adverse witness, “No, I did know how she was injured.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.499" offset="8258498">She is not testified against petitioner Maness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.288" offset="8273649">Then the Court says, let us start talking about, or the defense starts talking about the letter we got day-to-day for 28, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.576" offset="8314818">It is a letter that is a marked, he just gets up there and says, read this letter to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.025" offset="8340627">Now, a letter that has not even introduced in evidence or just even been sought to be introduced into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.768" offset="8367586">Mr. McWilliams (ph) suggest there is no proper predicate that the Court should sustain, what does a court do with regard to this letter, in spite of the fact that it is not introduced, in spite of anything this Court bends over backwards and says, let me see that letter you are starting to talk about now, the specific letter, the April 28th, letter which you want to have read to jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.208" offset="8449297">And this has done as the Court emphasizes, knowing that it has not even been even marked for identification, Your Honors, is bending backwards, over backwards to try and be fair to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.164" offset="8493182">She looks in that letter and she makes an unchallenged ruling after looking at that letter and states that all this letter shows is that Linda Maness loves her husband, it does not show adversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.985" offset="8552428">Then the Court asks, is there something you attempting to impeach this witness on?</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.912" offset="8576147">There has been no question asked along these lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.706" offset="8587328">That is an indication Your Honors, not that petitioner will never be allowed to impeach but just that this Court having heard no inconsistent statement states not now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.882" offset="8652007">He then proceeds on and the Court says, you can not get this letter on to evidence unless there is something she says that is contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.750" offset="8683458">You want to impeach by an inconsistent statement, you have to have some statement for which the evidence you are going to use as inconsistence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.175" offset="8713238">This is not a Trial Judge that is saying you can never impeach because of the Voucher Rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.572" offset="8738838">Defense counsel says, well, I have got another letter, eventually this letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.078" offset="8752840">The Trial Judge that they would have you believe is acting arbitrarily in keeping our all of this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.507" offset="8774573">She says, okay I will look at that letter also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.392" offset="8790038">She categorizes an objection again, on the basis of that pleading, not the petitioner Maness will never be allowed to impeach, and all this court says is everything you have shown me, and obviously in this case, petitioner never showed all these letters, that the Court never said, I will never look it all these letters, I will look at everything you got.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.606" offset="8898916">The Court says, all you show me as a bunch of love letters so far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.937" offset="8916262">This is not an adverse witness yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.703" offset="8935279">Then Mr. Minkess (ph) something that would be very important in this Court’s review of this various items or evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.707" offset="8959311">He explains why he wants us to use this letters as a substantive evidence of guilt, but he says in Page 90, he says these letters can come in from impeachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.632" offset="8999018">Now, what does the Court say?</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.421" offset="9002152">Does the Court say you can never use these letters for impeachment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.487" offset="9014482">This Court judge did not preclude arbitrarily in impeachment of this witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.797" offset="9035693">She says, but there is nothing to impeach yet, there is an inconsistence statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.112" offset="9072996">The Court then says something that is quite contradictory to the impression that petitioner wishes you to get off the Trial Judge’s actions because right after this, this colloquy occurs at the Court, but there is nothing to impeach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.379" offset="9126077">Mr. Minkess (ph) could I call her as an adverse witness?</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.033" offset="9136631">Then what does the Court say, do they say, do you want to let him, she is not precluding at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.261" offset="9165574">Then all she says is right after that, well, let us pass on the issue right now, let us go back to the original question you asked, and if there is something to impeach we can come to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.805" offset="9215729">And she says, I think that is the best way to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.074" offset="9236836">Then petitioner talks about some statement to the police or some statement regard to the being out the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.235" offset="9281453">In all the Court says is that this time she is not an adverse witness, these letters show that she is not an adverse witness, and then the Court says something that this Court said in Chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.430" offset="9334221">That is on Page 91.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.119" offset="9341013">The Court, “We are going to have to proceed by the Rules of Evidence counsel, she has not said anything for you to impeach.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.421" offset="9390227">At this point counsel talks about some letters to the police indicating that she never stated in that one statement to the police that she was not out of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.999" offset="9428471">The Court looks at the statement and says that there is nothing inconsistent because they never answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.347" offset="9453862">It is not stating that as petitioner would have you believed that what occurred at this trail was a precluding of his ability to impeach solely because of Florida Statutes 90.09.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.078" offset="9512794">Then there is another crucial point which we will emphasize subsequently during Maness ask his wife, did you tell your husband on particular date that she was pregnant, then what does counsel do, he does not get an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.754" offset="9575488">He withdraws the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.003" offset="9580503">This question has never brought up again, there is never testimony.</text>
