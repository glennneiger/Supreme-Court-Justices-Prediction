            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="2.680" offset="111190">Well, the legal principles involved in this case probably will not be regarded by scholars as being of the first magnitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.757" offset="143477">The facts are a good deal more interesting than the facts of many cases which this Court decides.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.433" offset="166256">DeKalb County, Georgia is located in the suburban Atlanta area and it operated the DeKalb Peachtree Airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.247" offset="201469">It also operated a large garbage dump located adjacent to the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.466" offset="222367">As might be expected, the garbage dump attracted a number of birds.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.879" offset="243996">In 1973, a Learjet crashed shortly after takeoff from the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.684" offset="267193">The alleged caused of the crash was the ingestion into the craft's engine of a large number of birds swarming from the dump.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.511" offset="302511">As might be imagined, the lawsuits came think and fast.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.248" offset="317453">The issue which has finally reached this Court on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is whether the right of the plaintiffs in these various lawsuits to sue the DeKalb County as a third party beneficiary of a contract with the Government should be determined under Georgia law or under what is called federal common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.374" offset="398014">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit sitting en banc held that the decision should be under federal common law. We reversed that holding of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.284" offset="441587">Although the contract on which the plaintiffs are claiming as third party beneficiaries involves the Federal Aviation Administration, "No rights of the United States are in jeopardy as a result of the plaintiff's third party beneficiary claims against DeKalb County."</text>
            <text syncTime="104.006" offset="516506">And so, we reversed the judgment of the Fifth Circuit and send it back to that court for determination of plaintiff's third party beneficiary rights under Georgia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.210" offset="553286">The Chief Justice has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
