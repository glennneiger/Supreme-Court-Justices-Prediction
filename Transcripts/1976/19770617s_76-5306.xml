            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="8.946" offset="136268">The petition in this case was convicted of murdering and torturing his children and was sentenced to death by a Florida trial court sitting in Jacksonville.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.482" offset="174406">The Supreme Court of Florida affirmed his conviction and we granted certiorari to consider his constitutional attacks on the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.987" offset="720470">We affirmed the judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.197" offset="720365">At the time the murder has occurred, the Florida death sentencing statute provided at the jury was to determine whether the sentence was to be life or death.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.498" offset="720261">Subsequent to this Court's decision in Furman versus Georgi, but prior to petitioner's trial, the Florida court's found that this procedure was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.255" offset="720156">The Florida legislature enacted a new procedure whereby the jury made a recommendation as to life or death but the final determination was placed in the hands of a trial judge subject to automatic review by the Florida Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.411" offset="720052">Petitioner was tried under this statute and the jury in his case recommended by attend of two-vote that he would be subject only to life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.595" offset="719948">The judge set aside this recommendation made the findings required by the Florida statute and imposed the sentence of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.508" offset="719843">Petitioner contends here that the death sentence had imposed upon and violates the Ex Post Facto Clause, the United States constitution, both because of the change in the role of the judge and the jury and because the Florida statute imposing the death sentence for the crime of which he convicted was later held unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.208" offset="719739">We reject these contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.537" offset="719634">Petitioner was on notice from the earlier Florida death -- death penalty statute that criminal conducts such as that of which he was found guilty was punishable by death.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.462" offset="719530">The change in the allocation of function between the judge and the jury and the imposition of the death sentence was procedural in nature and did not work to the overall detriment of petitioner since it provide him with greater rather than less procedural protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.716" offset="719425">This is true even though in petition is particular case the fact that the majority of the jury recommended life imprisonment would under the old statute have prevented the imposition of the death sentence upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.166" offset="719321">Petitioner has also claimed that this change in law violated the Equal Protection Clause and that he was denied his constitutional right to a fair trial by the refusal to grant his motion for a change of venue.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.338" offset="719216">For reasons more fully stated in the opinion, we reject these contentions also.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.474" offset="730396">The Chief Justice has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.231" offset="741368">Mr. Justice Stevens filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall joined.</text>
