            <text syncTime="90.292" offset="461638">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.918" offset="476162">This case involves the reapportionment of the Mississippi Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.585" offset="490790">The case was filed on October 19th, 1965 by black voters in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.133" offset="517017">It is here for the fifth time following a final hearing directed by this Court last term in Conner v. Coleman.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.177" offset="549200">In that case, this Court directed the district court to hold a final hearing to the end of entering a permanent, court-ordered legislative reapportionment plan to be applicable in the 1979 elections and also ordering any necessary special elections to be held to coincide with the November 1976 Presidential elections, or at the earliest practicable date thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.168" offset="661109">In November of 1976, the district court entered a final judgment, which was amended by its order of December 21st, ordering a permanent, court-ordered legislative reapportionment plan from Mississippi, which provides single-member districts statewide.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.173" offset="729132">No special elections have yet been held under that plan pursuant to the order of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.831" offset="751806">For the first time in this case, the district court complied with the 1971 injunction and the 1975 injunction of this Court that in court-ordered legislative reapportionment plans, single-member districts are to be preferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.588" offset="806872">Plaintiffs contend first that the district court’s Senate plan is excessively malapportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.807" offset="831741">Secondly, that the district court’s permanent plan unnecessarily minimizes and cancels out black voting strength in the Senate and in certain districts in the district court’s House plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.981" offset="880433">Three, that the district court erred in ordering special elections in only two House districts and in no new Senate districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.420" offset="914183">And, fourth, that the district court erred in denying plaintiffs their motion for an award of reasonable attorney’s fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.807" offset="947724">The District Court, in deciding the case and in entering final judgment, employed two criteria which are directly relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.513" offset="982519">First of all, the district court held in its opinion reported at 419 Fed. Supp. on Page 1076, Paragraph 4: “There shall be no minimization or cancellation of black voting strength”.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.087" offset="1036854">That was the criterion employed by the District Court, and as far as we can understand from the briefs of the defendants, that criterion is not questioned on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.245" offset="1069455">But everyone agrees it was proper for the district court to promulgate a plan in which there is no minimization or cancellation of black voting strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.214" offset="1105295">And fifth: "Population variances are to be as near de minimis as possible”, and that criterion is not the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.495" offset="1138418">It was the failure of the district court to follow these criterion in implementing its single-member districting plan which plaintiffs question on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.557" offset="1174676">The Senate plan is excessively malapportioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.479" offset="1186379">In Gaffney v. Cummings and in White v. Regester, 1973 cases, this Court held that in legislatively inactive reapportionment plans, a plan with a total deviation which exceeds 10%, is prima facie unconstitutional and must be rationally justified by legitimate State policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.473" offset="1266314">In Chapman v. Meier, the Court held that in court-ordered legislative reapportionment plans that the court must be ordinarily achieve the goal of population equality with little more than de minimis variation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1390.414" offset="5662095">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.145" offset="5677037">The United States has taken no position in either the District Court or in this Court with respect to the controversy about the adequacy of the District Court’s plan under the one person-one vote criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.348" offset="5741821">We have, however, taken a position with respect to dilution of black voting strength and with respect to the need for additional special elections besides those required for two House districts by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.380" offset="5817994">In neither of those instances, however, have we found it necessary to reach any constitutional question, nor do we see any reason why this Court should do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.869" offset="5863969">We've been taking our law from Chapman v. Meier, which distinguishes very sharply between what is constitutionally permissible if adopted by a State Legislature pursuant to State policy and the proper remedial criteria to be used by a District Court in the absence of an acceptable State plan in formulating relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1471.260" offset="5985491">And as a matter of the proper exercise of a court’s discretion, as an equitable matter, we believe that there were errors here in the court’s plan, which we have specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.447" offset="6050274">But before getting to those errors, I should point out that much of the court’s plan is acceptable, and after a course of very long litigation, substantial progress was made with the formulation of this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.209" offset="6141285">This litigation began in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.468" offset="6158317">Our own participation is much more recent; we intervened in June of 1975 in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.313" offset="6197710">But even so, I think that some of the contentions before this Court by the State parties have lost sight of what has already been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.390" offset="6238043">The case has been in this Court on four previous occasions, and a great deal have been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.487" offset="6262389">For example, a question has been raised about the propriety of the District Court’s adopting a plan involving all single-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.566" offset="6310768">Well, the decisions in Connor v. Johnson in 402 U.S. and the next Connor case in 404 U.S. said that the District Court was to favor single-member districting in the court-ordered plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.608" offset="6374924">This is what has become known as the Connor Rule, and it's late in the day not just as a matter of -- this is already decided; it's late in  the day as a matter of res judicata for the State now to be arguing that because of Mississippi’s longstanding policy in favor of multi-member districting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.154" offset="6445037">The Connor Rule should not be applied in the case in which it originated and in which this Court’s instructions to the District Court were quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.976" offset="6484325">If that question should be reconsidered at all, it's improper to ask that it be reconsidered in this case, in which it's the law of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.735" offset="6523404">And the District Court therefore quite properly favored a single-member district plan and in working that out adhered to the extent that it could to the State’s longstanding policy of trying to maintain the boundary lines of the counties, the Beats, the precincts, and largely succeeded in doing so, though we think that those aspects of the decision are really behind us in this case, and the question is whether despite the criteria that the court said it was utilizing in adopting its final plan, the plan fell short in achieving those criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.077" offset="6760805">We don't really attack the guidelines individually.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.113" offset="6772926">We don't have any quarrel with any one of them in particular as an appropriate guideline adopted by the District Court in formulating its final plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.877" offset="6815976">We do, however, attack the criteria that the District Court used in refusing to order additional special elections, so that our stance is a little different with respect to the two issues in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.618" offset="6870937">We think that those were inherently erroneous reasons for refusing to order special elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.714" offset="6895283">We don't think the guidelines adopted by the District Court in formulating its final plan were individually inherently erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.307" offset="6933736">Although we may quarrel with the weight given one as against another, the main shortcomings there were errors of omission as we see it, the failure to adequately remedy the longstanding use of apportionment as a method of diluting minority voting strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.285" offset="7041569">And the failure to recognize the importance in the case of voting-age population rather than just general population statistics, which differ considerably in the State of Mississippi from the realistic measure of voting strength that it's all we realistically talk about in assessing whether there is an opportunity for all elements of the community to participate meaningfully in the electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.877" offset="7203946">But the principle of Chapman v. Meier specifies that it applies to multi-member districting and to population deviations, and it seems to us that the same principle almost necessarily must also apply to remedying a pattern of dilution of minority voting strength, such as has been shown in this case, in which we've detailed in the record and in a lengthy Appendix to our brief and we've shown the extent to which these problems persist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.630" offset="7362980">Now, I want to address briefly the question of maximization against dilution as it's involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.615" offset="7410941">In Mississippi, the black voting-age population constitutes 31.4% of the population, and I am sorry we never drew these figures together in the brief in discussing the dilution question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.830" offset="7483770">We have compiled them just in the course of preparing this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.402" offset="7506026">Under the court plan, in the Senate, where there are 52 districts, there would be only 4, or 7.7%, as against the 31.4%, which would have what we think the record shows is the minimum-needed 54% of black voting-age population in order for the black electorate to have a working majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.674" offset="7639146">We have cited the references in the record that show that all of the estimates of what's needed for an effective working majority are 54% and on up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.559" offset="7682719">But even if you look at 50% black voting-age population, there would be 9 districts, 17.3%, as against the total of 31.4%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.842" offset="7735799">Under the alternative plans which were before the court which we have pointed to in our brief, and most of the difference between the plaintiffs and ourselves arise from the fact that the plaintiffs attempted and we don't say that this was improper at all to project their figures from the 1970 Census to approximate the 1975 population distributions, whereas in our participation we limited ourselves to the 1970 Census figures, which the District Court indicated that it planned to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.309" offset="7897654">Under the alternatives that we've proposed for the Senate, the number of districts with 54% or more black voting-age population would be increased from 4 to 6, or from 7.7% to 11.5%, and those 50% or more would be increased from 9 to 11, or 17.3% to 21.2%, still well under the 31.4%, which can be used as a starting point to see whether unnecessary fragmentation of black voting strength constitutes a dilution that should be avoided by a court of equity undertaking to remedy a longstanding pattern of discriminatory dilution of black voting strength.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.747" offset="8111440">And the same thing can be said of the House figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.810" offset="8127741">There's a 122-membership figure for the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.055" offset="8152714">There, under the court’s plan, 17 of those districts, or 13.9%, would have 54% or more black voting-age population, and 24 of the districts, or 19.7%, would have 50% or more black voting-age population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.622" offset="8230977">Under the alternatives that we point to, those figures would be increased from 17 to 22 for the 54% figure, which would get 18% black voting-age population, 18% of the districts, or in the 50% black voting-age population, the increased would be from 24 to 27 districts, or 22.1% of the total 122 districts, in each case still well under the 31.4% of the total population that is accounted for by the blacks of voting age.</text>

            <text syncTime="2112.180" offset="8549148">There is other evidence in the record to indicate that blacks are registered in lower proportion than whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.544" offset="8578614">So if you're using voting-age population statistics, they don't really reflect the strength at the polls.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.841" offset="8607871">There is testimony that whereas very few whites who are registered consistently fail to vote, about 10 to 15% of the blacks who are registered have never voted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2155.838" offset="8723855">Ideally, that is the answer; but the testimony indicates and there are no findings to the contrary; there are just no specific findings on this at all by the District Court that the difficulties with getting out the vote are to a large extent a result of the prior pattern of discrimination; that many of the older blacks are afraid of economic reprisals if they vote.</text>

            <text syncTime="2198.083" offset="8892815">Well, I wouldn't make any such argument without basing it on testimony in the record and evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.371" offset="8925938">I don't think it's the kind of thing that can be hypothesized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.619" offset="8942970">We are really addressing ourselves with the 54% figure to very specific evidence developed in the course of this long trial and there is the additional distinction that there hasn't been since the adoption of the Constitutional amendment entitling women to vote sex State-imposed discrimination that might result in intimidation of women.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.703" offset="9091241">At any rate, we are confining ourselves in this case to what this record has shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.457" offset="9122274">But even if we go down to the lower figure of 50%, as I indicated, we would still be well under the 31.4% figure if the remedies that we have proposed were adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.626" offset="9186954">Now, I just would like to say a word about the kind of dilution we are concerned with.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.440" offset="9214225">One example, which I think is fairly graphic, is to be seen on Page 55(a) of our brief, one of these pullouts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.586" offset="9258843">This one happens to involve Warren County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.859" offset="9271904">The point has been made before this Court that you can have the same kind of dilution as a result of splitting up a multi-member district so that each single-member district has the same basic percentages as would be true of the multi-member district, and the figures under the court’s plan for Warren County provide almost a classic example of that, where there is almost uniformity in the three districts here in the House in the percentage of blacks in each district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.603" offset="9430833">In each case as a percentage of total population, it is between 40% and 45%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.905" offset="9456119">The black voting-age population is more uniform, in each case between 39% and 41% and under our alternative plan, the alternative plan that was before the court which we mention there, one of those districts could be drawn in actually a more compact way, as shown by the maps on the preceding pages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.672" offset="9559146">So as to have a 56.6% black voting-age population, whereas the other two would be majority white, and here in a district in which the black voting-age population is close to 40% instead of having three majority-white districts, one of the three would be a majority-black district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.079" offset="9644828">That is the kind of deficiency that we have found in the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.516" offset="9662487">I just want to say one more word about a complaint that the State has made on Page 40 of its reply brief in Footnote 32 that somehow the difficulty here has been the failure of the Attorney General to apply the criteria of this Court’s decision in Beer to the State’s legislatively adopted plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.677" offset="9779202">The Court decided in 421 U.S. in one of the previous decisions in this case that that legislative plan would have no legal effect until and unless cleared pursuant to Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.771" offset="9835522">The plan was then submitted to the Attorney General, who interposed an objection on June 10th, 1975, many months before Beer was decided by this Court on March 30th, 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.813" offset="9891737">Of course, since this Court’s decision in Beer, we use the criteria enunciated by this Court; but at the time this objection was interposed, the District Court’s decision in Beer was the authoritative determination of the meaning of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.737" offset="9963417">There has been no submission by the State since that time, and there is no Section 5 issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.075" offset="9988808">There was nothing before the District Court under Section 5; it would have had to be before the District Court for the District of Columbia.</text>

            <text syncTime="2601.962" offset="10508332">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.297" offset="10537693">Our appeal here is from the 1979 court-ordered single-member plan for Mississippi and for two special elections ordered under that plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2620.130" offset="10580952">I will present our appeal in regard to the fractionalization of county lines and special elections; Mr. Leonard, associate counsel, will present our argument in response to the racial-dilution argument that has just been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.500" offset="10658483">I might say, however, in the beginning that I am quite surprised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.129" offset="10685024">I have been in this case for seven years to find the plaintiffs' attorney say this morning that they had not progressed from the one man-one vote to a guaranteed black district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2663.328" offset="10753778">That comes as quite a surprise to me, because I believe a good portion of this time has been spent developing that progress in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.533" offset="10818562">I also was surprised to hear the Government’s attorney say that we had been foreclosed in making our argument against a single-member plan that was ordered by this Court for the first time in 1976, in view of the fact that this case has been here, this does make the fifth time that the case has been before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.496" offset="10930470">But unfortunately, it has never been here on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.433" offset="10950219">We have never had the opportunity to orally argue the case, and this is the first time that it has been here on the merits itself and we're delighted that that time has finally come, because in the instance where this Court first spoke to the lower court in regard to its 1975 plan and we do advocate the acceptance by this Court of the 1975 plan as drawn by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.919" offset="11108103">We feel that that, then, has never been declared unconstitutional by any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.154" offset="11133076">In fact, the things that were spoken to here this morning were set out specifically by the trial court in reaching all of the objections they made there and when this Court first spoke to the lower court, it was in regard to Hinds County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.439" offset="11250209">Hinds County is the largest county in the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.423" offset="11262121">We have 82 counties in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.954" offset="11272257">We only have one metropolitan district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.715" offset="11283332">We are not a large state, in that we have cities like Chicago or Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.231" offset="11305380">Jackson, Mississippi is the capitol; it has approximately 200,000 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.168" offset="11329099">It is within Hinds County and so as a result, Hinds County is entitled under the 1970 Census to 12 legislators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.248" offset="11385419">This Court sent word back to the lower court that the plaintiffs have shown us that within three days, they could prepare four.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.596" offset="11450830">If I'm not mistaken either two or four, different plans for Hinds County to be single-member districted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.621" offset="11482908">Therefore, District Court, you should be able to do so, and we stay your order until June the 14th of 1975 until you prepare a single-member plan for Hinds County absent insurmountable difficulties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.543" offset="11550617">Well, when we held the first hearing back in Jackson, plaintiffs' counsel frankly admitted that the plans that he had submitted to this Court were based on erroneous information, and there was no possibility of those plans working it all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.216" offset="11625328">The Court appointed a Master and found that there were insurmountable possibilities, because the Census was taken by enumeration districts and not by the Governmental districts, that is, the County and the Beat lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.359" offset="11673915">So as a result of that, it was impossible within that short period of time, and the lower court so notified this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.608" offset="11702859">Then the next time when it came up, I think this Court, having seen it some several times, sent it back to the lower court and said, look, you have prepared a plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.030" offset="11764612">You have kept jurisdiction of Hinds, Harrison and Jackson County.</text>

            <text syncTime="2947.891" offset="11891985">In the meantime, we're going to dismiss the appeal, we're going to vacate the judgment so that when you fix Harrison and Hinds and Jackson County, we can get the whole case before us up here, and that was your order to them; and then you admonished them, of course that the lower court had said it would be ideal to single-member district Hinds County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.372" offset="12001909">You agreed with that and said to the effect what it was now known as the Connor Rule that single-member districts are preferable if multi-member districts can't be articulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.724" offset="12063349">So here we were with a rule that began to go all around the country that specifically as it applied to us, this Court had spoken to Hinds, Harrison and Jackson County.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.073" offset="12128759">They said, you single-member district Hinds, Harrison and Jackson County and send us the whole plan back.</text>
            <text syncTime="3013.746" offset="12155404">Then we will decide on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of that plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.826" offset="12175780">Eventually that was done, and I say "eventually" because there are implications here that there were people dragging their feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.853" offset="12207858">Throughout this entire period of time, the Legislature has been acting and acting and acting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.399" offset="12230114">Every time this Court came down with a case, they would pass another reapportionment plan trying to conform with it, preventing the lower court down there from going forward, because you also said it's better for the Legislature to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.521" offset="12294585">So the court said if the Legislature's going to do it, we are going to let them do it and then as soon as they got to the District Court, of course, then the constitutional challenge was made, and the plans that were referred to by the plaintiffs' attorneys here were plans that violated a longstanding State policy, which this Court has recognized in Mahan and Chapman, of never breaking or fractionalizing a county line, since it has been a State of this Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.107" offset="12464903">When it was admitted to the Union in 1870, the Congressional Acts that called the Mississippi Constitution together provided that two to six members be represented from each county in that Constitutional Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.759" offset="12531463">That was even before we became a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.372" offset="12541912">In the Constitution of 1870, there were provisions for multi-member districts in the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.711" offset="12571274">In the Constitution of 1832, there were provisions for multi-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.853" offset="12591858">In 1869, right after the Civil War, when the carpetbaggers and the scalawags, they are so-called, all joined hands, and they kept the multi-member districts; they made no effort to change them whatsoever, I am speaking to the dilution aspect, the racial-dilution aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.447" offset="12678271">Then in 1890, it was not changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.815" offset="12691750">So for 150 years, there has never been a person elected to the Mississippi Legislature by the breaking of a county line.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.804" offset="12859665">Actually, officially it's a supervisory district; but the words are anonymous, and it's referred to as Beats.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.429" offset="12894147">A supervisor is elected from each Beat, which is well-defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.191" offset="12909194">As he was pointing out here on this map, there has been litigation in Hinds County going on now for a considerable period of time, and it is up for a re-hearing and back in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals now and of course, Mr. Leonard will address what the judge had to say in regard to the dilution question in that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.343" offset="13001876">So there are 410 Beats, but the 5 supervisors in each county is the governing body.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.326" offset="13025804">We have a Chancellor Clerk, Circuit Clerk, Sheriff and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.357" offset="13037925">Now, the main thing about that is that they are autonomous, they are elected by the people of those counties, and of course they are answerable to nobody.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.201" offset="13069272">But the big difference is that they act in only administrative capacities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.625" offset="13098947">They have no power to tax; they have no power to set a judge’s salary, for instance, as the Federal judge’s salaries are set by Congress, I guess; for the entire United States, everybody gets the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.110" offset="13168955">That is not true in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.382" offset="13178046">That legislator from that county, if he wants his judge a raise, has got to come and get that judge a raise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.039" offset="13212632">There are as many different salaries for county judges in Mississippi as there are county judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.111" offset="13236874">The same thing is true for the County Attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.939" offset="13248263">In fact, even whether or not a county will have a County Attorney must be decided by the Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.485" offset="13274385">So if you fractionalize a county, you destroy the very fabric of which the Government of Mississippi is made up, and this is why we object so strongly to a single-member plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.657" offset="13319107">We are not against single-member plans, and certainly we're not promoting multi-member plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.778" offset="13343558">We are simply saying that as this Courts spoke to the issue in Mahan and as it spoke to the issue in Chapman and other cases, that you spoke specifically to the fact that longstanding State policies qualify to create variances that would not be acceptable in any other standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.545" offset="13434673">In fact, the Court in Swann spoke to the fact that there were about 30% or 35% and even indicated by stating in that case and it was a court-drawn plan that the results may have been different if the State policy had been articulated by the judge that drew it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.217" offset="13525370">And in this case, in the 1975 plan, the District Court articulated very clearly and very outstandingly the necessity for this longstanding policy in Mississippi.</text>

            <text syncTime="3417.700" offset="13771234">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.907" offset="13800074">I was speaking to the importance of the County Government as a unit in the State of Mississippi, and I had already enumerated a few of the most important facts; and I would like to add a few more to that, because the counties without special legislative authority cannot issue bonds even to build a courthouse or to provide for industrial improvements or to levy taxes for those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.361" offset="13889935">In fact, everything they do must be authorized by the Legislature, because they act, as I say, administratively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.121" offset="13924939">And of course, this is not done on a blanket basis; it is done on a county-by-county basis, because Mississippi has a local and private section in its Constitution very similar to that which Virginia had and even perhaps more stringent that the Court alluded to in the Mahan case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.777" offset="14007590">So you can see very clearly that to vulcanize or fractionalize the county lines would change the whole structure of Government in Mississippi, a structure that has existed since before its Statehood, and to diminish that would simply make vagrants out of the fractionalized counties, and it would affect the system of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.822" offset="14115737">It could affect crime prevention, cause electoral problems, cause economic problems, and it would affect the County’s ability to aid the poor, the disadvantaged, the old, the sick, through the various County programs that they have for that, because each of those have to be approved by the Legislative plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.572" offset="14198807">And to familiarize the Court with the '79 court plan, 42 of the 82 counties have been broken or fractionalized, and at least 44 of these supervisory Beats have been fractionalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.943" offset="14280204">Another important factor to point out there is that the precincts that the people of Mississippi vote in are contained entirely within a supervisory district or a Beat, and if you change a supervisory line or if you change a Beat line, as the plans that the plaintiffs have submitted to this Court do -- they cross beat lines, they cross the voting precinct lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.749" offset="14383440">It would call for an entire re-registration, and I think all of us would agree that as long and as hard and as difficult as it's been over the years to finally get the black population of Mississippi registered -- and in Mississippi once you're registered, you're registered for life unless you move out of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.326" offset="14457732">So you don't have to re-register every year, you stay registered for life and a change in this system if you had to change all of that could cause a massive re-registration and perhaps a dropping from the roles of many of the people who now can vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.882" offset="14527950">Speaking to one question that was brought up by the plaintiff, in the new plan, the '79 plan that fractionalizes the county lines, in the Mississippi House Representatives, there are 30 districts with a black population of over 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.076" offset="14608825">There are 40 districts with a black population from 36% to 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.290" offset="14629618">So 70 of 122 Representatives would be elected from a 36%, which is basically the percentage in the House; 70 of those Representatives would be elected from districts with 36% or more, and in the Senate 14 majority-black population over 15% districts and 12 districts between 36% and 50%, which makes a total of 22 Senators who could be elected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.160" offset="14761066">And as one of you said in an opinion -- I believe it was a Fifth Circuit opinion, though, in the Florida case that said if you've got that type of a population, you are going to be receptive to it if you expect to get their vote, and certainly they participated very strongly in the '75 elections, to the end that it was stated that the black vote was primarily responsible for the election of the present Governor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.582" offset="14878826">But, again, I'm not going to get in my brother’s argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.917" offset="14892097">I would like to address as my last point the fact that the District Court had no authority to order the two elections in the '79 plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.287" offset="14949566">Before a district plan can order a remedy, it must find a constitutional infirmity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.177" offset="14977151">This Court spoke to that in Swann v. Mecklenburg when it said that there had to be a constitutional violation before the great equity powers of the Federal Court could reach it, and the District Court found that this '75 plan was, in fact, constitutional, and it has never been found unconstitutional by any other court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.770" offset="15079551">And even if this Court were to find that the District Court was required to formulate single-member districts statewide and thus affirm the '79 plan, the District Court would still lack the authority to order the elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3758.911" offset="15136080">The reason being that the plan was not found constitutional and that, therefore, all of the legislators who were elected under the 1975 Court plan were constitutionally elected, and there is no decision to the contrary anywhere, regardless of the fact that the plaintiffs and interveners would like to convince this court that somewhere, these facts are all new that are being presented to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.098" offset="15236913">Everything that's been spoken here has been presented many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.296" offset="15261677">Thank you so much.</text>

            <text syncTime="3801.746" offset="15307443">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.569" offset="15330745">My name is Jerris Leonard, and as the Attorney General has said, I will address the question of the relief requested by the plaintiffs and by the plaintiff interveners and their entitlement thereto and also the question of racial dilution, which was alluded to in the questioning this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.470" offset="15430323">I would frame the issue raised in this case in this manner: in a state where blacks have total access to the political process, evidenced by the fact that 65% to 75% of the voting-aged blacks are registered to vote against a national average of only 55%, and where 60% to 70% of those blacks who are eligible to vote actually do vote, as compared to only 34% on a nationwide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.422" offset="15590193">And where blacks hold over 200 local offices, hold 25 of the 100 seats on the Democratic State Executive Committee, as well as the State’s Co-Chairmanship of the Democratic Party of the State of Mississippi, where blacks have played important roles in both the Republican and Democratic campaigns for Governor in 1975 and are credited with carrying the State for the President in 1976, where a report by the Department of Justice fails to disclose a single actionable violation of black voting rights, where the plaintiffs' key witnesses and their important evidence fails to disclose any vestige of racial discrimination against blacks in the electoral process and in the political process of this State, and where a reapportionment plan has been fashioned by a Federal District Court and it is found to be racially nondiscriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3940.953" offset="15864270">Based on those facts, the issue, I believe, is whether under such circumstances a Federal District Court, in fashioning such a plan of reapportionment, must first abandon a 150-year policy of non-fracturing of county boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3962.109" offset="15948906">Second, abandon a 150-year policy of using multi-member districts; and finally, affirmatively racially gerrymander the Legislature in order to guarantee or attempt to guarantee the election of a certain percentage of blacks to that Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.438" offset="16042216">Now, that is what I believe the issue is that's been framed in this case over its long history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3993.854" offset="16075861">General Summer has addressed the question of the State’s policy and history relative to the multi-member districts and their use and the non-fracturing of county boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="4005.478" offset="16122359">My argument will be confined to the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs, or the lack thereof, to a remedy and to the remedy that they seek.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.663" offset="16167081">And I trust that the Solicitor General will not take umbrage if I take the position that I think the Constitution is definitely involved in this case and that constitutional standards are applicable whether the plan of reapportionment is drafted by a Federal court or whether it's drafted by the Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="4039.985" offset="16260390">The Legislature in the State of Mississippi is one of the six co-equal branches of Government of our Federal system, and its reapportionment, as in the case of its 49 sister states, should be judged by constitutional standards and not by the supervisory power of this Court to direct something to a lower Federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4064.675" offset="16359133">So I think without question the Constitution is involved, and I think it's a Fourteenth Amendment question, Justice White, and not a Fifteenth Amendment question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4077.114" offset="16408975">Now, the plaintiffs' argument is fashioned around the scarlet-letter philosophy.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.616" offset="16430918">Having sinned in the past, no amount of reform, no matter how extensive and complete, will be recognized as having overcome the past, and the citizens of the State must forever bear the stigma of that past.</text>
            <text syncTime="4098.444" offset="16494239">Every constitutional question, it seems, that is raised by every action taken by the State must be viewed in the perspective of the past and not by the facts as they exist today, if we accept the argument of the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.158" offset="16557141">I submit to the Court that things have changed in the State of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="4118.252" offset="16573442">It is not the Tuskegee, Alabama of Gomillion v. Lightfoot, nor is it the Bexar and Dallas Counties of White v. Regester.</text>
            <text syncTime="4128.676" offset="16615133">The findings with respect to this case are contained.</text>
            <text syncTime="4132.020" offset="16628508">Contrary to a statement made by our opposition earlier today that there are few findings, there are extensive findings in this case made by Judge Coleman at 396 Federal Supplement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4145.136" offset="16680962">Now, that was a 1975 decision; but all of the evidence in the case except for some of the new re-workings of the reapportionment plans, all the basic evidence was in the case, and Judge Coleman made extensive findings in that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.126" offset="16761001">He found that the political process in the State was totally and completely open to black voters, and that finding is really not seriously disputed by the plaintiffs.</text>

            <text syncTime="4654.870" offset="18719976">Your opponent put the map up of the Senatorial districts in Hinds County with the two long fingers in Districts 32 and 33 going into the town, which are somewhat reminiscent of Gomillion and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="4666.651" offset="18767101">Where is the State’s explanation of why it was necessary to draw those rather unusual boundaries found?</text>

            <text syncTime="4674.318" offset="18797716">I believe, Justice Stevens, that the explanation is that because, as Attorney General Summer pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4682.306" offset="18829690">The County is an administrative and judicial more than it is a legislative unit, unlike our concept of County boards in the north, where county boards have broad home-rule powers, broad legislative functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="4699.632" offset="18898967">Such is not the case in Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="4703.108" offset="18912864">The County Supervisor and this is the history of the term 'Beat' had a beat that he walked apparently, because he supervised the roads, saw to it that the roads were taken care of.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.810" offset="18967721">He acts more like an alderman in a city taking care of the ministerial municipal functions of the Government, as opposed to acting as a legislator.</text>
            <text syncTime="4729.096" offset="19016831">Now, that is not in and of itself justification, as this Court has taught; but it is one of the factors that needs to be considered when you have draw an apportionment plan for that kind of a Governmental unit.</text>

            <text syncTime="5095.116" offset="20480942">That black citizens participate in that process in the party of their choice and to the extent that their desires and abilities carry them in that process; that the three-judge Federal District Court found its 1975 plan of apportionment of the State Legislature to be constitutional, to be in conformity with 150 years of official history of that State in the use of multi-member districts and in keeping county boundaries intact.</text>
            <text syncTime="5124.380" offset="20597971">That the deviation from the norm of the two Houses in that plan is within constitutional limits and governed by the facts in this case; and that such plan shall remain in full force and effect until the Legislature shall reapportion based on the 1980 Census, according to the laws and Constitution of the State of Mississippi and the United States of America; and that this case be remanded to the District Court with instructions to enter its final order in conformity with such opinion.</text>

            <text syncTime="5321.512" offset="21386555">First of all, they rely on the District Court’s findings at 396 Fed. Supp. 1308.</text>
            <text syncTime="5326.796" offset="21407662">Unfortunately, that district-court decision, which made those findings upon which defendants rely, was reversed by this Court at 421 U.S.</text>

            <text syncTime="5351.833" offset="21507763">So in reversing 396 Fed. Supp., this Court vacated those findings by the District Court, and the defendants can't rely on them here because they've been reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5362.371" offset="21549977">None of the alternative plans relied upon by the plaintiffs are split voting precincts or are based on supervisors' districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5374.903" offset="21600132">All of the alternatives upon which plaintiffs rely are based either on county lines, supervisors' districts or voting precincts, so those could be implemented immediately without any required re-registration of the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.844" offset="21659796">Now, the plan upon which the defendants rely, the 1975 plan, is totally invalid under this Court’s decisions in Chapman v. Meier and the other cases upon which we rely.</text>
            <text syncTime="5403.065" offset="21712772">In other words, in order for the Court to accept defendants' proposal to re-institute the 1975 plan, the Court have to overrule East Carroll Parish School Board v. Marshall, Chapman v. Meier, Mahan v. Howell, Connor v. Williams and Connor v. Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="5419.596">Now, the defendants made a big argument about what was in the record with regard to County Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5426.329">There was nothing in the record with regard to the question of how the Legislature runs County Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="5432.141">Judge Coleman was a former Governor of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5434.753">A member of the Legislature would not have ordered this plan into effect if it had been unfeasible.</text>
