            <text syncTime="13.774" offset="155825">The respondent in this case the Housing Corporation decides to build in the Village of Arlington Heights, Illinois a townhouse complex for low-and moderate-income tenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.036" offset="208801">The Village and suburb of Chicago is own only for single family homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.947" offset="232521">Its population is predominantly white.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.176" offset="245373">The respondent negotiated a purchase agreement covering a 15-acre site upon which it proposed to construct the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.538" offset="278810">But the Village authorities after public hearings refused to rezone the property from single family to multi-family classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.742" offset="327711">The respondent joins our individuals instituted this suit in an Illinois District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.448" offset="354460">They alleged that their refusal to rezone was racially discriminatory, violating the Fourteenth Amendment and federal Fair Housing Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.647" offset="395316">At the following trial, the District Court had a judgment for the Village but the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.745" offset="427708">Looking solely to the ultimate effect, the Circuit Court viewed the denial to rezone as discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.258" offset="461771">In Washington against Davis decided last time, we held that official action is not invalid solely because it results in a racially disproportionate effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.570" offset="514957">We held that proof of a discriminatory intent is required to show a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.148" offset="549334">In this case, the District Court found that the refusal to rezone was based on legitimate land use considerations and was not racially motivated.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.008" offset="596772">The Court of Appeals agreed with this finding, but nevertheless held that the effect of the refusal was determinative as this is not in a Court with our decision in Washington against Davis, we reserved the decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.331" offset="662078">We remand the case for consideration of the fair housing claim, a claim not resolved by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.485" offset="698650">Mr. Justice Marshall joined by Mr. Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in thought and dissenting in thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.359" offset="734176">Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.118" offset="749223">Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
