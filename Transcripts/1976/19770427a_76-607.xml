            <text syncTime="398.245" offset="1693475">A federal safety regulation of aeronautical interstate commerce extends to practically all phases of aviation and it specifically includes federally funded airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.471" offset="1746347">The primary purpose of federal regulation of aviation including the safety covenants involved here is to provide for the safety of interstate aeronautical travelers.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.490" offset="1798487">The extensive and pervasive federal regulation of aeronautical commerce by a necessity must preempt and preclude any conflicting local laws of policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.803" offset="1859718">This is simply a logical extension of this court’s rulings in Northwest Airlines, Inc. versus Minnesota, and City of Burbank versus Lockheed Air Terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.025" offset="1892528">Application of a Local County Immunity Law, to shield the county for liability for breaches of safety covenants imposed by congress, certainly does absolutely nothing pollster or enhance the federally expressed concerns for airport safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.798" offset="1991689">To the contrary, shielding the county from liability can serve only to emasculate and burden the federally expressed concern for aeronautical safety and for safety at federally funded airports.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.844" offset="2251868">However a lower court has held as recited briefs that sovereign immunity would exist under the limited example, Your Honor I have just gave.</text>

            <text syncTime="1087.121" offset="4448975">I want to suggest that there is a spectrum here of a reasonable possible result with area applied State Law of the Georgia third-party beneficiary exception to its general immunity doctrine being at one end of a reasonable spectrum and the implication of a federal remedy, under Cort versus Ash at the other end of a reasonable spectrum and while adopting both of those arguments, I think it might be more useful if I would develop myself primarily to the application of Federal Common Law to some or all of these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.747" offset="4607486">The irony of the case is the majority of the panel decision below, took the case as an Erie case construed properly, Georgia Law to find this narrow contract exception to the general rule of County immunity and granted us standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.203" offset="4689302">Judge Dyer (ph) who dissented from that said “No, this is a case where serious federal interests are involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.791" offset="4715633">This is the United States as a part of the contract, United States is a defendant in the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.841" offset="4739875">This is aviation which is federally preempted, so we have got to trial those case on the Federal Common Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.266" offset="4757534">Then he went on and found that as a matter of Federal Common Law, the old restatement of contract through 145 from 1932 would give us the less liberal and a result that we kept -- a standard we can not meet as third-party beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.098" offset="4824825">He ignored the recent cases including the Bossier Parish case which you Mr. Chief Justice set on the panel of with the Fifth Circuit ten or so years ago where you held that children had a standing to assert rights as third-party beneficiaries under an agreement an agreement between a County and the United States with respect to access to schools that was certainly a Federal Common Law decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.236" offset="4945406">The City of Englewood case from the Ninth Circuit is an airport grant agreement case which held that only the City of Englewood, but individual citizens there as the class could sue as third-party beneficiaries to enforce the aviation grant agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.193" offset="5009250">So, we assert that very clearly Federal Common Law is at least as liberal on the third-party beneficiary issue as this Georgia Law and I think this is ought to be put to rest by the fact that just about ten years ago, the restatement draftsmen offered a new Section 145 which brings doctrinal third-party beneficiary concepts in line with reality and so that we know there is no significance difference between the rights of third-party beneficiaries with respect to contract which government is a party and with private.</text>

            <text syncTime="2603.707" offset="10515339">In the situation before us which is only fortuitously and incidentally connected to navigable waters and which bears no relationship to traditional maritime activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.325" offset="10549821">The Ohio Courts could plainly exercise jurisdiction over the suit and could plainly apply familiar concepts of Ohio Tort Law without any effect on maritime endeavors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.535" offset="10586601">It may be as petitioners argued, that aviation tort cases should be governed by uniform substantive and procedural laws and it such action should be heard in the Federal Courts so as to avoid the diversion results and duplicities litigation in multiparty cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.657" offset="10643130">If federal uniformity is the desired goal with respect to claims arising from aviation accidents, Congress is free under the Commerce Clause to enact legislation applicable to all such accidents whether occurring on land or water and adapted to the specific circumstances of their commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.946" offset="10704257">I cite also with regards to that a bill that was introduced by Senator Tydings in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.944" offset="10732260">I have cited in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.593" offset="10738843">Senator Tydings suggested in his bill thought that there should be exclusive federal jurisdiction, a federal cause of action and a federal remedy for Aviation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.830" offset="10775832">The case though had substantial testimony in hearings was never reported out of committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.686" offset="10795268">It never got anywhere. The reason is because there is a body of State Law to apply and we contend that this State Law protects us in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.263" offset="10877501">Again, the suggestion that there are safety requirements that these safety requirements should be recognized by this court and thus create a private cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.300" offset="10909684">Congress has that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.478" offset="10918357">Congress has that ability and Congress has not created a private cause of action, a private remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.878" offset="10943957">Private remedy for wrongful death, which is unrecognized and we contend this Court should not imply such a remedy from a sovereign legislation and in an Executive Jet Aviation case, they refused to, in a bird ingestion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.423" offset="11010203">The citation of the City of Englewood case, we contend this, out of the Ninth Circuit and the alleged conflict in the federal circuits between the fifth and the ninth circuit that City of Englewood case is an eminent domain case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.447" offset="11066314">They recite particular facts. There was no injuries involved, no wrongful death, nothing such as that and they also distinguished because they say that non aeronautical users were involved. Here these people contend, they are aeronautical users.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.737" offset="11119395">So they recite those authority cases that do not even have a factual basis really.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.715" offset="11159310">Are there any other question?</text>
            <text syncTime="2766.840" offset="11167878">We are nearing 12 and out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.739" offset="11179477">But I am concluded with my argument; if the court has any other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.624" offset="11194941">Thank you, Your Honor very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2792.239" offset="11269442">On page a 22 (a) of our petition for sir, we incorporated the decisions in the courts below and I want to call attention to this court to the facts that in the initial panel opinion Judge Morgan of the Fifth Circuit said, talking about the Southern Airways versus DeKalb County case involving this precise airport, the court rule is since the Georgia Uniform Airport Law expressly authorizes a county to contract, “The logical inference of that statute is that the County maybe sued for breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.708" offset="11415310">This is consistent with several other Georgia decisions which hold that statutory authority to contract is necessarily a statutory waiver of immunity to suit for breach.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2842.467" offset="11470376">The contract in this case was a contract authorized by the Uniform Airport’s Law which is same type of contract we have here Your Honor, of FAA, Grant Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.483" offset="11510396">So the Georgia Law on immunity is that, “Immunity for a county does not extend to suits based upon contractual obligations.” And as Mr. Bush had pointed out…</text>
