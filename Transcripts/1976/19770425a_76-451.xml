            <label>Mr. H. Hampton Boles</label>
            <text syncTime="49.150" offset="297108">Mr. Chief Justice, I have asked for a period of rebuttal, so I will represent the first portion of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.596" offset="322917">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.174" offset="333157">I represent Alabama Power Company in this cause, who is the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.601" offset="350921">Alabama Power Company is an electric public utility engaged in the service of electricity to consumers in portions of the State of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.631" offset="387074">Except for a two-and-one-half year period of time in the military and a period off for a union strike, Mr. Davis was employed by Alabama Power Company from 1936 until his retirement in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.047" offset="448723">According to the provisions of the pension plan of Alabama Power Company, Mr. Davis’ time in the military was not considered as a credit in computing the amount of Mr. Davis’ retirement income.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.893" offset="508073">Mr. Davis is, to the litigation through the U.S. Attorney’s office, alleging that Alabama Power Company, notwithstanding the contrary provisions of its pension plan, was required to count the two-and-one-half year period as accredited service with the company in computing the amount of retirement income under the pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.073" offset="612772">The District Court in Alabama ruled in favor of Mr. Davis, reasoning that since the Alabama Power Company’s plan did not have a precise matching of units of work to units of benefit under the plan that the benefit was like seniority and, therefore, his military time must be counted as accredited service under the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.543" offset="722695">Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed Per Curium with one dissenting opinion, and this Court accepted cert.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.616" offset="751012">Now, although the monthly monetary amount involved in Mr. Davis’ claim is not very great, this case presents to this Court for the first time the precise issue of the proper treatment of military-service time under the reemployment provisions of the Military Selective Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.197" offset="833350">The facts below were not disputed and are set forth as agreed statement of facts beginning at about Page 15 in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.346" offset="869921">Now, we believe that this case is in a posture to be decided upon three fundamental propositions which we believe to exist with respect to the reemployment provisions of Military Selective Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.747" offset="927495">Now, first of all, we do not contest nor dispute that the Military Selective Service Act, that is, the reemployment provisions of that Act, were enacted to benefit the veteran.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.826" offset="983815">Primarily they were enacted and dictate that a qualifying veteran, upon his return to private employment, must be employed without loss of seniority and must be entitled to participate in insurance and other benefits that exist in accordance with established rules of the employer as they relate to employees on leave or furlough of absence.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.709" offset="1103352">Now, the second proposition which we have no contest about and we do not question is, if there is an employee benefit or any type of an employee advancement which accrues automatically by virtue of continued association with an employer alone by virtue of that time period, then the veteran must have his military service time count toward accruing that benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.564" offset="1222783">The third proposition, which we say is well-founded in law and applies to this case, is that if the employer agreement has in it a work requirement that is a condition to that benefit, then that work requirement must be satisfied by the employee, regardless of whether he is a returning veteran or just a returning employee from leave of absence before the employee becomes entitled to that benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.704" offset="1391325">Now, it's Alabama Power Company’s position in this case that accredited service under its pension plan can only be earned when one of its employees works for the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.274" offset="1441585">It is our position that that work requirement is real; it requires the employee to be present on the job earning regular pay.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="343.409" offset="1474186">Mr. Boles, is the plan clear in its application to employees who are on furlough or leave of absence?</text>
            <text syncTime="355.203" offset="1521311">I should think if it were, then this would be open and shut, isn’t it -- wouldn’t it?</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Hampton Boles</label>
            <text syncTime="359.659" offset="1539179">Mr. Justice Stewart, I agree that it should be open and shut, and it is our position that the case should be very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.862" offset="1567913">It is clear that an employee on leave of absence without regular pay receives no benefit under the pension plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.847" offset="1599887">He gets no credit for accredited service under the minimum pay provisions of computing income; he gets absolutely not one day of earnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.384" offset="1646072">As I want to go into, there are two provisions in the plan, both computing pension pay, and they are set forth in Section 5 of the pension plan beginning at about Page 60.</text>

            <text syncTime="404.096" offset="1716916">Mr. Chief Justice, it would be set aside on an actuarial basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.289" offset="1741680">And I do not proclaim to understand when it is done; but it is set aside on an actuarial basis, and there is no segregation of the fund per employee, if I answered your question.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.333" offset="1797895">Well, it must be at fairly frequent intervals to take into account people who either leave or take long-term sick leave, must it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="436.196" offset="1845334">Now, I would like to point out and you may have -- yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.764" offset="1859544">I cannot answer that question within any degree of certainty; but I do know that it has done as frequent as is necessary through accounting procedures to maintain the plan on a sound actuarial basis, and they do take this into account, yes, sir.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Hampton Boles</label>
            <text syncTime="458.923" offset="1936240">If you are speaking about Section 404 of the Internal Revenue Code, which states that payments into the pension fund are deductible in the year in which they are made, it is my understanding under the theory that they are a type of compensation to the employee and then the employee gets them as deferred compensation and they become taxable to him in the year of receipt and taxable to the employer in the year that it has given, yes, sir.</text>

            <text syncTime="497.731" offset="2091407">It states that the fund was not funded to account for periods of absence on military leave, yes, sir.</text>

            <text syncTime="514.429" offset="2158176">When an employee leaves to go into military, he does not have any type of contract which binds him to return to the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.719" offset="2187433">That is his free election.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.323" offset="2193807">If he returns within the time period that is specified in the statute, I believe 90 days, the employer has to accept him.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.460" offset="2226303">There is further no requirement that once he returns that he stay any length of time; I mean, he can return, stay a day and leave.</text>

            <text syncTime="542.745" offset="2271443">Lumley against Wagner forbids the specific performance of contracts for personal service as no employee is ever bound by contract to come back to his employer in a sense of an enforceable obligation.</text>
