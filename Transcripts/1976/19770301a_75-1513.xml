            <label>Ms. Patricia Rosen</label>
            <text syncTime="50.789" offset="303683">Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.141" offset="317058">This suit involves the constitutionality of Section 6-206(a)(3) of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.425" offset="350181">This section authorizes the Illinois Secretary of State to suspend or revoke the driver’s license, the operator’s license of any motorist without a preliminary hearing where the licensee’s driving record indicates that he has been repeatedly convicted of violations against traffic regulations indicating a disrespect for the traffic laws and the safety of others, or a lack of ability to exercise ordinary and reasonable care.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.688" offset="467210">Briefly stated the facts, giving rise to the instant suit where the plaintiff’s license to operate a motor vehicle was suspended for two months in November of 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.571" offset="514753">The suspension was pursuant to Section 6-206(a)(2) of the code, which authorizes the Secretary of State to suspend a motorist license when he has been convicted of three traffic violations, three moving violations within any 12 month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.947" offset="588313">Again in March of 1970, the plaintiff’s operator’s license was suspended for a period of two months, because he was convicted of driving while his license was suspended under the previous suspension.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.997" offset="636483">Subsequent to these two suspensions, plaintiff was issued three traffic citations which are relevant to this suit, and he was convicted of two citations, one in September and one in November.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.766" offset="695520">On March 27th the plaintiff received notification from the Secretary of State’s office that a further conviction would result in the loss of his driving privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.609" offset="730942">This conviction occurred on March 31st.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.906" offset="748078">On May 28th notice was mailed from the office of the Secretary of State, which plaintiff received on June 3rd.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.210" offset="781306">This notice informed the plaintiff that his operator’s license was revoked, the revocation to become effective on June 6th.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.929" offset="832193">On June 5th, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the District Court challenging the constitutionality of Section 6-206(a)(3) in seeking to enjoin the Secretary of State from revoking his license pursuant to the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.944" offset="888304">Plaintiff asserted that Section 6-206(a)(3) violated the Due Process Clause because it did not afford individuals the right to a separate hearing prior to the issuance of the order of revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.557" offset="938772">A Temporary Restraining Order was issued by the District Court, which was conditioned upon the fact, the plaintiff should apply for Hardship License which he did in June and which license was issued to him in July.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.991" offset="992480">Plaintiff’s request for a hearing by a three-judge panel was granted on the issue of the constitutionality of this section, and the Three-Judge Court entered its memorandum opinion in order on January 20th on Cross-Motions For Summary Judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.651" offset="1051099">The District Court specifically held the plaintiff’s right to Procedural Due Process was denied by the practice of the Illinois, Secretary of State under this section, because a separate hearing on the issue of revocation was not provided prior to the issuance of the order.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.384" offset="1114002">The District Court recognized that in practice, except the only issue which was taken into consideration by the Secretary of State’s office prior to revocation was the accumulation of points and these points were accumulated by a particular driver through his being convicted of specific traffic offences.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.633" offset="1199056">Each offence being designated a specified number of points.</text>

            <text syncTime="313.369" offset="1354015">While the District Court recognized that the points were the only factors which the Secretary took into consideration, the District Court determined that because this particular statutory section stated that the motorist must lack due respect for the traffic laws and the safety of other motorist upon the highway, that a separate hearing to determine these issues would be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.219" offset="1457355">Procedural Due Process would require such a separate hearing prior to the revocation or suspension of a motorist license.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.046" offset="1488702">We assert that this was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.738" offset="1499464">The fact underlying each of the convictions which any motorist would receive in Traffic Court have been judicially determined in a hearing which provides every individual motorist with all of the safeguards which are required by the concept of Due Process.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.731" offset="2183455">The reason that there is no need for a separate independent hearing has to relate back to the fact that the secretary has initially in his discretion promulgated a point system, and this point system is comprehensive and it takes into consideration variable factors.</text>

            <text syncTime="572.225" offset="2389404">If you receive 110 points you will be revoked, that is the way the point system operates and I would refer the court to rule 6204.</text>

            <text syncTime="1292.933" offset="5272277">All the court required was that the State holds a hearing to determine a reasonable probability of fault and that if such a reasonable probability existed they would be justified in suspending or revoking a driver’s license, and we submit that certainly an individual who has been repeatedly convicted of offences against the regulation and movement of traffic is/has already demonstrated a reasonable possibility or even probability of risk to other motorist on the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.446" offset="5410308">Once this has been accomplished, of course, at a later time, the State has a strong interest in removing such individuals promptly from the highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.298" offset="5453672">So that they will not be involved in other traffic incidents which might result in death or personal injury or property damage to other more careful motorist on the highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.091" offset="5496826">Of course Due Process would require a post-suspension hearing and that requirement is unquestionably satisfy hear by Section 2118.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.874" offset="5532039">We submit that a further pre-suspension or pre-revocation hearing is not required, because the individual have already had full adjudicatory hearings on traffic violations which are sufficient to demonstrate a high probability of risk.</text>

            <text syncTime="1425.123" offset="5800996">Yes Your Honor, I think that situation is very analogous, because I think when the police feel that there is probable cause to arrest someone, they are allowed to this because to allow this individual to remain on the streets, creates a risk to the rest of the society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.429" offset="5866197">And similarly in this case, I feel that once an individual has repeatedly demonstrated careless driving habits which have caused him to violate traffic ordinances or regulations which are obliviously enacted for the safety of motorist on the highways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.513" offset="5930563">The State has justified it that time in taking summary action to remove such a person from the highways before he does serious damage, either to himself or to other individuals on the highways.</text>

            <text syncTime="1520.840" offset="6183846">Well Your Honor, I can answer you specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.227" offset="6193459">In this case, I believe the plaintiff applied on June 10th for the Hardship License and it was granted on July 25th.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.486" offset="6222403">There is a hearing involved but the hearing is not in any way analogous to the hearing that is held under Section 2118 with extended length of time due to the fact that testimony and evidences taken at the brief hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.063" offset="6280708">So, I would say anywhere from three to four weeks would probably be adequate time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.701" offset="6303278">I would also like to point out that if an individual drives for a living -- oh I see my time is expired.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.327" offset="6349776">Okay, If an individual drives for a living he is automatically, if he requests the hearing, he is given a license to drive depending the outcome of their hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1573.702" offset="6395334">So, there are special protections for individuals who make their living through the use of driving.</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.521" offset="6422606">However, those particular protections were not involved in this case, because the plaintiff here did not request a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.240" offset="6461476">A mention, I would like to assert that we believe that the hearing which is given on each of the underlying traffic convictions is more than sufficient to satisfy the process requirements of a hearing prior to suspension or revocation, and that a further independent hearing by the Secretary of State’s office should not be required, and we will ask the decision of the District Court be reversed.</text>
