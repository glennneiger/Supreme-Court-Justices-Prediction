            <label>Mr. G. Dana Hobart</label>
            <text syncTime="76.392" offset="406054">Thank you, Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.873" offset="431968">Petitioner is here hoping to reverse the appellant decision of California, which took away from Richard T. Hill a judgment amounting $182,500.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.786" offset="475644">I think it will be helpful to the Court to have perhaps a little more of a sketch with respect to some of the facts that the evidence adduced at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.312" offset="513679">Richard Hill had been a member of Local 25 for a good number of years prior to the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.680" offset="539174">He had held many offices, and he had held offices with the Los Angeles District Council of Carpenters, with which Local 25 is affiliated.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.752" offset="575432">In 1965, Mr. Hill was elected to a three-year term as Vice-President of the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.367" offset="605943">Switch for a moment now to Mr. E. G. Daley, known affectionately among Union members as "Blackie" Daley.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.141" offset="633006">Mr. Daley was the Chief Business Agent of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.051" offset="652650">For all practical purposes, he controlled the affairs of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.282" offset="673653">He dominated the Executive Board, and he dominated the various governing boards of the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.777" offset="699566">When Mr. Hill became a member of the Executive Board, he after some period of time began developing a series of conflicts with Mr. Daley.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.138" offset="741048">He opposed Mr. Daley in many of the matters which were presented before the Executive Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.902" offset="764036">In retaliation for that conduct, at least at the beginning, Mr. Daley entered upon a series of vituperative acts directed toward Mr. Hill and which in our complaint below we alleged created intentionally severe emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.189" offset="833208">When the acrimonious situation reached its peak toward the very end of 1966, Mr. Daley threatened Mr. Hill on numerous occasions with words generally to the effect, "Either you go along with me in the Executive Board and the votes of this organization and quit criticizing me for such things as misuse of Union funds", which was one of the criticisms, "or I'm going to starve you out of this local.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.813" offset="935713">You will not work until you join the crowd".</text>
            <text syncTime="213.212" offset="953372">Mr. Daley promised this, and he carried it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.915" offset="968105">Mr. Hill, on the other hand, perhaps unfortunately, was not intimidated by this conduct and continued to oppose Mr. Daley.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.265" offset="1009483">Now, this gives rise to a series of events.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.584" offset="1022857">Mr. Hill was the victim of incredible ridicule in front of his peers.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.887" offset="1048039">He would be walking or standing around the Union hall with his friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.943" offset="1068206">Union officials would come up to the friends and tell them, “You better not be seen with Mr. Hill, or you're going to get the same treatment Mr. Hill gets," which was in a sense starvation, insults and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="253.002" offset="1112510">What you're telling us now, I take it, comes out of the record in the trial of the case in the State court.</text>

          <turn speaker="g_dana_hobart" startTime="257.284" stopTime="357.321">
            <label>Mr. G. Dana Hobart</label>
            <text syncTime="257.284" offset="1129646">It does, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.358" offset="1137901">Yes, it is in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.262" offset="1141558">Everything I've said is in the record and is evidence in the case, absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.602" offset="1162874">At any rate, the discrimination took many forms; but the form with which we're most concerned here, I believe, is the discrimination in the hiring hall, and the Court should fully appreciate two or three concepts related to the hiring hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.499" offset="1218462">The hiring hall concept of Local 25 was something that was provided for in the labor-management agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.723" offset="1243331">The Union negotiated with management, and part of that management agreement was the hiring hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.979" offset="1272379">Men signed the bottom of the list when they came from Unemployment for employment, signed the bottom of the list and eventually worked their way up.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.587" offset="1298815">The list many times totaled 5, 10, 15, even 20 pages, depending on how economic times were.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.831" offset="1323788">Two important rules with respect to the hiring hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.790" offset="1335595">One rule is that if a man works 16 hours, he is by virtue of having accepted that employment no longer eligible to come back to the top of the list; even though there may be jobs of months' duration, he must start again at the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.163" offset="1401110">This was one of the tools that was used to discriminate against Mr. Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.430" offset="1414172">The other, in addition to the 16-hour rule, is the refusal rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.320" offset="1433711">Under the local policy of the Union, you could refuse two jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.187" offset="1453251">If they were in the area that you had qualified yourself, two refusals would constitute grounds for removing you to the bottom of the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.186" offset="1489195">But you had the absolute right of qualifying your own self; in other words, as Mr. Hill said, “I can't handle steel form work.”</text>

            <text syncTime="357.321" offset="1529737">But you're not suggesting, are you, that the hiring hall in this form and that these regulations were illegal under the Federal labor law.</text>

            <text syncTime="400.775" offset="1703608">In other words, I suppose you're saying that because it's done under color of Union authority and somewhat as in civil-rights cases, that doesn't mean necessarily Federal preemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="418.153" offset="1773094">The problem is, are we now relegated to ascertaining the intent of Blackie Daley at each step of the way?</text>
            <text syncTime="425.595" offset="1802874">Do we say now it is personal, or is it still political?</text>
            <text syncTime="428.446" offset="1814263">It would be impossible to ascertain that.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.347" offset="1821891">I recognize they make the contention, but I think it is a meritless contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.123" offset="1836937">Let me summarize for a moment now what happened in the next year-and-a-half after this conflict developed into a full-blown war between the two people.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.791" offset="1875599">January 9th, 1967, Mr. Hill signed the out-of-work list at the bottom of the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.647" offset="1899109">He'd come off of a job recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.868" offset="1907990">By March 20th of 1967, he had reached Page 2 on the out-of-work list, which for all purposes is considered high on the list, very high, as a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.777" offset="1951563">Now, on that time when Mr. Hill had reached the status, a high status where hopefully he would go out and get a job of some duration, he was offered a steel form job.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.870" offset="1995971">Mr. Hill was a 52-year-old man who had a herniated lumbar disk; he was deaf in one ear.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.734" offset="2015406">He had never qualified himself for steel form work, and the testimony was it took young men to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.475" offset="2034423">It was hard work.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.743" offset="2039439">In fact, testimony in the trial was, it was undesirable work, which a good carpenter would never seek.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.797" offset="2063680">He was not qualified and not registered for it, but they offered it to him anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.581" offset="2078831">They said, “Here is a steel form job.”</text>
            <text syncTime="495.996" offset="2084474">He says, "I can't take that."</text>
            <text syncTime="497.669" offset="2091161">They marked it as a refusal, even though it was a permissible refusal not markable.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.073" offset="2112790">But what Mr. Daley did at that point was telephone the Department of Employment, and he told the Department of Employment that Mr. Hill is not eligible for his benefits, which he was living off of during this period of unemployment, because he had refused a job.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="518.703" stopTime="520.077">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="518.703" offset="2175275">That's Unemployment Compensation.</text>

            <label>Mr. G. Dana Hobart</label>
            <text syncTime="520.077" offset="2180813">That's right, Your Honor, in the State Department of Employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.063" offset="2196696">He interfered with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.843" offset="2199830">Well, they had a hearing and deleted something three, four or five weeks. He finally got his check, because he was not qualified for the work, he did not turn down a legitimate request; but it delayed him in getting his money, on which he was depending for survival.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.222" offset="2253329">All right, then, Your Honor, 11 days later on March 21st, Mr. Daley fabricated -- we proved in Court, we demonstrated that he fabricated a dispatch slip that was never handed to Mr. Hill, and with that dispatch ship he took the out-of-work list, wrote "refused", indicating that Mr. Hill had refused the phony dispatch slip, and now Mr. Hill, he said, you have two refusals.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.714" offset="2351341">You violated the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.955" offset="2356252">Mr. Hill goes from Page 2 down to the bottom of the list.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.724" offset="2371403">Well, this caused Mr. Hill a great deal of anxiety.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.849" offset="2383837">Mr. Hill was hospitalized three days later.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.007" offset="2400451">That activity occurred about the 31st of March; on April 2nd, he went to the hospital for ten days as a destroyed man internally.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.744" offset="2427409">They checked him, and there was nothing organically wrong with Mr. Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.875" offset="2444023">A month later, he was back signing the out-of-work list on May 1, 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.752" offset="2463458">Now, he signs and he also attempts to solicit for himself a job, which is completely permissible under the rules of the Union.The evidence is overwhelming in that respect.He goes to a project called the Dinwiddie-Simpson Project, and he says to Mr. Simpson, “May I have a job?"</text>
            <text syncTime="607.337" offset="2529809">Mr. Simpson says, “Yes, I'm going to hire you tomorrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.369" offset="2537959">We're sending in a request for four men, you'll be on that list.”</text>
            <text syncTime="612.415" offset="2550185">And on that night, they telephone in the list to the Union, and when Mr. Hill shows up the next morning expecting to be dispatched, Mr. Daley says, “Go to, and your honor is nowhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.728" offset="2587383">And you're not getting a dispatch out of here, I don't care who asks for you”, and consequently Mr. Hill did not get the dispatch.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.663" offset="2615177">Well, two things occurred as a result of the refusal to honor a legitimate Union request.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.995" offset="2636493">One, Mr. Hill went on disability again.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.904" offset="2648092">He was totally destroyed by this conduct, which had preceded it and now which was capped by this.</text>

            <text syncTime="1396.823" offset="5687804">Now, the fact of the matter is this: that jury did not know that there was such an award until opposing counsel, Mr. Geffner, until Mr. Geffner gave that jury that information in the form of a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.483" offset="5762410">On the report of transcript at Page 2684, Mr. Geffner asked the following question to Mr. Hill:  "Didn't you receive a payment from Local 25 of $2517.27?" to which Mr. Hill responded, "Yes."</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.696" offset="5823223">Mr. Geffner then introduced into evidence a copy of the check itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.497" offset="5842449">This was a tactical move on their part to try to get that jury to think that, well, Mr. Hill's already been compensated anyway; you don't have to worry about giving him any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.374" offset="5874005">And I even approached the bench and in a bench conference said, “Your Honor, I was under the impression that this was improper", because I thought it was prejudicial error to have that kind of information before the jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2097.319" offset="8489698">And we're trying to fashion something that will be of help to the Court and help to the lower courts and increase justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.418" offset="8510178">Keep in mind the one problem with the NLRB is this: if a matter is arguably an unfair labor practice, think of that vast no-man’s land that exists, and no case in the world could illustrate it better than your decision in Lockridge, in 1971, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.370" offset="8581963">If you recall in Lockridge, the Greyhound bus driver had been terminated from his employment and pressed to the Union, because he was behind in his dues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.669" offset="8623132">Mr. Lockridge filed a lawsuit claiming various things and got a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.563" offset="8642776">And it came up to this Court, and this Court said, no, that is arguably preempted, and the judgment was taken from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.878" offset="8667958">Mr. Lockridge’s colleague, Elmer Day -- and this is a footnote in that case -- Elmer Day says, “I'm not going to file with the court first.</text>
            <text syncTime="2149.436" offset="8698260">I know you're supposed to go to the NLRB", and he filed with the NLRB; but they declined to accept the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.576" offset="8722815">And so he said, “Now, I can go to the court.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.323" offset="8729816">So he went to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.517" offset="8734518">He got a judgment because he had been aggrieved, and the Oregon court took it away, claiming that it was arguably preempted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2214.867" offset="8959902">Even in Lockridge, Your Honor, this Court said that they couldn't find any express direction from Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.662" offset="8999086">And how about additional things?</text>
            <text syncTime="2226.365" offset="9005982">The fact that the LMRDA was passed in 1959; the Landrum-Griffin Act had savings clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.349" offset="9037852">It said we're not going to take away any of the rights that Union men have in their disputes or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.097" offset="9060839">We're not going to take away any rights that they have from State or Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.231" offset="9081424">When they passed that Act, they gave them certain other rights under that Act, as we pointed out in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.209" offset="9105352">Now, what did Congress think the law was at that point?</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.303" offset="9117682">This shows you Congressional intent, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.685" offset="9127190">At that point when Garmon was decided, I think like three days before Congress enacted the Landrum-Griffin Bill, Congress knew that the principle of Garmon was limited to Union management disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.056" offset="9196676">They had no reason to think that Gonzales was going to subsequently be emasculated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.484" offset="9214439">They thought that Gonzales was the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.263" offset="9225515">They also thought that Laburnum was the law and Russell was the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.939" offset="9240248">That's what the position was of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.507" offset="9250488">At that time, they said we don't want to do anything to interfere with those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.317" offset="9261773">And so when later courts began to assume that Congress intended under the LMRA that any internal Union dispute is preempted, I respectfully submit, Your Honor, that's an erroneous conclusion based on Congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2304.864" offset="9319974">This Court has never made that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.913" offset="9328124">The best that this Court has ever done to that side of the issue is to say we can't find any evidence of Congressional intent regarding that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.583" offset="9362815">Your Honor, if I may, if there are questions, I'll answer them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2353.588" offset="9514848">There were some verbal arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.230" offset="9525401">Mr. Daley and Mr. Hill were political allies and had run against each other in different slates for Union office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.773" offset="9551524">It turned out both of them were defeated in 1968 for different offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.466" offset="9570332">They were poker-playing buddies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.905" offset="9576079">They had lots of arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.815" offset="9583706">But from the beginning, motions were made before the trial judge from the very beginning of the case, from the beginning of the opening argument of counsel to the introduction of the first evidence, the first witness and the first exhibits that the testimony and evidence should be limited to exchanges that would constitute a tort in California of intentional infliction of mental distress and not have the jury try a hiring-hall case and that the dispatching procedures and the rules and regulations of the Union and how it was governed and how it was administered and whether it was a discriminatory or nondiscriminatory, not only against Mr. Hill but other carpenters that were involved, should be excluded from the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.974" offset="9772415">The trial court denied these motions continuously throughout the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2422.683" offset="9791223">And over the objections of myself, Mr. Hobart introduced not only the complete hiring-hall system, but also introduced originally the fact that Mr. Hill had gone to the National Labor Relations Board on one very large construction project in Los Angeles, the Dinwiddie-Simpson job, and that he had obtained a request from the superintendent; but that Mr. Daley had not honored that request and had not referred him to that job.</text>

            <text syncTime="3349.931" offset="13500193">I think there that the Radio Operators' case made it very clear that the Board is charged with responsibility as to whether there is Union discrimination of employment, whether it's a Union member or non-Union member, a good member or a bad member.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.156" offset="13553065">Therefore, if the Board has the primary responsibility under 8(b)(2), and particularly with some of the guidelines set out by Congress in 1959 in 8(f) to determine the operation of a hiring hall, then we have to look I believe to whether the jury infringed on that function of the Board so as to create a conflict as to the jury finding that there was prohibited activities where the Board may or may not have so found.</text>

            <text syncTime="3547.847" offset="14291912">The State had provided an additional remedy providing for punitive damages, which I think is very close to your question, for a violation of State tort law that had to do with interference in terms of secondary activities by a union, and this Court held very clearly that where the central focus of Congressional regulation was given to the Board having to do with job discrimination, employment discrimination, whether it's an employer on one side or Union on the other side, that that is a matter for the particular expertise of the Board under their administrative procedures, and if Congress said the remedy was, as it did in 3O3, to be compensatory damages, then the State couldn't superimpose an additional remedy of punitive damages, because the obvious conflicts would then exist.</text>

            <text syncTime="4369.234" offset="17577385">The court below found that the crux of the cause of action which went to the jury concerned Hill’s employment relations, and although there was an allegation of expulsion in Count 2, there was no evidence of any expulsion from Union membership.</text>
            <text syncTime="4390.047" offset="17660663">That finding, we submit, is amply supported in view of not only the allegations of the complaint, but Hill’s attorney's opening statement to the jury, in which he made it perfectly clear on several occasions that in order to understand the cause of action, you'd have to understand how the hiring hall operated.</text>

            <text syncTime="4421.946" offset="17788245">It was necessary on the cause of action and the gravamen of it as found by the state court, namely, a case of hiring-hall discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4437.475" offset="17850417">To be sure, there were other elements in the evidence; but the principle proof and the gravamen of the cause of action was hiring-hall discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="4451.741" offset="17907468">Now, in Garmon, in Borden and most recently in Lockridge, this Court has wrestled with the problem of when are you going to find preemption, and the key to the test that finally involved is the type of conduct that the state court lays hold off.</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.072" offset="18064725">Is the crux or the gravamen of the conduct the kind of conduct that Congress has made a principle concern of the Board's; and if it has, the Court has found it preempted, it is framed the test in various ways whether it's arguably prohibited or arguably protected or, as in Morton, whether it can be said that the Congress intended to occupy the field with respect to that type of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="4534.055" offset="18236715">So whether we take petitioner’s test or you take a Garmon-Lockridge test, the question as we see it as to the answer here is whether or not the court below was right -- and we submit that it was -- in concluding that taking this case as it was tried and went to the jury, the jury was required or could have made a judgment with respect to conduct that is central to the Board’s concern and could have evaluated that conduct differently.</text>

            <text syncTime="4615.128" offset="18560947">On this record, I don't think you would have had a different result, because the court’s classification of the conduct is a Federal question, and you'd have to look to see what was the proof that was due, what the allegations of the complaint were, what the proof was that was adduced, what the instructions were that went to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="4636.544" offset="18646629">And if you look at all of those things, I submit that had the California court classified it differently, it would have had to be reversed under -- unless this Court is prepared to overrule a long history of preemption cases that start with Garmon in ‘59, go through Borden in ‘63, and culminate with Lockridge in ’71.</text>
            <text syncTime="4667.994" offset="18772435">And since preemption is not a matter of constitutional principle, but of imputed statutory intent, I submit that the court would not, absent a compelling reason, which we submit has not been shown in this case, want to overrule that long line of precedent.</text>

            <text syncTime="4812.732" offset="19351413">I think that to say that Union member relations are different from Union management relations is an oversimplification, because with respect to part of the field of Union member relations Congress did enter it with the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4836.806" offset="19447648">It did so insofar as it involved Union control over the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="4844.920" offset="19480144">At the same time, it preserved from the Board’s purview that part of Union member relations that involved internal Union affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4858.117" offset="19532911">There was a body of state law that governed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4861.004" offset="19544510">Congress in ‘47 left that the state law. In ‘59 with Landrum-Griffin, it sought to add to the body of state law by providing some Federal remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4876.054" offset="19604696">But that was the purely internal area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4879.497" offset="19618488">At the same time that it did that, it recognized the continuing validity of preemption with respect to that part of the field that was entrusted to the Board, because although it considered at that time overruling this Court’s decision in Guss which created a no-man’s land, it made only that very narrow insert into the preemption doctrine by enacting 14(c)(1), but left the preemption doctrine untouched with respect to the remainder of the field.</text>
            <text syncTime="4927.423" offset="19810123">So therefore I think it is very important to keep our eye on what this lawsuit is about and not what other lawsuits could be in the future or what plaintiff could have made this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4948.697" offset="19895282">And I think the fact that it is tried on a tort theory rather than on a labor-relations theory only compounds the danger of interfering with the Federal regulatory scheme, because at least had Labor Relations' principles had applied, there could have been some possibility that the state court might have evaluated this hiring hall under the same substantive principles that the Board would have used.</text>
            <text syncTime="4987.961" offset="20052330">That would have been bad enough because of the possibility of conflicting fact findings and conflicting remedies; but where the jury was left to general tort theory, which had no standard other than what the jury would determine was outrageous.</text>
            <text syncTime="5010.175" offset="20141146">The possibility existed -- I'm not saying that this motivated the jury or not; but we can't speculate when we're left at sea like this -- that they could have found that even the operation of a valid hiring hall which committed this exclusive control over referrals for employment to a union was outrageous, despite the fact that this Court in Local 357 had indicated that a hiring hall run by neutral criteria was perfectly lawful under the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="5169.760" offset="20779475">Very briefly, Your Honor, a couple of comments were made, I think, that should have some comment to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5178.018" offset="20812598">To say that this case is not preempted factually, Your Honor, in the case of Garmon, Garmon has made the following statement, which I quote verbatim:  "Redress for arbitrary bad faith, fraudulent" -- I said I was quoting it verbatim, but that's not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="5198.314" offset="20893682">Quite right, I have included from several places the type of conduct; but it is a true incorrect paraphrasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.486" offset="20918446">"Redress for arbitrary bad faith, fraudulent, deceitful or other dishonest conduct does not conflict with Federal labor policy or is at most tolerably slight."</text>
            <text syncTime="5218.232" offset="20973408">In Hardman, the Court will remember that the Business Agent got hit in the nose, because he wouldn't dispatch a member, or a couple of men apparently, to a job where they had been requested by an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5232.981" offset="21032444">The Union claimed preemption in that case, too, arguably and unfair labor practice, they said.</text>
            <text syncTime="5239.060" offset="21056686">The Court expressly held that it is not an unfair labor practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5243.409" offset="21074136">Go quickly to Gonzales.</text>
            <text syncTime="5245.225" offset="21081346">They say, well, Gonzales is no good, because this was not an expulsion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5249.761" offset="21099527">May it please this Court, the worst penalty that could be imposed is not to make it an expulsion case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5257.771" offset="21131605">By keeping Mr. Hill in the Union, the wiser dictatorial-type tyrant says, “I can keep this out of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5266.205" offset="21165251">I can keep it in the NLRB.</text>
            <text syncTime="5267.737" offset="21171416">I won't expel Mr. Hill; I'll just knife him to death as a member, and perhaps with a smile on my face"</text>
            <text syncTime="5275.272" offset="21201613">Is the physical effect of Hardman, which is not preempted because he got hit on the nose, any different because Mr. Hill didn't get hit in the stomach, but nevertheless suffered enduring and longstanding pain?</text>
            <text syncTime="5289.505" offset="21258456">Those are distinctions without differences, and what it boils down to is what I was complaining about at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.919" offset="21288131">It provides for triumphs of procedure, not redress of the actual harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="5303.949" offset="21316239">Your Honor, the trial of this case was not a trial of the hiring-hall practices, not the legality.</text>

            <text syncTime="5314.452" offset="21358244">They used the hiring hall as the vehicle to impose upon Mr. Hill this discrimination.</text>
