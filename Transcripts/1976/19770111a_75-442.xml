            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100613">We will hear argument next in 75-442, Poelker against Doe.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.891" offset="308130">Mr. Freeman, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="eugene_p_freeman" startTime="54.895" stopTime="701.009">
            <label>Mr. Eugene P. Freeman</label>
            <text syncTime="54.895" offset="320146">Mr. Chief Justice and if it pleases the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.575" offset="338850">The nature of this case generally involves the assertion of an indigent pregnant woman that she has a constitutional right to require municipality to provide the surgeon and all hospital facilities to carry out her first trimester decision to be aborted.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.979" offset="416486">The city after this court’s decision in Doe versus Bolton did not recognize a constitutional duty that provide such abortions, but continued its policy against the establishment of an abortion service in its hospitals.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.772" offset="559637">St. Louis has two general hospitals and I say advisedly the last time I left St. Louis, indeed there is debate going on right now whether to abandon one or not, and they are physically separated from the other department or governmental buildings and that through the years it has reflected culture of the state which as the court well knows, Missouri has had a criminal abortion statute and that was infused within all of our civil governmental structure, including the hospitals and that situation obtained up till the time of this court’s rule and Doe’s decisions, and thereafter, although at that time there was considerable debate, confusion addressed to the problem, but there never any express direct changing of the established hospital policy against abortion and what I refer to as abortion is non-therapeutic or elective abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.187" offset="845312">This case rolls over that policy in the hospital and later changed by a trial tactic which shall allude to, by reason of the fact that an indigent lady appeared at hospital and our hospital does not allow practice by private physicians.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.908" offset="936218">In other words, all of the physicians in the hospital are governmental or city employees and are selected through civil service procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.841" offset="975924">The lady appeared at the hospital and went to the GYN clinic and then was referred to the obstetrical clinic of the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.851" offset="1019914">She was told that she was pregnant and there is some dispute in the position of the parties as to whether she asked for a non-therapeutic or elective abortion at the time from the physicians there.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.236" offset="1081459">Now the physicians at the hospital at the GYN and OB clinics represent a dual position.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.493" offset="1130569">Many years ago and I think I am accurate in telling the court that it was probably 20 to possibly 25 years ago, the City of St. Louis was some in accreditation trouble and the universities that provide medical schools in St. Louis came to the aid of the city and St. Louis University was one of those, Washington University the other, and entered into an arrangement where the physicians of the staffs in the medical schools would staff the various services of the hospitals and that was done with respect to the GYN and OB and in this case there is a vestige of that by St. Louis University which is Jesuit Catholic Institution in City Hospital Number 1 as distinguished from another hospital called Homer G. Philips Hospital which is City Hospital number 2 which was staff by Washington University which is a non-sectarian hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.441" offset="1394301">Through the passage of the years, the Homer G. Philips Hospital, the Number 2 encountered the difficulty of Washington University with its increased demands upon its own organic hospital facilities to the extent that the physicians were not furnished or at least in sufficient amounts by Washington University to that hospital where in the case of City Hospital Number 1, St. Louis University did maintain the OB and GYN services in the hospital in contention in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.145" offset="1529093">It has a state that is an accident of history.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.172" offset="1541214">The lady was refused of her request of an abortion after she was told that she was pregnant by several medical students who were associated with St. Louis University undergoing their training under the auspicious or ages of St. Louis University under the instruction of senior physicians who headed the various services there, including these two, OB and GYN.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.016" offset="1664616">The reasons given at the time were the physicians’ personal reluctance or personal morality or ethical positions against performing abortions on, in this case happened to be principally a financial indication, the lady was without funds, felt she could not do with her husband unemployed, felt she could not support another child and in this case the physicians there felt that they could not render an abortion service to a woman because of that type of indication without any medical, physiological indication.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.783" offset="1851653">The plaintiff or respondent here did not get the abortion, went to a private institution through, I believe the arrangement later counsel in the case and she was aborted on August 27.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.085" offset="1940887">Now, five days before that she had filed suit in the District Court, August 17 and this was before service was had upon one of the defendants here.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.386" offset="1982056">The case proceeded and in fine developing each of the facts in it, but attempting to allude to them as they come into because of the issues, the case developed three principal matters with two subordinate ones to one of them and that is abortion on demand and the appellant abuse of digression through unreasonably overturning the District Court’s findings and the appellant conviction and punishment of the Mayor, one of the petitioners here of bad faith and then there was the initial question of judiciablity or the standing and mootness of the question when it was existent in this District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.455" offset="2186334">There was a trial; an appeal on the judiciable controversy question, a reversal by the Eight Circuit with remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.016" offset="2236593">There was a trial on the merits with the reversal by the Eight Circuit and remand and then ultimate two appeals after that on the question of the attorney’s fees in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.265" offset="2309632">The Eight Circuit’s reasoning is based upon its finding of a denial of equal protection is based upon an assumption that child bearing and abortion are equivalent, and therefore, to assist childbearing, but not offer abortion is unequal treatment without legal justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.137" offset="2409106">In the arguments of some of the other cases, I think this question has been lightly touched, but I think I can provide a service to this court by respectfully suggesting a different analysis or an enlarged analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.118" offset="2465008">I think I could suggest to the court to contrast the universe of childbearing with abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.269" offset="2493638">I think the judicial point of view is required to be different in a case such as this than it has been in any other type of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.374" offset="2526030">Your Honor’s attention in the abortion cases, Roe and Doe and Parenthood versus Central Missouri and some of the others has been centered towards abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.887" offset="2572110">This case involves something far more broader than abortion and I think by respectfully suggesting these things to your Honors that it maybe of help in your Honor’s analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.306" offset="2629789">The court will certainly recall that childbearing is a consummation of a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.025" offset="2652672">It is a value of infinite worth, an event of incalculable consequences, generation as its process and life as its end.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.603" offset="2691020">Abortion is just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.869" offset="2700006">It is the prevention of the birth of the person.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.017" offset="2708678">It is the obliteration of the possibility of a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.316" offset="2721844">It is the interference with life and death or nonexistence as its end.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.969" offset="2744414">Childbearing is a natural process.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.466" offset="2754445">The attitude of the community, including the medical science and it is associated with in part is to support and assist childbearing, not to cause it, this natural phenomena.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.126" offset="2805018">Abortion on the other hand is an interruption and deliberate termination of this natural process and thwarts it.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.207" offset="2837410">In objective logical extension, childbearing is essential for the continuation of the human race, the family, the community, the state and the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.225" offset="2881504">Abortion is in an objective philosophical sense, genocidal.</text>

            <text syncTime="730.413" offset="3022252">Resulting from this essence is the individual relationships to childbearing and abortions are totally different.</text>

            <text syncTime="993.120" offset="4073002">In the political campaign for the Mayoral election in St. Louis, this question emerged and both the existing Mayor at the time and his successor who is one of the petitioners in this case both stated that they were opposed to abortion as a political platform in their election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.562" offset="4154817">They made that statement publicly and broadly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1037.694" offset="4251366">There is no evidence that the physicians at Hospital Number 2 knew anything about that City Hospital Policy and certainly there is positive expressed evidence by physicians themselves that they knew nothing about the policy in this particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3491.567" offset="14066824">All of these fees are presently now in the registry of the court having paid in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3496.333" offset="14085945">In conclusion, while it is true that the policies of the petitioners have not totally foreclosed abortions for women of low and marginal incomes in the City of St. Louis, the effect upon their access to services has in fact been devastating.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.941" offset="14148326">For no other reasons in the petitioner’s hospital policies, they have been denied the equal protection in the making of a constitutionally protected choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.242" offset="14181553">They have suffered in fact a cruel coercion of financial support to choose carrying the term, although against their desires and against in many cases their best interest of life and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.332" offset="14225857">To ignore the economic bait forces them to rely upon the charity and beneficence to the private medical sector for assistance, a degrading alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3540.594" offset="14262951">And lastly, we would note that to deny the indigent women the same rights of access to control over their own reproduction fosters a perpetuation of the cycle of poverty generation after generation and denies them an opportunity to escape and to rise above the conditions of their environments.</text>
