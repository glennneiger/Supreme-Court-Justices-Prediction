            <text syncTime="12.163" offset="149119">In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the provision of the constitution of the United Steelworkers of America limiting eligibility for local union office to members of the local who had attended at least one half of the local's regular meetings for three years previous to the election of officers did not violate ยง401(e) Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act which provides that every union member in good standing shall be eligible to be a candidate in the whole office subject however to reasonable qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.500" offset="326438">We disagree with the Court of Appeals in reserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.414" offset="342111">We hold that where a meeting attendance requirement, as was the case of this one, resulted an exclusion of 96 and a half percent of petition of local's members from candidacy for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.850" offset="399894">The requirement cannot be considered a reasonable qualification consistent with Title 4 goal and free and democratic union elections since the requirement having that result, restricts the free choice of the membership and selecting its leaders.</text>
