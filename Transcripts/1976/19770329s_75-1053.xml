            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="10.792" offset="143693">This case is here on certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.897" offset="164069">The question presented is whether the federal law governing net-weight labeling of packages bacon and flour preempts California law in the same subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.765" offset="207537">The petitioner, the director, Department of Weights and Measures in Riverside County, California is charges enforcing the state law with the Ninth Circuit held to be preemptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.558" offset="254766">California law prohibits sale of packing food commodities if they are contained in lots whose average net weight at the time of sale is less than the weights stated on the label.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.269" offset="297607">In contrast, the federal law governing bacon requires an accurate statement of the quantity and content in terms of weight but allows reasonable variations.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.508" offset="338567">The federal law applicable to flour makes the same allowance for reasonable variations.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.839" offset="359883">Since California uses a statistical averaging procedure to determine the average weight, its law as enforced implicitly allows for variations caused by manufacturing practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.506" offset="410560">It makes no allowances however for weight loss from loss of moisture.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.045" offset="428637">The federal Wholesome Meat Act which applies to bacon explicitly preempts state labeling requirement different than those imposed by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.486" offset="470433">An opinion filed with the clerk today, we conclude that the California law imposed a labeling requirement which is different than the federal requirement because the State makes no allowances for reasonable variations caused by the laws of moisture.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.006" offset="536470">The state law therefore is preempted by the expressed language of the Wholesome Meat Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.457" offset="558309">The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act which along with the federal Fair Packaging and Labeling Act governs net-weight labeling of flour contains no preemptive language.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.819" offset="603762">And although the Packing Act does preempts state laws that are less stringent than or require information different from the Packaging Act, we conclude that the state law does not fall within that language.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.423" offset="662172">Nevertheless, the California law is preempted because it stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.104" offset="704908">Without purposes to ensure, the consumers are able accurately to compare the values of consumer commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.542" offset="734688">Under the federal statutory scheme, this purpose is furthered because all packages contained the same amount of flour solids were packed and sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.939" offset="772199">They variant weight only because of gain or loss non-negative moisture content.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.640" offset="799053">Under the state law, however, packages was been taken different amounts of flour solids when packs and sold and consumed by comparisons would be distorted.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.967" offset="840327">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.752" offset="859448">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed an opinion concurring into part concerning the bacon and dissenting into flour part.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.607" offset="890900">In this opinion, Mr. Justice Stewart joins.</text>
