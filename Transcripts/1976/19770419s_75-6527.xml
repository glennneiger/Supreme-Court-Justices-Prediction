            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="11.585" offset="146821">This case presents questions concerning the use of corporal punishment in the public schools. Petitioners were junior high school students in Dade County Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.034" offset="188617">They brought this suit in the United States District Court against school officials alleging deprivation of constitutional rights and seeking damages and injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.028" offset="236578">At trial, petitioner's evidence indicated that they were severely paddled for relatively minor infractions of rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.878" offset="272000">One of the petitioners were subjected to more than 20 licks resulting in serious bruising and absence from school for 11 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.399" offset="310034">Florida law in keeping with the common law authorizes reasonable corporate punishment as a means of maintaining discipline but such punishment may not be degrading or unduly severe and may not be inflicted or maybe inflicted only after prior consultation with the school officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.039" offset="396656">Although the evidence offered by petitioners was indicated are violations of Florida law, the District Court found no violation of federal constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.812" offset="439706">The suit was dismissed without hearing evidence from the school authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.265" offset="461544">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed and we granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.956" offset="484323">Petitioners alleged two violations of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.267" offset="505534">They first assert with the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment applies to school punishment as well as to that imposed under the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.519" offset="554540">The use of corporal punishment to discipline school children dates back to colonial times.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.115" offset="580976">The law was then well settled but teachers had this right so long as excessive force was not used.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.832" offset="611801">The founding fathers were familiar with this practice and with common laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.072" offset="636774">Nor has a law been changed in 187 years since the adoption of the Eighth Amendment, 23 States have addressed this issue through legislation, 21 have reaffirmed the substance of the common law rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.189" offset="701244">Only two States have prohibited physical punishment in the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.161" offset="725172">In some, we find no basis for wrenching the Eighth Amendment from its historical context and extending it to school discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.676" offset="767177">Petitioners further contend that they were entitled by virtue of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to a hearing before being paddled.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.864" offset="811899">We agreed with petitioners that are protected liberty interest is implicated when school authorities restrain a pupil and inflict appreciable physical pain.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.551" offset="862681">But the possible violation of a constitutional right does not always require a prior hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.053" offset="892669">The basic question is whether other remedies long available or adequate to provide reasonable protection of the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.686" offset="927255">The remedies here are substantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.321" offset="937809">The common law allows the pupil to recover damages from a teacher who imposes excessive punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.408" offset="966125">Florida statutes also imposed both criminal and civil liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.132" offset="992979">Moreover, in the openness of a public school with a restraining presence of pupils and other teachers, the risk of excessive punishment is slight.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.917" offset="1032163">Indeed, the evidence in this case indicated that the punishment inflicted on petitioners was quite unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.543" offset="1062674">Common sense as well as long experience tells us that the risk of abuse of this traditional disciplinary measure is minimal and when abused, the consequences for the offending teachers can be serious indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.882" offset="1132055">We found therefore, no basis in the constitution for commanding a prior hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.296" offset="1157655">The remedy is already available have been accepted as adequate to protect children since the founding of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.189" offset="1189211">We decline at this late date and at a time when serious problems be set out of schools to impose an unnecessary restriction on all school teachers simply because a misconduct of a few in one school in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.962" offset="1256294">We therefore affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.836" offset="1275833">Mr. Justice White has filed a dissenting opinion, joined by Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.295" offset="1309688">Mr. Justice Stevens also has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
