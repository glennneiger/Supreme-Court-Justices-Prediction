            <text syncTime="46.823" offset="290670">Before I begin my discussion of the petition’s contentions, I would like to invite the Court’s attention to an error that appears in petitioners reply brief and I invite the Court’s attention particularly to page 8 of the reply brief where we have quoted a portion of handbook 67 and I’m looking down towards the bottom of page which starts with the words, “It is admitted that such indefinites and so forth.”</text>
            <text syncTime="88.578" offset="457644">Actually, that quotation ends in the middle of the sentence and we think this was a publishers or printing error and the full quotation actually appears in the appendix to the amicus curiae brief of 33 States that was filed in support of the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.817" offset="566627">I’m referring to the amicus curiae brief that is the first one filed by the several states.</text>

            <label>Mr. Loyal E. Keir</label>
            <text syncTime="144.416" offset="681044">I was going to suggest Your Honor that I would right a letter to the clerk and set forth the complete quotation so that we can correct the record if that is okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.846" offset="742797">This is a case which comes to the Court on a writ of certiorari right to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.728" offset="794311">It involves the enforcement of a California Statute and California regulations pertaining to the weights and measures of packaged commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.568" offset="849690">Actually, we have two separate but related cases here, namely the Rath Packing Company case which involves packaged bacon and the General Mills case which involves packaged wheat flower.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.011" offset="907368">Although, there were a number of issues that were decided by the lower courts the principle holding of both United States District Court and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is that the California Statute and its interpreter regulation are preempted by federal law, more specifically, the Federal Wholesome Meat Act of 1967 in the Rath Packing Company case and the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Federal Fair Packaging and Labeling Act in the General Mills case.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.630" offset="1073925">The issue of preemption is the only issue that petitioner has raised in the petition to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.264" offset="1112377">In discussing the inspection process that is followed by petitioner and other enforcement officers in California, I should first define a term that will be used during the course of the oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.043" offset="1187506">This is the term “Lot.”</text>
            <text syncTime="274.953" offset="1203179">A lot maybe defined as a group of apparently identical packages found at the same place and at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.372" offset="1248841">For example, 500 packages of Wheat flower found in a -- on a shelves of a Safeway Store on a certain date, each package stating that it contains 10 pounds net weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.608" offset="1301817">Now, this is a lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.733" offset="1314356">The inspection process that is followed by the inspection officers in California does not involve inspection of each package in a lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.249" offset="1364407">Obviously, that would be too expensive and too time consuming.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.734" offset="1390320">Instead, under the California System in Article 5 is how we ordinarily refer to the California Regulation, provides for lot averaging and this is done through random sampling.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.176" offset="1460120">For example, in the example that I gave in the lot of 500 packages, the inspection officer would select 25 samples and he would take them from various parts of this lot so that he would get a group of representative samples of the lot.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.933" offset="1567117">These are taken at random.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.495" offset="1577357">These packages are weighed and the net weight of the average is determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.581" offset="1613720">If that net weight is equal to or more than the labeled weight, then the entire lot is approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.151" offset="1655933">If the lot average net weight is less than the labeled weight, then the entire lot is ordered off sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.033" offset="1703476">Now, this system that’s followed in California is a statically valid system and it has so been held by United State District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.440" offset="1753109">One of the basic defenses that has been raised by the respondents is that the California System does not provide for reasonable variations, that is variations cause by discrepancies in manufacturing processes or gain or loss of moisture during the course of good distribution practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.151" offset="1883930">However, we wish to respond to this argument and that is that the California System does provide for reasonable variations and that these variations are taken into account through the lot averaging system.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.534" offset="1953520">In other words, variations are inherent by the very use of the lot averaging system.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.655" offset="1993958">Although, there is no specific mention in the California Regulation as to variations caused by loss or gain of moisture, variations under the state system can be for any reason or for all reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.651" offset="2077968">We must emphasize that contrary to what the respondents would have the Court believe, reasonable variations do not mean shortages below the lot average.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.067" offset="2143692">This warning was clearly set out in handbook 67, published by the National Bureau of Standards of the Department of Commerce and handbook 67 states that this is the basic requirement of the National Conference of Weights and Measures and of the Food and Drug Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.697" offset="2230209">We would submit to this Court that the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit made three basic errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.449" offset="2261138">To the extent the time permits, I will discuss one of the errors and Mr. Goodman will discuss the other two.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.709" offset="2298232">The first one or the first error is the determination by the court with regard to the time when accuracy of weights and measures is to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.050" offset="2363538">The second error is in the court’s interpretation of the concurrent jurisdiction provisions in Section 408 of the Wholesome Meat Act which maybe found in Title XXI, Section 678.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.566" offset="2421635">And thirdly, the error by the court in its interpretation of the provisions of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act insofar as it related to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.852" offset="2486732">In this connection I refer specifically to Title XVI, Section 1461.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="601.535" offset="2509511">Each of these errors Mr. Kier, I take it is in the context of the same that the Ninth Circuit was wrong in saying there was preemption?</text>

          <turn speaker="loyal_e_keir" startTime="608.618" stopTime="724.131">
            <label>Mr. Loyal E. Keir</label>
            <text syncTime="608.618" offset="2537827">That is correct Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.699" offset="2546186">All three of these errors deal strictly with the issue of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.000" offset="2571368">I go now to the first error which we assert was committed by the Ninth Circuit, and that is in its determination as to the time when accuracy of weights and measures is to be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.188" offset="2640123">And that is according to the Ninth Circuit is the time of packaging of the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.457" offset="2665200">The Solicitor General in his amicus curiae brief filed with this Court agrees with the Ninth Circuit that time of packaging is the key time.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.638" offset="2713893">Interestingly enough, however, the respondents contrary to the Ninth Circuit and the Solicitor General maintain that the proper time for determining accuracy is the time of shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.735" offset="2774288">Petitioner contends that the state standard is the time of sale to the consumer, that this is the only correct standard and it is the only standard that can be correctly identified with the interest of the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.207" offset="2872195">Surely, we would be hard pressed to find even one consumer who -- when he picks up a food package in the supermarket and looks at the label, would think to himself that this label speaks as of the date of packaging or as the date of shipment from some distant shipping point.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.357" offset="2952756">The natural thing for a consumer to think to himself when he examines the package and looks at the label is that the label speaks to me now.</text>

            <text syncTime="728.371" offset="3016808">You say this -- the proper view is that the state requirement speaks that the time of sale to the consumer?</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan J. Goodman</label>
            <text syncTime="1038.986" offset="4259297">Federal -- the Ninth Circuit decision holds that the standard is true weight at the time of shipment from the packaging plant, but that and that reasonable variations are allowed thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.732" offset="4306317">Our principle contention on this point is that the phrase “reasonable variations” has been misconstrued by the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.526" offset="4337455">For example, we know and this Court will of course recall its own decisions which say that the purpose of three federal statutes at issue here; Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act and Wholesome Meat Act are all -- the language of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act to provide consumers with accurate information as to the quantity of contents and other statements on package label.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.129" offset="4427839">Secondly, there is a decision of the Second Circuit, United States versus Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company, 92 F.2nd 610 in which the State Inspector found a prints of butter, one pound packages of butter to contain less product than stated on the label at the retail store.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.056" offset="4507564">In affirming the District Court’s conviction of Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company for misbranding, the Second Circuit said and I quote “there can be no dispute that the underweight prints of butter were misbranded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.493" offset="4553331">Specifically focusing upon the reasonable variations language in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.035" offset="4575483">Let's consider the analogous statute the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.702" offset="4598157">That Act provides as to the two of three acts here in questions; The Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Wholesome Meat Act that the Secretary shall require true weight provided that reasonable variations maybe permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.669" offset="4654059">Pursuant to that statutory command, first, the Secretary of Agriculture and later the Environmental Protection Administration, both require that some packages maybe over and under so long as the retail packages are of full weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.612" offset="4717798">Thus In that case as the court may recall from looking at the briefs, the Insecticide Act is true weight for packaged poisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.048" offset="4767535">There should be no reason why the statute at issue in this case which is the same language should permit short weight in food products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.088" offset="4803688">Let me turn now to the questions of preemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.572" offset="4813615">Thus the first step is, is there a conflict between the statutes?</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.422" offset="4829080">We have to deal with the three statutes in terms to the historical perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.244" offset="4848306">The first is Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act which as the court, I’m sure recognizes does not have any preempted language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.934" offset="4879130">So the question is in this Court for example in Campbell versus U.C. does this statute impermissibly conflict, does the California Law impermissibly conflict with the federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.365" offset="4916851">So our position is that it doesn’t because as I’ve just discussed the Federal Law requires true weighted retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.827" offset="4938689">Moreover, even if there is a conflict, prior decisions of this Court especially the decision of last term in Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company versus Cottrell specifically permit the states to have more stringent standards provided those standards are not discriminatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1226.802" offset="5010578">But is that the language that's important or controlling in this case or is it the language dealing with requiring information different from as between the Federal and State Standard?</text>

            <text syncTime="1244.010" offset="5079437">Mr. Chief Justice, I think Your Honor as referring now to Section 408 of Wholesome Meat Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.869" offset="5102843">Let me proceed directly to that point and discuss both the point and 1461 of 15 U.S.C which is the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act Standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.699" offset="5142131">The language in Section 678 of 21 U.S.C or Section 408 of Wholesome Meat Act only prescribes that states may not have marking and labeling packaging or in grit requirements which are in addition to our different standard under the Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.458" offset="5205243">However, in the same sentence, later in the same clause, it gives the states concurrent jurisdiction to enforce adulteration and misbranding requirements and the standard to the met as so long as the state requirements for adulteration and misbranding are consistent with the requirements under the Wholesome Meat Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.389" offset="5300955">And thus, the only standard which the state must follow, which the states must follow on the Wholesome Meat Act is the same as under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.237" offset="5336273">What Congress said, marking, packaging, labeling an ingredients are preempted, but misbranding is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.411" offset="5365008">Now contrary to respondent’s assertion and contrary to the assertion for example in the amicus brief filed by the National Independent Meat Pack Association, there is a distinction between labeling and misbranding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.842" offset="5414745">What NIMPA argues in its amicus brief is that the term of labeling has swallowed up the term misbranding and is almost direct quote “labeling includes misbranding.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.038" offset="5451525">But if that is the case, then how do respondents and respondent’s amici solve the problem of misbranding including definitions of things other than labeling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.789" offset="5494575">For example, 601 and 5 of 21 U.S.C -- 601 and of 21 U.S.C. also says that package is misbranded if its deceptively filled, that is clearly not a labeling requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.043" offset="5539506">So, there is a distinction between labeling and branding, something that we discuss in further detail in our brief and that same distinction applies to 15 U.S.C.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.566" offset="5577644">Section 1461 under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.988" offset="5599274">Finally, let me respond the question which was asked before is preemption the only grounds upon which we are to reversal?</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.182" offset="5624142">The answer to that is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.266" offset="5632397">Assuming that Federal Law does not require accuracy a time of retail sale and assuming that this Court would otherwise or thereby hold that there is an impermissible conflict between the State and Federal Laws, it is amici’s contention that this Court’s decision last June after we filed our amicus brief, the National League of Cities versus Usery still compels reversal of the Ninth Circuit's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.250" offset="5732394">The Ninth Circuit's reasoning is that the states may not exercise our sovereign police power to protect our business and consumer purchasers against deception in the sale of food product.</text>

            <text syncTime="1525.199" offset="6204165">Let me return then to Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company versus Cottrell in which the Court again held that the State of Mississippi could enforce it’s own more stringent laws with respect to the adulteration of milk products and let’s discuss the respondent’s argument in this case in light of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.171" offset="6288071">We know that in the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and in the Wholesome Meat Act the terms adulteration and misbranding are statutorily linked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.734" offset="6326314">Thus in Section 408 of Wholesome Meat Act, it says that states may enforce adulteration or misbranding requirements so long as they are consistent with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.336" offset="6360691">The respondent’s contention is that they cannot be held accountable for the standard of the product, the quality of the product, the contents of the product at the time it leaves the shipping dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.933" offset="6415130">What that means is that applies not only to net weight which was the question presented in this case, but to bacteriological standards as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.927" offset="6447104">And thus, if they cannot be required to have true weight at retail, then can they be required that wholesomeness of retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.088" offset="6475734">We submit to answer that question is all three federal statutes, excuse me, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and Wholesome Meat Act require wholesomeness at retail as well the issue in this case turns on a question of whether we are going to revert to a standard of wholesomeness when packed as opposed to wholesomeness at retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.569" offset="6545638">Thus, under the language of ANP versus Cottrell, the state has a concern, an interest, a need to require true weight and wholesomeness retail and moreover so does the federal government and that is why the three federal statutes must be interpreted as requiring true weighted retail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1674.782" offset="6802474">One of the statements in handbook 67, one of the conclusions of the author that would by the National Bureau of Standards is that the present packaging practice is for packagers to overfill between 70% to 90% of their product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.786" offset="6854510">That appears in the handbook which has been lodged on page 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.858" offset="6874781">The present packaging practice of industry is to over pack.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.397" offset="6892962">In conclusion, we contend that for each of the reasons set fourth in our brief and as discussed today with certain gravity that Ninth Circuit decision ought not to be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.664" offset="6942072">What respondent seek is a rule that short weight by their interpretation of the reasonable variations provision that short weight packages must remain on sale and that overweight packages must be removed from sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.515" offset="6993481">And thus the Ninth Circuit held that one of the reason why the State Law was less stringent than the Federal Law was because we did not require enforcement action against overweight packages and it’s our contention and set forth more fully in our brief that that simply doesn’t make good enforcement sense, it is very expensive to the packer that doesn’t do anyone, any good.</text>
