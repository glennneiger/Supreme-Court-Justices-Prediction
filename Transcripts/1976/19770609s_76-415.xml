            <text syncTime="9.453" offset="138247">That State sustained the constitutionality of the state obscenity law against claims that the law did not comply with the requirements of this Court's decision several years ago in Miller against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.195" offset="209300">We granted -- we noted probable jurisdiction because -- because the -- the decision was in conflict with a decision of the federal three-judge court which had invalidated the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.419" offset="278159">We affirmed, we agree with the Illinois Supreme Court that the statute is consistent with Miller.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.879" offset="307938">We don't think it's either vague or overbroad, so we do affirmed with the judgment.</text>
