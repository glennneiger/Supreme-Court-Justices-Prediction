            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100538">We will hear arguments next in 75-1344, Scarborough against the United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip J. Hirschkop</label>
            <text syncTime="61.720" offset="347343">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.768" offset="359568">The issue before the court is a rather narrow one here, with very little history or caseload to really draw upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.038" offset="392587">The court had the issue before it somewhat in the Bass Case, United States v. Bass, but not precisely, the question raised here which is an extension of Bass.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.310" offset="433756">In Bass, however, the court reviewed the legislative history, as much as there is of it, and concluded the legislative history is of no great force and effect in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.201" offset="485269">I think we have to start again at that touchdown, accepting Bass what it stands for, although it was four members of the court who went as far as I would ask the court to go on this case, and five who went as far as the interpretation that you have to have an interstate commerce nexus for possession whether it be current or not was not reached by the fifth member.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.718" offset="603343">In the legislative history, we only have really the comments of the senator who proposed this amendment, Senator Long.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.649" offset="635108">In fact, three other senators spoke on legislative debate: Senator Domenici, Senator Dodd, and Senator McClellan, each of those three expressed reservations as the amendment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.256" offset="689547">Senator Domenici said “perhaps it has gone too far, we can try and work it out in conference."</text>
            <text syncTime="152.984" offset="712430">Senator Dodd, who drafted Title IV in the Section 922 corresponding statute, said he was uneasy about it but that they would study it Senator McClellan said it requires further thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.722" offset="771362">He said he would try to understand it, but he agreed with Senator Domenici that it may go too far.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.394" offset="794037">It is hard to say what they were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.041" offset="804695">Looking at Senator Long, it is very clear what he had in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.885" offset="820055">He wanted to stop felons, and I will deal only with the felon section of the statute since that is what this case covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.133" offset="845028">He wanted to stop felons from having guns where they can engage in further crime having previously demonstrated that propensity.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.627" offset="882958">Justice Blackmun, in a dissent in Bass, goes to that language in very plain language.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.101" offset="904900">But the majority in the Bass Case points out that all through there is interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.631" offset="931023">In 922, they are requiring interstate commerce in both the receiving and transporting sections, g and h.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.256" offset="957459">In 1202, they site clearly interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.182" offset="981178">The court pursuing that held in Bass that there had to be an interstate commerce nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.529" offset="1002598">It is interesting though in Senator Long’s comments in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.586" offset="1026840">He says you could own but not possess a weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.508" offset="1042514">Then in discussing the possession of a weapon, he goes on further and says very clearly “you should not possess it.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.199" offset="1069263">He does not want criminals to have guns.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.246" offset="1081488">But, he uses interchangeably a number of times the words “acquire” with “possess” and “taking” with “possess.”</text>
            <text syncTime="253.993" offset="1116492">He says this amendment does not seek to do anything about who owns a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.329" offset="1137808">He was concerned with the complaints about Title IV, the Dodd Bill, at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.814" offset="1167692">In Bass, the court quotes the statements of Congressman Pollack has very, very small debate in the House of Representatives on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.834" offset="1211787">Congressman Pollack says one who takes, possess, or receives a firearm across state lines and then has a number of other statements sited in a brief for the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.773" offset="1255568">What we are left with is a statute with literally no legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.774" offset="1271555">Only the comments of Senator Long which are contradictory in places, although his intent is clear, but it is only his intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.446" offset="1310321">He never, however, expresses clearly the intent whether it must in fact be that interstate nexus required in the Bass Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.802" offset="1347728">So the court, then, has to look where to go with the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.351" offset="1373851">I would suggest to the court, the place we have to go to the Barrett decision of this court in 1976 which is very interesting in its scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.225" offset="1413348">In Barrett, it is a 922 case and it does go to a case concerning receiving a firearm that has traveled in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.351" offset="1449919">Justice Blackmun in the majority opinion in Barrett points out that you must look to the specific language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.950" offset="1484296">Now Barrett is a case on 922 whether is a good deal of legislative history where there were reports from the Congress, there were extensive debates from the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.346" offset="1521913">There was much that could be looked at.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.520" offset="1530585">But, Barrett was quoting Justice Blackmun as couched in the present-perfect tense.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.040" offset="1552633">It sited a gun that has traveled in interstate commerce or has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, it’s the exact language.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.734" offset="1599444">Justice Blackmun, looking at it there, writing for the majority, said “you must look at exactly what they meant by the tense itself.”</text>
            <text syncTime="382.640" offset="1631000">Now there was discussion between the majority and dissenting views in Bass as to where comments were placed.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.155" offset="1661093">I suggest the court that given the legislative history of the lack of it in the Bass case, you can draw no inferences for any comments or lack of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.089" offset="1696829">But in Barrett, very precisely, the court says, we must look at the tense used, we must look at what legislature ended up saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.851" offset="1727862">That is particularly pertinent in 1202 with no legislative history to draw upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.265" offset="1749596">You must look at what they said and deal with what they said or take upon yourselves the tour of legislating.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.338" offset="1781883">They pointed out in the Barrett Case, Section 922(k), Justice Blackmun points it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.184" offset="1809260">He uses the words “in commerce” and that is the same language that’s used in Section 1202, the section before the court now.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.116" offset="1844995">Justice Blackmun points out there is no lenity required in examining Section 922, because there are no ambiguities as there were in Section 1202 as pointed out in Bass.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.332" offset="1893792">He further points out there was, of course, a great deal of legislative history, but points out interestingly enough that the legislative history pointed in Section 922 similar to that small amount of history on Section 1202 that they want to prevent possession by criminals of handguns.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.005" offset="1976548">The scope of who has them is different between the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.062" offset="1996714">The people under indictment are included in 922 and 1202 has to be people convicted of a felony aside from other classes of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.832" offset="2035794">But what is clear between the two is congress, in both, had an interstate commerce requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.871" offset="2064006">It is in both statutes and it is a question of how the court will apply that.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.123" offset="2076962">The sole question, as I see in this case, is what is the degree of nexus?</text>
            <text syncTime="500.856" offset="2103921">Can it be current or must it be current?</text>
            <text syncTime="503.840" offset="2115833">Can it be past or must it be any nexus?</text>
            <text syncTime="507.029" offset="2128580">You approached this in the Rewis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.731" offset="2135372">Now, Rewis was not a gun case, it was an interstate gambling case under the Travel Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.369" offset="2161913">But there, you approached the problem of what is the degree of nexus required?</text>
            <text syncTime="520.025" offset="2180616">How much interstate commerce must there be or what degree of interstate commerce must it be for it to be a violation of law?</text>
            <text syncTime="529.314" offset="2217710">When you look at the two acts, the 1202 Act is very precisely in current and present tense.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.988" offset="2248430">“One who receives, possesses, or transports in commerce, or affecting commerce.”</text>
            <text syncTime="543.354" offset="2273926">It’s nothing past in it as opposed to 922, as I read a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.235" offset="2297436">“Receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.”</text>
            <text syncTime="556.109" offset="2324917">The 922 does not have a proscription against possession, but the language on interstate commerce between the two is very instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.556" offset="2362742">I suggest to the court, the only place you can look for an interpretation of 1202 is the language itself and, as you pointed out in Barrett, you must look clearly at the tense used and take that for what Congress meant in the absence of anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.161" offset="2429093">In the Bass Case, the Court pointed out that Title VII was not carefully molded to complement Title IV.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.796" offset="2467650">In fact, Title VII may be one of the worst examples of legislation in terms of careful consideration on the Congress’s behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.410" offset="2514148">It was brought to the floor and read, a week later, it was brought to the floor and read again.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.073" offset="2536822">During the first week only comments were made by Senator Long.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.374" offset="2553958">During the second week, Senator Long made comments again.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.566" offset="2566706">He had a couple of questions from the three other senators and then, it was supposed to go to conference but, for some reason, not clear in the Congressional record, it was immediately voted off and passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.394" offset="2622086">In Bass, the majority opinion by four justices goes farther than just saying there must be a nexus.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.371" offset="2662001">It suggests there is a difference between possession and receipt offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.927" offset="2684153">This goes on to state very clearly that more is required for possession offense and this has been treated by the government in their brief as pure dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.102" offset="2736920">I do not know if there is such a thing as pure dictum in the opinion of the United States, Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.464" offset="2758340">In the Second Circuit, the Bell decision, as in the United States versus Bell, which came down late 1975, they treated that.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.891" offset="2800032">They followed the particular position we ask the court to follow in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.199" offset="2817273">They took the totally opposite view of the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.562" offset="2830752">But there, they sited the difference between what they call obiter dictum and judicial dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.870" offset="2851963">They pointed out that the language in Bass was not just judges speculating about something but a specific problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.713" offset="2891356">It was a problem that was present in Bass while not directly considered by the court in the opinion, not expressly considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.050" offset="2920718">The court had to inherently consider because the court dismisses Bass, dismisses the indictment eventually saying there is no interstate nexus demonstrate in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.043" offset="2968678">The court recognizes, inherently in there, they would have to be an interstate nexus shown to reach a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.713" offset="3003369">The question of whether it needs to be current or past nexus would be inherent in that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1313.711" offset="5355330">The only thing, I bring to the court’s attention is the fact that the Courts of Appeals, in variously considering the Bass Case, have some of them taken independent views and support of the Bass Case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1333.803" offset="5435682">Walker in the Seventh Circuit gives some support to it also -- In fact, in the Walker Case, in a footnote there, the court points out that a federal prosecution of the state offenses historically must be expressly authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.267" offset="5517602">That is one of the underlying major problems in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.109" offset="5532962">It is an offense that many, many states specifically deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.628" offset="5558980">To disregard an interstate commerce nexus would intrude much on the province on the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.962" offset="5592313">As the Courts point out, several of the Courts of Appeals, the Walker Court, the Bell Court, as this court has pointed out in Bass and Barrett, before such an intrusion is made by the federal judiciary and the federal legislature, there should be a very specific intent expressed by the federal legislature to make such an intrusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="2113.741" offset="8555434">Let me give you the following example which occurs not infrequently in prosecution cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2119.687" offset="8579258">For instance, suppose a fellow committed a felony and was convicted for a felony in 1970.</text>

            <text syncTime="2154.096" offset="8716871">Although those facts would demonstrate conclusively that the individual had received the firearm after his felony conviction and after the statute and therefore was clearly in violation of Section 922 of Title IV, the government may often not be able to prove where he received that weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.084" offset="8812793">Since venue is a fact to be proved, the individual could not be prosecuted for that case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="2277.788" offset="9211630">But, I believe that Congress did not want to have to demonstrate in each case that a dangerous person who was in possession of a firearm was actually moving across the state line, that, it seems to me, as a wholly unnecessary matter of proof and certainly one that is not required by the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2299.721" offset="9299402">Our construction of the scope of Section 1202 is based primarily on three considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.712" offset="9323330">First of all, the language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.486" offset="9330435">Second of all, the relationship of Section 1202 with the entire scheme of Federal Gun Control Legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.998" offset="9356453">Third, the legislative history of Section 1202 which, not withstanding Mr. Hershkoff’s contention, we submit unmistakably demonstrates that Congress intended the broadest possible scope to this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.694" offset="9419251">Section 1202, by its terms, prohibits any convicted felon and other class of certain categories of dangerous individuals from “punishes anyone who receives, possesses, or transports in commerce or affecting commerce any firearm.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.221" offset="9497410">The phrase “in commerce or affecting commerce” is admittedly not as clear as the statutory language in Section 922, which this court construed in United States versus Barrett, which makes it unlawful for convicted felons or certain other persons ”to receive any firearm or ammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.343" offset="9585808">Nevertheless, to the extent that the statutory language in Section 1202(a) is a guide, we submit that it points clearly to our construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.832" offset="9623842">First, the phrase “affecting commerce,” which Mr. Hershkoff had largely ignored but which is also in Section 1202, is essentially a statutory term of art.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.214" offset="9665325">As we pointed out in our brief, this court has recognized the distinction between legislation limited to activities in commerce and an assertion of Congress’s full commerce power so as to cover all activity substantially affecting interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.729" offset="9727392">Congress has used the phrase “affect commerce or affecting commerce” in a number of statutes which have been interpreted to reach transactions involving products after they have come to rest with interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.192" offset="9777234">The Civil Rights Act is one example that is particularly instructive to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.813" offset="9803774">In 42 USC Section 2000(a)(c), the Civil Rights Act defines “operations affecting commerce.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.888" offset="9852048">To include establishments, a substantial portion of whose product “has moved in commerce.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.350" offset="9877857">A particular significance of that statute for this case lies in the fact that Senator Long, the sponsor of Section 1202, made specific reference in the legislative history of Section 1202 to the Civil Rights Act and this court’s decisions upholding the power of Congress, in Senator Long’s words, “to regulate matters affecting commerce, not just to regulate interstate commerce itself.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.877" offset="9984019">Furthermore, if Congress had wanted to limit the offenses set forth in Section 1202 to conduct contemporaneous with the movement in interstate commerce, it clearly could have and would have used language employed elsewhere in both the Gun Control Statute and other federal statutes which indicate such a limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.886" offset="10056012">For example, Section 922(j) of Title IV of the Gun Control Act makes it unlawful knowingly to receive, conceal, or sell a stolen firearm “which is moving as, which is a part of, or which constitutes interstate or foreign commerce.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.887" offset="10128006">The language in Section 1202, we submit is quite more broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.223" offset="10149426">It relates not only to firearms that are in commerce, but those that are affecting commerce as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.605" offset="10174922">In fact, the construe of Section 1202(a), as petitioner would construe it, would be to read the term “affecting commerce” out of the statute all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.935" offset="10228211">Apart from the statutory language, the relationship of Section 1202 to the entire scheme of Federal Gun Control Legislation indicates that the possession offense includes possession of firearms that have previously traveled in interstate commerce and is not limited to possession of firearms contemporaneous with interstate commerce movement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.014" offset="10308564">As I mentioned at the outset, this court in Barrett recognized that the entire structure of the Gun Control Act demonstrates that congress sought broadly to keep firearms away from the persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.695" offset="10351300">Congress classified as potentially dangerous and irresponsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.522" offset="10366556">Section 922(h) of Title IV prohibits convicted felon of receiving a firearm after his felony conviction or and an after the date of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.043" offset="10412636">As this Court indicated in United States v. Bass, the receipt offense in Section 1202 has the same scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.175" offset="10441162">The only effect of adapting petitioner’s construction to this statute would be the convicted felons would continue to be prohibited under Section 922 from acquiring new firearms after their felony conviction but would permit convicted felons to keep old firearms that they had acquired before their felony conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.364" offset="10533949">Furthermore, as I have mentioned, even convicted felons who received firearms after their felony convictions could not be prosecuted under petitioner’s construction, if there was no way of proving when or where they had acquired those firearms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2625.071" offset="10600822">Not only would that create an enormous loophole in the scheme of the Federal Gun Control Statute, but there is no conceivable reason why Congress would have intended such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.924" offset="10660172">The act of receiving a firearm has no inherently greater connection to interstate commerce than the act of possessing a firearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.182" offset="10693191">A convicted felon may receive a firearm long after that firearm has come to rest in the state where he receives it and he would still be guilty under petitioner’s construction of violating both Section 922 and Section 1202(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.321" offset="10757766">The act of receiving the weapon has no closer nexus to interstate commerce than the act of possessing the weapon which necessarily follows immediately after the receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.091" offset="10804891">Furthermore, receipt is a term that encompasses conduct that goes far beyond any commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.233" offset="10833416">You can receive a weapon by gift or by stealing, it has nothing to do with commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2695.970" offset="10884407">In short, there is no basis for concluding that Congress would have intended to make a distinction between the proof required to show a nexus between the firearm and interstate commerce for purposes of the receipt offense and the proof that was necessary for the possession offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.641" offset="10955042">Certainly, that there is no basis in the language of the statute for such a distinction, since the phrase “in commerce or affecting commerce” modifies both the offense of receiving and possession in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.223" offset="11017423">Perhaps the most important consideration in terms of the statutory scheme is that petitioner’s construction would, in effect, read the term possession completely out of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.744" offset="11411454">It is our primary contention that the term “in commerce or affecting commerce” encompasses a possession of any firearm that has had some previous movement in interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="2903.109" offset="11712907">The legislative history of this statute, it seems to me, more than anything perhaps demonstrates that congress was intending to prohibit the possession of firearms by felons as broadly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.496" offset="11790438">This court in Bass concluded not unreasonably that that history was not so clear as to demonstrate that there was no necessity for any showing in each case of any nexus whatsoever between a firearm and interstate commerce, particularly in view of this fact that the statute had language that specifically made reference to interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.754" offset="11875493">But beyond that, since these firearms here have been proven to have had a nexus with interstate commerce, it seems to me that the legislative history is quite clear that Congress wanted to prohibit possession as broadly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.402" offset="11954069">Indeed, every word of the legislative history or every sentence reflects a concern with possession, not simply as Mr. Hershkoff had suggested ownership or acquisition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.641" offset="11999000">Possession was obviously what Congress was after.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.915" offset="12020107">In summary, Your Honor, petitioner’s construction is completely at odds with the language of Section 1202.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.986" offset="12064411">The purpose of Section 1202 is reflected in the entire statutory scheme, and the legislative history of Section 1202.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.490" offset="12094399">Its construction would create an enormous loophole in the statute and a loophole which would frustrate Congress’ primary purpose in enacting this entire Gun Control Legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3021.961" offset="12188336">Your Honor, on the question of petitioner’s construction with regard to a weapon that has not yet come to rest, I suggest the court, it is only the way you can harmonize the Bass and Barrett decisions with any present position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.047" offset="12252701">It was raised in and the reason I took the by the position taken by then, Judge Stevens, in the Walker Case, we express surprise on the scope of receipt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.250" offset="12297527">If you limit the interstate commerce nexus to a present nexus on possession, he says there, receipt may be too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.486" offset="12334412">What is inherent, I think, in Justice Marshall’s opinion in Bass is that if a gun is still moving, once having started interstate commerce, interstate commerce will flow until the gun comes to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.990" offset="12384463">So, receipt goes farther than possession does, it is the only way I think you could differentiate the two, and I believe we did that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3104.466" offset="12518314">No one knows what the jury did, they had four weapons before, but that is the problem with the stock that Justice Powell raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.302" offset="12541720">The fact that the evidence in the case was that that weapon had been given to his father to sell prior to the time of this conviction, and he had gotten that part just for his father.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.244" offset="12589472">But, you get a de minimis connection because if someone buys bullets, does that make the weapon an interstate commerce or a scope or a side or cleaning oil or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.714" offset="12627297">I can only suggest in closing that in Bass, Justice Marshall quotes Justice Homes in a case, in which he cites the Footnote 15, that when people go out to buy guns, there’s difference of people going out to commit murder, they look for guidance very often in statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.908" offset="12700127">The evidence in this case was that this petitioner looked for guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.408" offset="12718099">He spoke to the police and he spoke to council about the ability to keep those guns at his house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.767" offset="12735549">He was advised he could do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.225" offset="12741400">It is precisely what Justice Homes suggested that people will look for guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.949" offset="12764283">The guidance was there in the Bass Case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3168.430" offset="12774210">It is not petitioner’s construction which government takes issue, it is the construction of four justices of this court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3175.266" offset="12801586">Well, Mr. Hirschkop, perhaps the moral to be drawn from this dilemma that is posed is that when a man is indicted for a felony, he perhaps better divest himself of firearms that come under the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3193.240" offset="12873475">That might be a harsh moral, Your Honor, because conviction of a felony carries within a number of proscriptions, of rights of citizenship, and if we give full credence to your innocence and proven guilty, you have a right to maintain your rights of citizenship until such time as the court says you are guilty.</text>
