            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100523">We will hear arguments next in 76-128, Mandel, Governor of Maryland against Bradley.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.933" offset="276170">Mr. Nilson, you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. George A. Nilson</label>
            <text syncTime="46.688" offset="287246">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.946" offset="296232">My name is George Nilson; I am a Deputy Attorney General for the State of Maryland and I am here on behalf of the appellants to argue in favor of the constitutionality of Maryland’s filing deadline for independent candidates seeking a place on Maryland’s general election ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.717" offset="351299">Appellee, Bruce Bradley, an unsuccessful independent candidate for the United States Senate and his supporters, contend that the deadline is so far ahead of the election that it infringes on their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.751" offset="403439">The Three-Judge Court below agreed feeling bound by this Court’s summary affirmance of the Three-Judge Court decision in Salera versus Tucker out of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.960" offset="440324">As in most other states, the bulk of the candidates who appear on Maryland’s general election ballot, do so as a consequence of their success in the party primary elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.232" offset="473447">Primary elections are held by each political party with which 10% or more of the state's registered voters are affiliated.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.662" offset="499152">Other candidates who wish to have their names appear on the general election ballot must file nominating petitions in accordance with the requirements set fourth in Section 7-1 of Article 33 of the Maryland Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.064" offset="544709">Those requirements can be summarized as follows: First, the petitions must be signed by 3% of the registered voters eligible to vote for the office in question, determined as four months prior to the primary election.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.910" offset="596118">Second, and this is the element upon which the court below focused, the nominating petitions must be filed by the same date on which party primary candidates must file their certificates of candidacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.991" offset="640422">That is 70 days before the primary election.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.010" offset="652543">This results in an early March deadline in presidential election years when the primaries are held in May, and in early July deadline in other years when the primaries are held in September.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.541" offset="698623">Next, the nominating petitions maybe circulated and signed at any time prior to the deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.510" offset="722551">There is no gathering period restriction like those which have been present in other cases in this area previously considered by this Court, nor is there a gathering period restriction similar to the one that was present in the Salera case.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.625" offset="778975">Next, persons who wish to vote in the primary election or not prohibited from doing so are having signed a nominating petition on behalf of an independent candidate, and petitions signers need not state their intention to vote for the candidate whose petition they signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.358" offset="837907">And finally, unlike the case and the situation in some other states petitions maybe circulated by non-residence and person is not registered in Maryland and the individual voters signatures need not be no notarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.511" offset="886495">The challenge in this case and the opinion of lower court which we seek to reverse, focused entirely on a filling deadline of 70 days before the primary election, and particularly on that deadline as it operates in a presidential election year where it occurs in early March.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.817" offset="947726">In this case on the March 8, 1976 deadline established by the Maryland statute, Mr. Bradley filed a number of signatures which, if they had all been valid signatures of registered voters, would have been sufficient to satisfy Maryland’s 3% requirement within the statutory deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.975" offset="1012405">However more than 20% of those signatures proved to be invalid and when Mr. Bradley was left in outer place on the Maryland ballot, he filed suit in the United States District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.285" offset="1049604">He argued below and he argues to this Court that Maryland’s early filing deadline, as he characterizes it, denies an equal protection of the laws and unreasonably infringes upon his First Amendment rights and those of the voters who would support him.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.613" offset="1102894">He succeeded in persuading the Three-Judge Court below that Maryland’s deadline falls too far in advance of the general election and lacks sufficient supporting state interest, and therefore infringes upon his constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.414" offset="1154094">In essence, he persuaded the lower court that its decision in this case was controlled, absolutely controlled by the decision of the Three-Judge Court in the Pennsylvania case of Salera versus Tucker which was similarly affirmed by this Court earlier this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.667" offset="1211145">Based upon its reading of the summary affirmance in Salera v. Tucker the Three-Judge Court below granted Mr. Bradley injunctive and declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.138" offset="1249075">With the benefit of the additional time allowed him by the lower court he went on to become a candidate albeit an unsuccessful one in the general election of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.603" offset="1286900">This appeal followed the granting of relief by the lower court and this Court noted probable jurisdiction in October.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.317" offset="1313754">While the case is now before the Court for plenary consideration on its merits and while this Court thus need not concern itself with the significance of its prior summary affirmances to quite the degree as lower courts must.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.214" offset="1365372">We have argued in our briefs that the lower court here substantially must apply the teachings of Hicks versus Miranda and its progeny with respect to the significance of prior summary dispositions by the Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="334.219" offset="1437365">That is correct it did, but I believe the Tully case subsequent to Hicks versus Miranda strongly indicate, if not clearly holds, that summary affirmances from Three-Judge Court decision would be treated the same way and accorded the same weight that --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="351.334" offset="1505806">It was not with respect to summary affirmance, wasn’t it?</text>
            <text syncTime="354.632" offset="1518972">When Hicks against Miranda, the new ground it broke, if it was new ground, had to do with dismissals for one of his substantial federal question, wasn’t it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="george_a_nilson" startTime="364.653" stopTime="531.729">
            <label>Mr. George A. Nilson</label>
            <text syncTime="364.653" offset="1559096">That is correct, but I do not believe prior to Hicks versus Miranda, it had been clearly established just what the import of summary affirmances was either, and I think even after Hicks versus Miranda there were some commentators who argued that there was still a distinction and that perhaps summary affirmances were not entitled quite as much weight as the Hicks kind of summary disposition, but I think that the Tully decision of this Court places the two equal footing.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.038" offset="1664631">The lower court, we submit, the error that it made was to adopt a particular reading of the lower court’s decision in Salera v. Tucker, and assume that this Court summarily affirm the decision in that case, in the Salera case on precisely the same analytical grounds which the court below thought what had been applied by the lower court in Salera.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.163" offset="1757104">The Pennsylvania statutory scheme death within Salera, required independent candidates to gather their nominating petition signatures within a three week period ending 49 days before the primary election and either 218 or 244 days before the general election depending upon whether it was a presidential election year or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.952" offset="1836307">The Salera Court felt ban to uphold the three week gathering period in light of the opinion of this Court in Storer versus Brown, upholding on its face, a 24-day gathering period in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.647" offset="1891060">I would submit that the Salera court was wrong in that respect, particularly and so far as it examined the gathering period by itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.586" offset="1926796">Having thus upheld, that short gathering period, feeling compelled to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.446" offset="1946231">The Salera court then went on to invalidate the Pennsylvania requirement with signature gathering staff and all petitions be filed 49 days before the primary election.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.634" offset="1986982">The lower court here chose to read Salera as treating these two requirements gathering period and deadline as separate and distinct from one another, and assumed that this Court likewise view them a separate and distinct in summarily affirming.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.151" offset="2045078">We would submit that such a reading of Salera is not correct and would be clearly contrary the analytical approach established for these kinds of constitutional questions by this Court’s written opinions in Williams versus Rhodes, Jenness versus Fortson, American Party of Texas versus white and Storer versus Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.879" offset="2119997">We believe that the jurisdictional statement in Salera then as it was properly presented to this Court, the question of whether a three week signature gathering period in conjunction with an early deadline was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.921" offset="2176108">We further submit that the proper way to read this Court’s summary affirmance in Salera is as a holding of the combination of such a limited signature gathering period and an early filing deadline is unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="547.194" offset="2289271">Prior to the lunch and break I was discussing Salera versus Tucker in the summary affirmance, and had noted that the jurisdictional statement in that case then as it was had properly presented to this Court, the question of whether a three week signature gathering period taken in conjunction with an early deadline was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.010" offset="2364503">We further submit that the proper way to read this Court’s summary affirmance in Salera is as a holding that the combination of such a limited signature gathering period and an early filing deadline is unconstitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="587.290" offset="2449663">However, such a result in no way compels or even suggests a conclusion of Maryland’s filing deadline unaccompanied as it is by any limitation on the period during which signatures might be gathered or by any other significant restriction is unconstitutional.</text>

            <label>Mr. George A. Nilson</label>
            <text syncTime="708.794" offset="2935645">But I think al least it is important to resolve the constitutional status by this Court now that we are here with respect to the filing deadline under Maryland law.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.841" offset="2979844">I might add that the lower court’s opinion added an element of uncertainly even beyond the particular holding in that case by indicating or suggesting that perhaps Mr. Bradley was entitled to even more relief than effectively a primary deadline in addition to the analysis of the lower court that was applied to our statute, raises serious questions even about the modification of the statute that Mr. Bradley has suggested in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.400" offset="3102097">An examination of the primary written opinions of this Court which control the outcome of this case, Williams versus Rhodes, Jenness versus Fortson, American party of Texas v. White and Storer v. Brown enable us to identify certain basic principles which were to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.673" offset="3167194">First, generally speaking where state ballot access laws are challenge they should be considered in their totality, and individual provisions at least where they interact with one another and relate to one another should not be singled out and treated in isolation.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.560" offset="3230724">The exception for an individual or single factor which does not interact as discussed in this Court’s opinion in Storer versus Brown and clearly is not applicable in the present situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.843" offset="3279834">Secondly, the First Amendment and equal protection analysis merged and in the context of requirements imposed upon independent candidates boil down to two related tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.705" offset="3319331">First, do ballot access requirements constitute -- and I am quoting from this Court’s prior opinions, “insurmountable obstacles” or “suffocating restrictions” which make it impossible or impractical for an independent to gain a place on the ballot or do they provide a feasible opportunity for reasonably diligent independents to run?</text>
            <text syncTime="824.648" offset="3399057">Secondly, do they promote a substantial imbalance in the relative difficulty for independents and primary candidates?</text>
            <text syncTime="832.304" offset="3429672">In other words are they inherently or invidiously more burdensome as to independents.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.050" offset="3448690">In resolving the issue of the substantiality or discriminatory nature of the ballot access requirements, this Court’s opinions instruct us to examine actual experience in the State in question as a principle guide.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.163" offset="3497173">Substantial burdens and discriminations maybe justified even if they exists if they serve compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.620" offset="3526952">If they are -- and again I am quoting form American party of Texas v. White, “reasonably imposed in pursuit of vital state objectives that can not be served equally well in significantly less burdensome ways.”</text>
            <text syncTime="868.838" offset="3575854">With respect to compelling interest this Court has established that the states have a compelling interest in preserving the integrity of the electoral process and regulating the number of candidates on the ballot to avoid undo voter confusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.113" offset="3620889">They are free to assure themselves that a candidate is a serious contender with a significant level of community support.</text>
            <text syncTime="887.088" offset="3648787">This Court’s opinions also established that it is a legitimate and compelling interest on party of the state to provide parody of treatment and fix identical deadlines for primary and independent candidates respectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.786" offset="3699570">And finally, it is clearly permissible to provide different routes to the printed ballot, so long as they are not substantially unequal in their difficultly.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.005" offset="3740530">In applying these principles this Court has only once invalidated a state ballot access regulatory scheme in a written opinion and that was Williams versus Rhodes where this Court invalidated the Ohio scheme calling for 15% of the voters to sign petitions on behalf of the parties by February 7th in the election year and required these parties, these lesser parties, to develop an extensive party organization and engage in other organizational activities prior to this February 7th deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.783" offset="3863619">Conversely in Storer versus Brown a 24-day gathering period was facially upheld, coupled with a 5% signature requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.813" offset="3899772">Although the case was remanded for reconsideration in light of the number of voters, the question involving the number of voters who would be disqualified from signing nominating petitions by their participation in primary elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.576" offset="3950763">In the American Party case a deadline of 120 days before general election was upheld, coupled with a 55-day gathering period and requirements as high as 5% depending on the office, together with a disqualification of primary voters from signing nominating petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.857" offset="4023906">And finally and perhaps most importantly, in Jenness versus Fortson a deadline of 69 days before the primary and 150 days before the general election was upheld, even though coupled with a 6-month gathering period and a 5% requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.331" offset="4085764">The Georgia Law, upheld in Jenness, was either the same as or more stringent than the Maryland Law here at issue in every single respect except that here the deadline occurs approximately three months earlier in a presidential election year, three months more prior to the general election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.159" offset="4161101">This Court’s summary affirmances of lower court decisions upholding ballot access restrictions are entirely consistent with these written opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.155" offset="4193075">In Socialist Labor Party versus Rhodes which was summarily affirmed by this Court is Sweetenham versus Gilligan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.814" offset="4215749">The issue was squarely presented to this Court as to the validity of what was then Ohio’s 9-month deadline, nine months before the general, 90 days before the primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.678" offset="4255142">That case was summarily affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.615" offset="4262979">In Pratt v. Begley, another summary affirmance where this Court was squarely presented with the issue of weather, of the validity of a 55-day pre-primary, 7-month pre-general deadline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.082" offset="4308850">Again Pratt v. Begley was summarily affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.641" offset="4323060">Jackson versus Ogilvie, also involving a pre-primary deadline and a 5% requirement, again similarly affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.327" offset="4353780">Auerbach versus Mandel, Maryland’s People Party versus Mandel and Wood v. Putterman, all dealing to one degree to another with the precise nominating requirements now before this Court with all three lower court opinions upholding the law in the early 70’s and being summarily affirmed by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.059" offset="4428699">Notwithstanding the lower court’s dismissal here of these three summary affirmances involving the precise same statute we are now presented with, we submit that those cases did raise the constitutional question now presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.966" offset="4480317">They were clearly posed in the jurisdictional statements, at least in Auerbach and Peoples Party, and Auerbach was later cited in Storer versus Brown at Footnote 10 as constituting a prior approval by this Court of Maryland’s 3% nominating requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.914" offset="4544161">Against disarray of authority the sole liberation is Salera versus Tucker as construed by the lower court here and the opinion of the lower court here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.586" offset="4578851">While we have no quarrel with the result in Salera, as I have indicated earlier, we believe its reasoning as perceived by the lower court was clearly wrong and inconsistent with the analytical framework previously established by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.881" offset="4632036">Never before has a filing deadline been stricken in isolation and standing by itself.</text>

            <label>Mr. George A. Nilson</label>
            <text syncTime="1145.873" offset="4683968">He was indeed familiar with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.222" offset="4689401">If he was not of course familiar with precisely, except in terms of reading the jurisdictional statement, with precisely what was presented to this Court and that the deliberations of this Court involved in dealing with Auerbach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.527" offset="4734541">But I think in examination of the opinion, even thought it may have been authored by Judge Winter, of the opinion in Auerbach and the papers presented to this Court reflect a clear presentation of the constitutional issue to this Court in Auerbach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.920" offset="4784174">I think our view of that is enhanced or supported by the citation of Auerbach as a case on the merits upholding the 3% requirement, and such a citation was made in Storer versus Brown in the written opinion of this Court in storer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.053" offset="4848644">In so far as Salera was relevant to the lower court here and is relevant to this Court now it should be viewed only a standing for the proposition that the combination of a limited 3-week gathering period and a relatively early filing deadline pose too substantial barrier to independent candidacies, and that this combination is not sufficiently supported by the state interest which were discussed in Salera, which were more limited than the ones presented here and discussed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.211" offset="4953343">Regardless of the alternative way in which one could read the lower court’s opinions in Salera, the view just described of the consequence of this Court’s summary affirmance here is the only way to avoid a fundamental conflict between the Salera case and this Court’s prior written opinions and summary affirmances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.972" offset="5024396">This Court’s opinion in Fusari versus Steinberg, as well as the Chief Justice’s concurring opinion in that case, dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Brennan in Colorado Springs Amusements, and the dissenting opinions of Mr. Justices Brennan and Marshall in Sidle versus Majors clearly indicate that the lower courts have an obligation to construe some re-affirmances in way in which to the extent possible day or consistent with one another and not contrary to this Court’s prior written decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.988" offset="5136409">That obligation was not fulfilled by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.651" offset="5163054">View it as a whole, the Maryland petition nominating system is substantially more liberal than that of many states and does not place insurmountable restrictions in the way of an independent candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.666" offset="5207148">I summarized the feature of our law at the beginning of our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.996" offset="5220419">It is summarized at Pages 23-24 of our brief, and I think does not merit further comment, again reemphasize that there is no limitation on the gathering period and there are no significant disqualification in terms of who may sing the petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.144" offset="5289068">We also submit that when viewed in relative terms, the record below indicates that there is no substantial imbalance as between the route available in Maryland to independent candidates and the route available to party primary candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.057" offset="5340686">When we turn to actual experience in Maryland as we are told by this Court’s decision we should, we find that independent candidates have qualified for a place on the ballot with sufficient regularity to indicate that the obstacles are not insurmountable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.466" offset="5394290">In 1974 the record demonstrates that eight candidates qualified for state legislative contest and in 1976 two candidates qualified for congressional contest by the March 8th deadline, and Mr. Bradley himself would have qualified but for the invalidation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.379" offset="5465970">Even if this Court should determine that the obstacles imposed are substantial either in absolute or relative terms and that the actual experience is not sufficient to indicate the feasibility of a reasonably diligent candidate’s qualifying, the statute must be upheld if it is based upon compelling state interest which can not be served equally well in significantly less burdensome ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.124" offset="5553010">There are significant and compelling state interests at stake here and they go beyond as I have indicated above those discussed in Salera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.039" offset="5588641">The prevention of frivolous and fraudulent independent candidacies, maturing only after the conclusion of the primary elections, has been recognized as a substantial interest, and I would submit it is furthered and enhanced by the filing deadline established under Maryland Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.667" offset="5651125">Related interest is the elimination of voter confusion caused by late-blooming candidacies, a consideration which maybe especially important in the presidential year when political activity is both, more intense and more long-lasting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.461" offset="5702325">The need to insure that both party primary candidates and independent candidates including those who obtained general election ballot access after all of the validation and primary election procedures are over, to insure that they are afforded relatively comparable treatment and that neither has given an unfair advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.337" offset="5773796">By establishing the same filing deadline and providing for a system at about the time of the primary election, the voters and all candidates will know who is going to be on the general election ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.849" offset="5827818">A system not requiring the filings to take place into on or after the primary election would leave up in the air, the status of independent candidates in terms of their position on the general election ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.261" offset="5869509">The fostering of public discussion of campaign issues among all candidates, when voter interest is at its peak during the primary election rather than allowing independent candidacies to remain embryonic or dormant until the primaries have ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.538" offset="5922590">The prevention or alleviation of the administrative problems that might surface at the petition verification process and likely challenges, such as this one, where telescoped into a shorter and later period time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.561" offset="5966685">And finally, the promotion of all of these interests while still preserving the right of Maryland voters to express themselves early in a presidential election year as to there choice for presidential nominees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.911" offset="6024154">The testimony of Professor Smucker (ph) which is summarized at Page 8-9 and 28-29 of our brief, indicate, I believe, and illustrate the fairness of the system and highlight the fact that independent candidates are not treated unfairly relative to primary candidates with respect to the earliness of the deadline and the contention that it hampers the independent candidate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.544" offset="6134600">I think it is well know of course to take the presidential primary elections as an example that the presidential primary has held in New Hampshire in February of the election year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.936" offset="6180262">If the decision below stands and if this kind of analysis stands, it is entirely conceivable that the next time around in a presidential election year someone will be arguing that it is unconstitutional to provide such an early primary in New Hampshire, which in fact even forces the candidates to be actively campaigning in the year prior to the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.710" offset="6271272">I think right now Mr. Bradley has contented in his brief in an argument below that it is unfair to make him sort before the period immediately preceding the primary on the theory, on the grounds that the primary election candidates are not required to start so early but only have to begin during those last 70 days before the primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.037" offset="6352670">That is not the way politics run, that is not the way elections are run.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.045" offset="6368657">In the State of Maryland now we have almost one article a day on the Gubernatorial Candidates for the 1978 election and we are at 1977 and early 1977, campaigns must start early.</text>

            <text syncTime="2170.029" offset="8780595">Just as a brief preliminary matter, with respect to the jurisdictional statement to which Mr. Nilson referred during the case of Auerbach versus Mandel, and that reference to what was in the jurisdictional statement, I think it might be helpful for the record to point out that it was not indeed the State’s position that a constitutional issue was raised in Auerbach versus Mandel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.346" offset="8869829">Quite to the contrary, it was the State’s position in their motion to affirm that no constitutional issue was raised in Auerbach versus Mandel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.472" offset="8906401">They indicated quite specifically in their motion to affirm that the entire matter was decided as a matter of statutory construction and that of course is precisely what Judge Winter determined initially in Auerbach versus Mandel and determined once again in the decision of the Three-Judge District Court in these proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.409" offset="8986126">With respect to the matter of the substantiality of the burden and the parity among the various candidates, both independent and primary party candidates or principle party candidates, I believe that there is another matter which has probated these proceeding and that is the question of parity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.999" offset="9056448">The question of whether or not indeed independent candidates are treated the same in the State of Maryland as are partisan party candidates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.849" offset="9087899">It was a matter which was raised before the Three-Judge District Court and it is a matter which has been raised here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.499" offset="9118515">I think the conclusion is inescapable that there is no parity, there is no fairness between the way the parties, the various candidates are treated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2401.122" offset="9704912">The record was replete with uncontradicted testimony that the independent candidate faced insurmountable difficulties at that stage of the process in getting his name upon the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.936" offset="9764262">Under such a circumstance this Court has held on numerous occasions, Buckley versus Valeo, in Storer versus Brown that the exacting scrutiny test is that test which must be applied, and under those circumstances the exacting scrutiny test being applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.286" offset="9837614">If that is applied in these instances then the question of compelling state interest becomes immediately before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.323" offset="9865721">Compelling state interest here have been found by the court below to be insubstantial of those which have been raised subsequent to the decision of the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.523" offset="9902606">We have treated with on brief, and while they indeed are raised by the State as compelling state interest, there does not appear to be anything in those which have been raised which are compelling in true sense of the word that they could not be dealt with in less restrictive means which this Court has mandated in Dunn versus Blumstein and similar cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.324" offset="9981810">For example, as this Court recognized, the plan which we have submitted or which we have suggested to the Court and which was, in effect, adopted by the court below, deals, we believe, with all of the issues which the State has raised in raising the issue of compelling state interests, and also provides a parity of access for independent candidates and removes the substantiality of the burdens which independent candidates face particularly in presidential election years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.161" offset="10097166">It was adopted essentially by simply providing that on the filing date, that mutual filing date which all the candidates have which in this instance was March 8th, that all of the candidates file their petitions, and our suggestion was and as adopted by the Court that with a nominal but not insubstantial number of petitions, petition signatures, and that between the time of the filing date and the primary date that all of the party candidates and all the independent candidates engage in the same kind of open discussion of the issues which this State has suggested are necessary in order to provide each with access to the ballot in a comparable fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.151" offset="10261111">So that during that period when the immediate interest is heightened when weather conditions are far substantially improved in most instances, when the issues of the campaign are begging to crystallize, and when voter interest is reaching its peak that each of the candidates both partisan candidates and independent candidates will have an opportunity of excess to the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2566.775" offset="10367586">We believe this is a way or perhaps the best way in this instance in which the Court can create, can alleviate the substantial barriers which exist in the State of Maryland because of the remoteness of the filing deadline, and still maintain and protect whatever compelling state interests truly exist in these situations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2841.288" offset="11465669">As Mr. Nilson has indicated those findings were uncontradicted that with respect to the burdens which were faced by the campaign organization at that time of remoteness from the general election deadline and primary deadline.</text>

            <text syncTime="2904.544" offset="11718639">However, the experience is quite the contrary in particular instances that in some instances for example in Baltimore City that determination of the validation of signatures can be made as rapidly as five days, and was in fact made as rapidly as five days.</text>

            <text syncTime="2941.756" offset="11867537">In summary, we would suggest that the court below was absolutely correct in its finding of the substantiality of the burden to the ballot faced by the independent candidate in Maryland, that the history of that balloting, of that polling in the State of the Maryland has determined precisely that it is very difficult indeed for a statewide candidate to achieve access to the ballot, and that in order for -- if there are compelling state interests in order for those compelling state interests to be given whatever recognition they must be given in the least possible restrictive way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.770" offset="12023540">The plan which was suggested by Mr. Bradley to the court below and which was adapted by the court below is precisely that plan which best effects the compelling state interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.077" offset="12072755">The test of experience is perhaps is as important as any. Mr. Bradley was afforded access to the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.576" offset="12098773">He was defeated in the general elections, but nevertheless none of the nine proffered state compelling interests were in any way threatened or impinged upon by the process which was devised by the court below and the process by which Mr. Bradley was afforded access to the ballot and participated in the general election process.</text>
