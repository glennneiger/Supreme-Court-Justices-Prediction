            <text syncTime="58.597" offset="334900">In 1973 Ruby Jones filed the complaint in the Denver District Court in which she alleged that Douglas Hildebrant, Bryan Maren (ph) and the City and County of Denver by respondent superior had killed her son Larry by shooting him in the back of the head.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.937" offset="412222">Bryan Maren was subsequently dismissed from that suit at the end of discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.862" offset="427896">The action proceeded against just officer Hildebrant and the City and County of Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.685" offset="455167">Her complaint stated three claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.333" offset="469796">First, battery and second negligence, both of these claims were properly brought under the Colorado Wrongful-Death Act and are controlled by Colorado Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.750" offset="511487">The third claim was brought pursuant to 42 U. S. C. 1983 and is a Federal claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="151.139" offset="705002">As a result, Hildebrant alleged that he was acting in self defense and he also alleged that Larry Jones was a fleeing felon and that the shooting was justified on that ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.934" offset="748261">But the jury rejected both of those defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.856" offset="763935">At the close of the evidence the defendants moved to dismiss Mrs. Jones' claim under 1983 on the grounds that it was redundant with her state claim.</text>
