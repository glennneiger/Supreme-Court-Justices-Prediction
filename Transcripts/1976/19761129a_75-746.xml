            <label>Mr. McNeill Stokes</label>
            <text syncTime="23.135" offset="195897">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.151" offset="208018">The issue in these cases involves whether our constitution allows the Federal Governments to issue fines against its citizens without the right to jury trial of their peers.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.200" offset="260159">We submit that the clear command of the Seventh Amendment of United States Constitution expressly forbids it.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.896" offset="290983">More fundamentally at issue is also the very bedrock of judicial power under Article 3 of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.165" offset="320031">These cases take on particular importance because they are the first cases to come before this Court of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 and its enforcement structure which is unique.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.252" offset="372381">The most obvious consequence of the Occupational Safety and Health Act’s enforcement structure is the United States Government seeks fines against its citizens administratively without the right to jury trial during any stage in the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.323" offset="424626">Under this most unusual enforcement structure of penalties, the inspector issues citations and fines turns civil penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.059" offset="467571">A citizen’s recourse is to another administrative agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, which is still part of the Executive Branch of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.864" offset="506859">Unlike other penalty statutes, there is only limited judicial review in the Court of Appeals in all effect which are determined administratively are conclusive if supported by substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.780" offset="558477">We submit that this executive agency, the delegation of power to this agency, violates the constitution in its relationships first to its citizens and that is providing a right to jury trial; and second in its relationships to Judicial Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.350" offset="620753">A ruling the petition’s favor will do no more than uphold the constitution as we have traditionally and historically known it.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.072" offset="647711">We submit that a ruling in the Government’s favor will effect the most profound redistribution of power among the three branches of Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.087" offset="683760">We are not asking the Court to expand on constitutional rights; we are merely asking the Court to recognize the traditional and historical right recognized by our Forefathers in the Seventh Amendment that a citizen has a right to jury trial when the Federal Government seeks a fine against him in whatever manner and whatever form it takes.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.764" offset="770382">We ask no more than that and we submit that constitution will tolerate nothing less.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.950" offset="795146">Now under OSHA, the Executive Branch of Government has been vested with plenary powers to determine and assess fines administratively without the right to jury trial and in violation of the Seventh Amendment, which provides that a citizen has a right to jury trial and suits at Common Law where the amount of controversy exceeds $20.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.642" offset="885948">This particular provision is extremely clear and the history is extremely clear that a suit at Common Law totally and unequivocally embraces a fine sought by the United States Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.723" offset="942268">At the time of the passage of the Seventh Amendment, both in England and United States, a citizen would have been afforded a right to jury trial when the government sought a fine against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.509" offset="981452">In England and at the time of the passage of the Seventh Amendment and for years before, a fine would have been brought on the judicial side of Court of Exchequer and there they would have gotten the right to jury trial under the Common Law side.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.884" offset="1054908">As we have briefed in our brief, all the states, virtually all of the states would have granted jury trial for fines and forfeitures at the time of the enactment of the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.846" offset="1106735">The history of this act or the history of this amendment, in England, was preserved in America under the Seventh Amendment in 1791.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.145" offset="1155950">Only in America did England ever attempt to the non- citizens jury trial and that was under the America’s Trade Act in the Courts of Vice-Admiralty, which historians tell us is one of the sparks that ignited the revolution and directly led to that provision to deliver -- that provision in the declaration of independence that said the Kind George has denied us jury trial in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.609" offset="1249782">Well, when Hancock’s ship, the sloop, Liberty was seized in Boston Harbor in 1767 along with its cargo, England also brought a case against him for an in personam fine of triple the amount of the goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.626" offset="1313834">Well, he hired a young lawyer defending him in those days, Boston Lawyer, John Adams, and Adam’s argument is just as valid before this court today as it was 200 years ago when he said the legislative authority by which this act is passed is grievous enough, but the way it is enforced with these executive tribunals makes it more penal than any of the statutes around.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.370" offset="1396903">He says “My client is not” -- and I am paraphrasing a little bit, he says, “My client is not tried by the law of the land by jury trial but by a single judge.”</text>
            <text syncTime="331.875" offset="1430862">And he says, “No matter how fair that judge is, it makes this act extremely penal and my client has lost a precious right, the right to jury trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="341.531" offset="1469524">Well, in 1791, this right was embedded in the constitution for all Americans to come as it was passed and codified in the Seventh Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.696" offset="1510170">In response to a call in one of the foremost price against the constitution was originally drafted was the a preservation of the right to jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.084" offset="1547682">It is now in great jeopardy, because now 200 years later, the Federal Government is seeking fines against its citizens and exactly tribunals with much similar procedures as those courts of Vice-Admiralty.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.444" offset="1605151">But more fundamentally the issue in this case, is the very bedrock of judicial power.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.581" offset="1637648">The Third Circuit’s opinion, the Third Circuit opinion in the case of Frank Irey basically held that the United States Government can vest, Congress can vest, an administrative tribunal with enforcement powers, in this case penalties, and thereby eliminate the Seventh Amendment right to jury trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.115" offset="1719881">Implicit in this holding is that Congress and not the Court have the power to determine when and if a provision of constitution applies merely by vesting it in an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.004" offset="1767424">Judge Gibbons and the other three dissenters in that case, as they saw, stoutly pointed out that if Congress can determine by legislative fiat when and if a provision of the Constitution applies and thereby define the meaning of the words, suits at common law, what role do the Article III courts play.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.848" offset="1842761">He also pointed out that it would be an absurd speculum if the only branch of government, bound by the Bill Of Rights, would be the Article III courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.172" offset="1880064">And in commenting on the majority’s holding of their interpretation of Jones &amp; Laughlin versus the National Labor Relations Board, he pointed out that if that case is interpreted for the breadths that the majority gave it, then undenounced to world of legal scholarship, that case affected the most profound and enormous redistribution of power of any case in the history of the United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. McNeill Stokes</label>
            <text syncTime="472.657" offset="1993958">Mr. Justice, our interpretation of Jones &amp; Laughlin merely stands for this doctrine that Congress can vest an administrative agency with traditional acquirer roles that is the seize and desist power, which is an equitable injunction remedy and an incidental back pay remedy which is a classic restitutionary remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.863" offset="2070862">But beyond that they cannot vest an administrative agency with powers that are judicial suits at Common Law.</text>

            <text syncTime="499.478" offset="2101269">What if the NLRB in that case had ordered only back pay?</text>
            <text syncTime="503.358" offset="2116838">Would you say they would have had to go to the court and be tried to a jury?</text>

            <text syncTime="507.141" offset="2131884">If the back pay is a restitutionary type of remedy, I would say that would be permissible in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.705" offset="2162186">If it arose in a situation where the NLRB add a seize and desist power coupled with back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.671" offset="2190085">But in OSHA, you are dealing with a naked vengeance penalty where the government is putting a penalty on its citizens for past violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.239" offset="2224358">It is the void of any acquittal consideration, the void of any restitutionary element and the void of any compensatory element.</text>

            <text syncTime="545.821" offset="2286634">We, in this case, we are not trying to invalidate any abatement powers of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.978" offset="2323310">We are merely saying, in the posture of these cases, they arrives in a posture wherein these case, they are monetary penalties, $5000 sought against Irey and $600 sought against Atlas Roofing Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.059" offset="2375659">We submit it is that violation that offends the constitution, the collection of monetary penalties, which are not at all incidental.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.248" offset="2404394">Of course, they could not be acquittal remedies under the classic doctrines that equity will not enforce a penalty and will not enforce criminal sanctions, particularly the penalty provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.361" offset="2448802">We submit, as we’ve briefed, that there are no sense ancillary and that, in this case, they are primary, and as a matter of fact that’s all that’s being sought in these cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="629.757" offset="2622360">There is great distinction, because if these cases arise on $5,000, but the same principle applies, no matter how it is if it’s in excess of $20, we submit to the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1765.825" offset="7166621">Absent the penalty, the act would be much less effective, because the only way -- nothing happens to you until you have an abatement order and the Court of Appeals enforces, and then you comply, so that the -- so the penalty feature is an integral part of this statute and that’s why I say that acceptance of Petitioner’s argument would go a long way towards collapsing this program as an effective national program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2085.328" offset="8444635">And thirdly, I think, it is also true that the penalties here are intertwined with equitable remedies and in itself, there is a great discretion over the size of the penalty, and is intertwined with the abatement action and supports the abatement action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.317" offset="8504613">So I think that under the Jones &amp; Laughlin case or under the Katchen case, I think that line of cases too support this; those are three reasons why I think -- I don’t offer any of those propositions that is that it’s a public right case where the Government is a party and that it’s intertwined with an equitable remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.526" offset="8585488">Perhaps, those three propositions do not completely exhaust the field of the Seventh Amendment and explain all practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.164" offset="8624044">But we author them as analytical factors, and when we look at, you might think they are the major analytical factors come out of the history and of the cases, and I think when you look at them, you discover that this case lies right at the core of the kind of case that may be moved by Congress into administrative adjudication.</text>

            <text syncTime="2820.672" offset="11386023">In addition Jones &amp; Laughlin suggest, as we said in, Southall Realty and Curtis against Loether that if it’s a public right case, an administrative agency case, you still don’t need a jury and that’s true here also and Jones &amp; Laughlin, of course, is an administrative determination made by a tribunal or by an agency set up under the Commerce Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.214" offset="12860270">There is no discussion of anybody’s fear of the Government as litigant, and that this is, in any way, designed to confine, to cure or to safeguard that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.485" offset="12905305">All of the discussion is about proposals which purport to save the jury trial in suits between man and the man which we think is a phrase that only means private litigation, or in suits respecting property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.219" offset="12980224">Now, of course, the suits respecting property dropped out; it was never proposed by Madison when he drafted the beginning of the Seventh Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3406.522" offset="13729416">There are lots of these things which I think are best explained by the fact that the government is a party, but this Court need not accept that principle in its totality to decide this case, because I think all of the three principled discussed here point to the fact that this case is at the core of Congress’s power to move the dispute into administrative adjudication.</text>
