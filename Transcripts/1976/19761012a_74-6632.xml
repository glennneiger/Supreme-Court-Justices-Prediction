            <text syncTime="40.207" offset="261336">Mr. Chief Justice and May it Please the Court, this case comes here upon a written Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit raising the question of whether a federal parolee, who violates his parole by the commission of the new crime is constitutionally entitled to a due process revocation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.054" offset="340644">Early during the service of the intervening sets, two questions must be analyzed, the source or nature of the interest and the process, which is due if there is an interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.295" offset="389649">As the fact in the case will reveal, such a hearing in this case will determine how much of the almost six years due on the petition is first sentence will be served concurrently, with his present sentence and thus will effect his ultimate release date from custody all together.</text>

            <text syncTime="104.129" offset="517022">Your Honor, under this scheme, let us step back a minute and say that he is in fact still on parole.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="114.226" offset="557355">Well, we can hypothesize that, but the fact is, he is in another prison through the commission of another crime while he was on probation while he was on parole.</text>

            <label>Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger</label>
            <text syncTime="122.888" offset="592046">Yes Your Honor, the scheme of the rules under which this case takes place of the parole board and visions that there is indeed a good likelihood or a possibility of concurrency and in fact in Jones against Johnson decided by the DC Circuit in -- notes a survey taken by the Federal Parole Board, which would indicate that one in three of such parolees do in fact serve their sentence concurrently or have to detain and revoked all together.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="155.060" offset="720673">How does that work out in fact Mrs. Bamberger, would you explain that to us, how the concurrency comes about?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="161.164" stopTime="213.924">
            <label>Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger</label>
            <text syncTime="161.164" offset="745124">Yes Your Honor, under the rules as they applied in this case and those rules are no longer in effect because of the new statute and the new rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.392" offset="778038">The board would review a file, the parole board file and we know that the file consisted of the pre-sentence report, the case agents report, the information, which the supervising parole officer had obtained during the period of parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.164" offset="849091">At the end of that review the board could give one of three dispositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.922" offset="868213">It could revoke; it could remove the detainer all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.147" offset="885035">In that situation, the parolee would get full concurrency with the present sentence and in fact he would be restored to the position that he would have been in, had the warrant never been issued that is, he would get street time, he would get good time and his sentences would in essence be running at the same time.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="213.924" stopTime="221.727">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="213.924" offset="956193">When you say full concurrency that means that the time that he would be serving under his first sentence begins to run again.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="phylis_skloot_bamberger" startTime="221.727" stopTime="327.865">
            <label>Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger</label>
            <text syncTime="221.727" offset="987331">It would have, yes; it would have lost no time back to the date of his release in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.057" offset="1008751">Now, the other -- the second disposition, which the board could have made, is to revoke parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.326" offset="1037799">Now, that is where we get into the question and the real possibility which would come up in a case such as this, from the moment of the board's decision to revoke parole, this sentence would start to run, would commence to run concurrently, with the new sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.011" offset="1120555">In other words the issuance of the warrant stopped the time on the first sentence from running.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.733" offset="1143439">When the board gives its review and makes a decision to execute the warrant in essence to revoke parole, from that moment onto the board's regulation, the time commences to run again and it is in fact running concurrently, with the new term and so he is actually serving the two sentences at the same time and his release date on the first sentence will obviously be shortened because he is serving that sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.919" offset="1252108">Now, the third disposition, the one which took place here is to have the file review and to do nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.238" offset="1277395">To let detect the warrant and the detainer's stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.746" offset="1291501">In that situation it is automatic under the board's prior rules and under the present rule that the first sentence will be served consecutively to the new sentence so, that when he is released from the second sentence and returned to the Federal Institution he then recommences that first sentence and he has to serve it.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.809" offset="1387736">Now, he maybe released on parole at some point later on but, he still either in custody or in parole custody.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.742" offset="1471432">There is no provision either under the old rules or under the new rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.015" offset="1488568">For the Board to make the sentence run back to an earlier point in time.</text>

            <text syncTime="662.224" offset="2749342">Now this is not the argument that was rejected in Meachum and Montayne although we do present that argument in our briefing, we believe that under the Bureau of Prisons Regulation there is an interest in the conditions that a prisoner has in an institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="693.285" offset="2873581">Oh yes, there is a difference and in fact two states which again signs the amicus brief, direct they lodge the detainer so that the confining prison will have notice that there is another preceding pending and then they lift the detainer with a notice to the confining institution that the detainer is not to have any effect on the conditions of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.167" offset="2965114">Now as a Bureau of Prisons Regulations cited in our brief indicate there is consideration separately of the facts, of the new crime and the fact of the detainer being present.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.559" offset="3018717">The reason is two fold, number one the bureau prison considers in making it is classification study both the length of total confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.845" offset="3055811">Now where there is a detainer pending the length of total confinement can be much longer because he may have to serve the parole sentence and the parole board has in essence notified not only that it wants to take this man back, but that he may have to serve a very long sentence or some sentence at the end of the intervening sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.668" offset="3131148">The other thing that the Bureau of Prisons considers in this classification study is whether the individual can sustain himself in a position of relatively unsupervised or degree of supervision that he is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.104" offset="3196872">Now if the detainer is present it is an indication to the Bureau of Prisons, that there was something wrong with the parolees ability to structure himself without constant watching and that also goes into the classification study, what institution he will be in, what jobs will be available to him whether he will be on minimum or maximum custody in that institution so that yes the detainer does have a definite and separate impact aside from the fact of the new crime on the classification now?</text>

            <text syncTime="893.770" offset="3675540">The federal parole scheme requires a two-stage process exactly like the one outlined in Morrissey.</text>

            <text syncTime="909.667" offset="3739174">The board has an obligation to make a disposition it is not required to make any particular disposition, it is not required to revoke and this gets back to an earlier question that was asked, if the board were required to revoke on the basis of a new conviction, then he would not have any claim, conviction would eliminate his interest in conditional freedom which was provided by the grant of parole.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="937.109" offset="3848888">Perhaps the Board's position might be that we don't want to make the decision on whether we revoke the parole until we see how he conducts himself in this second round under his second conviction, that is if during that second period his conduct is such that he has denied all his good time credits if he engages in prison riots and violence, I suppose you agree that the parole board would not be very sympathetic with having his sentences run concurrently.</text>

            <label>Ms. Phylis Skloot Bamberger</label>
            <text syncTime="970.421" offset="3982113">Well let me answer that by saying that the board can consider an early hearing, all of the non-institutional factors related to medication.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.245" offset="4017430">Now, now, yes, get to you -- if they make the decision and is unfavorable to the parolee, during the term of his institution, the board has the right to reopen based on information it receives I think from the institution so that it can reconsider an adverse decision to the parolee, based on institutional conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.277" offset="4097574">Now, if they render a favorable decision to the parolee and he is granted paroles, so he can serve a dual status, which he is recognized in the parole scheme, he can be serving the second sentence and on parole with respect to the first sentence, the board can in essence revoke the parole that it had granted him, based on his prison conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.570" offset="4174792">So, the board is not left without a remedy either looking to the favorable or adverse institutional conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.878" offset="4208020">Now, the question is to whether or not, this reconsideration of the case has to have an in court appearance the due process requirements of such a review proceeding is not before the court, but the board is not precluded even by its own rules it never has been, from considering institutional conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.873" offset="4291925">In the first situation under the rules which applied at the time this case came up it did by an annual review -- under the board's present statute, they can always reopen and always reconsider information which is presented to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.566" offset="4342707">So, I think that the argument that the institutional conduct has to be considered is correct, but it does not go far enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.169" offset="4377189">Because what we have to do is we have to freeze the mitigating circumstances that would come up with respect to the life in the community and the factors of the new crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.364" offset="4417940">Now, the question of mitigation of course goes to what process is due under the circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.624" offset="4446988">What is the interest, what is the private interest of the parolee in presenting his mitigating circumstances and I think that that is where that factor comes up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.384" offset="4481992">If a parolee has committed a new crime, the board can consider that it also can consider its full record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.563" offset="4526714">But at the time of this record review, the parolee is not allowed to be present, he does not know, what is in the parole, what file, because until the present statute and the possible applicability of their right to privacy act proficiency, had no disclosure of the file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.825" offset="4583765">Now, we do not know what the file indicates in this case, but the government has indicated from the facts it has presented that there are certain mitigating circumstances, for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.340" offset="4617829">In this case, the Judge could have sentenced the defendants up to life imprisonment, he did not, he gave him two consecutive terms of custody -- I am sorry, two concurrent terms of custody of only up to ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.483" offset="4674358">Although he is discretion to impose a life sentence, was presents He also made the sentence run under 4208A2, which meant that the parole board could parole him on the second crime at any point it decides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.899" offset="4724095">Obviously the judge believed that they was something there which did not require the full extent of his sentencing power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.370" offset="4757950">Now, the government appendix includes a document from the parole board files, and it is interesting because that document in itself contains information which is not confirmed, which we do not know is error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.097" offset="4812911">For instance, it indicates, that he murdered his wife, in fact that was not the crime that he was convicted of, he was convicted of voluntary man slaughter in the heat of passion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.930" offset="4860245">Now, we do not know what those facts are, it's not reflected in the record, nor in the documents which the government chooses to add as part of its appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.323" offset="4897757">It reflects that there was a conflict as to his family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.733" offset="4915416">The report indicates that his family had alcoholic problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.812" offset="4927746">He indicates that he had a good family relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.214" offset="4937359">Now in terms of whether or not to provoke parole, where the parolee will live is obviously an important consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.883" offset="4964004">There is a very critical dispute of fact here, which should have been resolved that is, in a situation where the parolee could present his mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.403" offset="5002038">Now the government argues that they were no mitigating circumstances presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.646" offset="5015099">I think, the fact is due impart, number one to the possibility, which is reflected in the record that Mr. Petitioner did not know that he could submit mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.386" offset="5062015">He was never told that and the documents submitted by the board established that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.679" offset="5083226">The second factor of course is the same as in Goldberg is that he might not have known how to do it or what was relevant or what to put before the court because he had no representation, no one who could assist him in that and then as another matter he never knew the basis for the board's decision to make his sentence run consecutively because they never told him what factors they were considering and the reasons for their decision to make the sentence run consecutively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.443" offset="5194195">So, the absence of mitigating circumstances here, should not be held against the petitioner and in fact the record as presented by the government indicates that there maybe substantial disputes of fact and the board should have known both sides of the story in an amply presented argument on behalf of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.687" offset="5275174">Now, if the government argues that its total discretion to revoke the parole after a new crime eliminates liberty and eliminates the parole status which he still presently enjoys the answer ti think is that both Gagnant and Morrissey and Goldsmith and Roth dispute that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.507" offset="5374544">They lay it to rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.166" offset="5381127">Gagnant and Morrissey both say that we have here there is a vested interest which he still has both the state and the parolee have an interest in accurate fact finding and in informed used of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.586" offset="5434835">The citation in Roth to Goldsmith indicates that the board's discretionary power must be construed to mean an exercise of discretion after investigation, notice hearing an opportunity to respond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.477" offset="5486348">None of that was afforded here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.462" offset="5494289">Now, the remedy that would be afforded the petitioner in this instance would be first if the Court would define that there was not an interest and we are also to find that is protected by due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.506" offset="5542459">The first remedy would be to remand to the District Court to determine whether or not he lost any mitigating evidence due to the substantial delay between 1971 in this time in granting the time of hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.341" offset="5593868">If that were not true, if he had not lost any mitigating evidence then he would be entitled to a parole revocation under the new statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.487" offset="5626469">Now it is not necessary for the court to consider the new statute, if we were to find that the old proceedings were invalid because the new statute affords the petitioner certain due process rights, which may indeed satisfy Morrissey depending upon how the board or the commission now chooses to enforce its new rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.170" offset="5713195">First it provides them with counsel, second it may provide him with disclosure of the full file, third the board may find that under its regulations it can provide notice of the reasons and the facts underlying its decision and its own regulations require notice of the underlying charges and the reason and Arbitron (ph) procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.673" offset="5807132">So that I think, if we find that the old procedures were invalid that the new ones should be given an opportunity to be used in this situation to determine whether or not it provides with due process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1463.366" offset="5953940">So that unless the old procedures are deemed invalid which we believe they are because there is an interest, there is a present interest as Roth defines it and the old procedures did not adequately protect that interest then he would be entitled to a new proceeding to determine whether or not his parole should be revoked to determine whether or not he should get concurrent sentences and to determine whether or not as the board has the option to do, to leave the detainer in effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.295" offset="6273679">The claim of a right to an immediate oral parole hearing in this case has an air of impossibility to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.890" offset="6304085">Petitioner is not now suffering imprisonment on account of his parole violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.151" offset="6325088">No one proposes to revoke his parole now. He suffers no loss of freedom now because of the possibility of revocation a year from now when his sentences for murder and man slaughter will come to an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.395" offset="6378064">His loss is caused by his intervening convictions and ten-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.032" offset="6396559">The possibility of revocation eventually is not caused by the detainer lodged against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.843" offset="6419860">It was caused by the intervening convictions upon his plea of guilty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.011" offset="6484539">In the sentencing hearing on his two convictions, he had both the opportunity and the incentive to bring forward any mitigating evidence he might have that might induce either the sentencing judge or the Parole Commission to treat him leniently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.570" offset="6546710">Petitioner has met with a social worker in Federal Prison and refused even to discuss with a social worker any mitigating conditions or circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.086" offset="6580774">He told the social worker that all the information was in his file.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.967" offset="6596343">That statement appears at page 26A if the appendix are brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.768" offset="6615569">To this day, petitioner has not said what he wants to say in an immediate oral dispositional hearing, let alone what he wants to say that can not be conveyed equally well on paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.073" offset="6664784">He has made no claim that would, if true, induce the Parole Commission to revoke his parole and to let the revocation run concurrently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.084" offset="6704804">I would evoke my argument to three propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.874" offset="6715984">First, that no hearing is necessary at any time once the violations of the conditions of parole have been established as they were here beyond dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.673" offset="6763213">Second, that the time for an oral hearing if one is required, does not arrive until the end of the intervening sentence when the Parole Commission decides to revoke a petitioner's parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.514" offset="6814518">Third, that if something is required before that time, the Parole Commission's dispositional review procedure provides ample safeguards against error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.723" offset="6859344">The due process clause requires a hearing concerning the revocation of petitioner's parole in this case; only if petitioner has a liberty interest or a property interest in continuing to be a parolee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.675" offset="6907200">We think that there is no liberty of property interest in a case like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.624" offset="6926949">Petitioner doubtless has an interest in a constitutional sentence held in common with his other men in being free from imprisonment until by a judgment of a court of confident jurisdiction it has been decided that he must surrender that interest for a period of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.784" offset="6999569">That interest was extinguished for a period of ten years by his 1962 conviction for rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.544" offset="7026632">Petitioner served a little more than four years of that before being released on parole and that release on parole restored to him a form of conditional liberty, parole, created by statute, the terms and conditions and extent of which were defined entirely by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.206" offset="7093297">This new conditional liberty is a creature of statute and petitioner has no more of it than the statute provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.338" offset="7125793">The Federal Statutes and Regulations provide for termination of this conditional liberty if the parolee commits another crime that happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.959" offset="7160275">Once that happens, every fact necessary to revoke parole has been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.135" offset="7185039">The decision whether to revoke parole in response to those facts is committed to the discretion of the Parole Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.082" offset="7212833">Let me make it clear that we have no dispute with Morrissey's holding that a grant of parole sets up a legitimate claim of entitlement that can be revoked only upon provision of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.743" offset="7263406">What this means though is that before revoking parole, the responsible officials must determine by a procedure comporting with the due process clause, that the conditions of the parole have been violated.</text>

            <text syncTime="1885.990" offset="7644480">That has happened here, there have been two convictions of guilty, it is clear that those convictions are reasonable grounds for revoking parole, when we think that ends the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1894.571" offset="7678753">But Morrissey went on the say, that it would be useful to have a parole hearing and this is at page 488.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.272" offset="7705607">For the purpose of determining whether the parole board should exercise discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.623" offset="7730998">We have no dispute with that either, the relevant federal statutes, both at the time of the consideration of petitioner's case and now, provide for two hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.202" offset="7773316">One is an alternate hearing before parole is revoked and one is the dispositional review which may or may not include a hearing depending upon whether the Parole Commission believes that one is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.495" offset="7814485">So, we have no dispute with a proposition that it is useful to have a hearing to determine how the discretion shall be exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.333" offset="7837786">The question whether the constitution requires that hearing is we think left open in Morrissey because in Morrissey the fact of violation itself was disputed and the question whether the constitution required hearing in the absence of such a dispute was not before the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2427.273" offset="9809613">The hearing at the end of the intervening sentence is the best time because then, the Parole Commission has available to it all of the information about the parolee's institutional behavior and can answer the question, should the prisoner now be released?</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.431" offset="9866247">It will have access to the parolee's prison record and it will avoid the inconvenience of sending teams of examiners to prisons to make recommendations that will in every case or almost every case have to be reconsidered at the end of the intervening sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.768" offset="9927582">A hearing could be required years before the ultimate decision on revocation only if the detainer affected liberty of property rights in some way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.981" offset="9960392">As we understand that this is the core of petitioner's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.180" offset="9973244">Petitioner has suggested a number of ways in which that might happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.497" offset="9986410">The detainer might affect the conditions for confinement on the intervening sentence, the delay might jeopardize the opportunity for concurrent service of the term or the delay might permit the laws of mitigating evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.000" offset="10040431">We submit that the argument about affect on the conditions of confinement must yield to this Court's decision in Meachum against Fano, which held it when prison officials have descretioned to choose the place and conditions of confining, the due process clause does not require particular procedures to be used in making that choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.477" offset="10110335">The choice itself does not involve a legitimate claim of entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.618" offset="10126949">In the Federal Prison System it is true as petitioner contends that the officials know whether there has been a detainer and in many cases they consider whether that detainer should have any effect on their decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2519.403" offset="10178044">But, the fact that a detainer has been considered is known from the fact in Meachum that the prison officials considered whether the prisoners there had committed arson or had been alleged to commit arson or might commit arson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.152" offset="10237081">The question is not whether particular facts have been considered in making the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.018" offset="10252546">The question is whether there is a duty to respond to those facts in particular ways that is whether there is a legitimate claim of entitlement to have particular conditions of confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2547.639" offset="10290998">There is none in the Federal Prison System.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.402" offset="10298103">Petitioner has not contended that there is and we submit that there is no liberty or property interest from that source.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.836" offset="10323808">Second source, the one with which petitioner opened the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.727" offset="10339377">If the argument that opportunities for concurrent revocation, concurrent service of the revoked term will be lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.640" offset="10371037">We submit that that argument is simply fallacious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2570.152" offset="10381068">It is fallacious as matter of fact and it doesn't help petitioner even if it's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.322" offset="10401757">First, because of the dispositional review that is now provided, the warrant can be dismissed and the detainer released with or without an oral hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.647" offset="10443030">The absence of an oral hearing does not prevent concurrent service of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.318" offset="10465705">But more importantly, after the intervening sentence has expired, the commission has a number of options available to it, each of which will achieve in practice, the equivalent of concurrent service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.506" offset="10514502">First, the commission can decide simply not to revoke parole, to withdraw the warrant, to treat it as if it that never existed, that achieves concurrent service in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.236" offset="10557447">It can decide to revoke and grant immediate reparole and that is provided by section 4214 D5 of the Parole Commission Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2623.309" offset="10593705">This has much of the same effect, but we understand that petitioner's objection to the revocation and the immediate reparole is that it will extend the length of the time as a parolee and that there are some ancillary restrictions during that extent of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.085" offset="10656817">The Parole Commission has a statutory device to deal with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.246" offset="10673430">Section 4211 of the new Parole Commission Act says that the commission can on its own motion terminated supervision over the parolee at any time so that although his time as a parolee might be extended by a revocation and immediate reparole, the commission has the discretion under 4211 to terminate that supervision achieving concurrency or partial concurrency, retroactively.</text>

            <text syncTime="2847.612" offset="11490959">Finally petitioner has an argument that mitigating evidence might be lost in interim and that this will effect the Commission's ultimate decision, but petitioner has never contended that he has any such evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.047" offset="11544666">His habeas corpus pleading on the District Court in this case contended that the reason for requiring and prompt hearing was to have the opportunity for concurrent service of the revoked sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.089" offset="11584790">Moreover the commission has rules that will allow him to have an oral hearing, if he were to make persuasive claim that he has mitigating evidence, that it might effect the decision and that it might be lost, but petitioner has never made a claim of that sort either in his pleadings or at any later stage and the claim that evidence might dissipate in some cases is we submit not enough to require in oral hearing in every case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.429" offset="11686146">Even in cases decided under the Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment in which dissipation of the evidence and in which the possibility of prejudice to defense is oppressing if not overriding concern.</text>

            <text syncTime="2931.295" offset="11825639">Finally I turn to petitioners argument, that the procedures now used by the Parole Commission are inadequate to guard against these kinds of intervening losses, the loss of possibility of concurrent revocation, the loss of mitigating evidence doing the interim and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.070" offset="11896797">We think that the argument has little to recommend it , commission conducts a full file review sets an oral hearing, wherever it appears the one would be useful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.442" offset="11934204">Petitioner's argument those quickly boils down to the argument that there must be a hearing in every case even when it does not seem likely to serve a useful purpose in a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.262" offset="11977568">We start in this regard from the proposition that if parolee is convicted of another crime while on parole then revocation of parole to begin after the intervening sentence is the ordinary disposition, the Parole Commissions rule so provide and that is rule 2.47C which we reprinted at page 13(a) of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.931" offset="12060219">What the commission does is establish a file review and essentially require the parolee to bare the initial burden of showing that he should receive exceptional treatment and that an oral hearing as opposed to a paper file review, is necessary in order to determine whether they are so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.700" offset="12131272">We think that there can be no doubt that that comports with the Due Process Cause, even to the extent something is required in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.618" offset="12158962">The interest involved for parolee are slight as I have pointed out the fact of incarceration itself is not a state because that was determined for the 1971 murder conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.390" offset="12198041">The Parole Commission has ample discretion to allow concurrent revocation, retroactively or partial concurrent revocation and it is unlikely for someone who has been convicted of murder will show that he is entitled to exceptional treatment, but putting that aside its clear that whatever procedures the Parole Commission may use their is no chance of an erroneous decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3256.071" offset="13124761">The government refers to its new regulation to say, that they can give partial retroactive concurrency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.518" offset="13146495">I think the government misconstrues the words of the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.101" offset="13168856">If not the intent it relates to (Inaudible) under the statute, a parolee who violates by anything but a new conviction or a new crime is entitled to receive credit for the time that he has served while on parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.808" offset="13235729">The exception is for a parolee who violates the parole by the commission of the new crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.664" offset="13263106">He loses his (Inaudible) time and that Section relates directly to the loss of (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.666" offset="13291109">The question of retroactive concurrency, partial retroactive concurrency I think is answered by 4214 D which is the relief provision of the new statute which applies to the hearing which is granted at the end of the intervening sentence and it lists five dispositions which the board might make at a hearing granted at that time and partial retroactive concurrency, is not one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.078" offset="13396748">The board's own regulation section 2.52 does not include that as a possible remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.487" offset="13434469">I think the government misconstrues the decision in Zerbst.</text>
            <text syncTime="3337.254" offset="13449515">In Zerbst the petitioners were requesting that the parole board must make the sentences run concurrently.</text>

            <text syncTime="3399.449" offset="13698306">Well, the government's position is that the total withdrawal of the detainer and the warrant at the end of the intervening sentence, where the new crime is serious is not likely to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.899" offset="13752118">But what is more likely to occur is the possibility of concurrency where the violated does not get everything but he gets something and the inability to give the partial retroactive concurrency deprives the parolee of that intermediate dispositional aspect which the commission can grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.510" offset="13830485">I think the government misconstrues that line in Morrissey and Gagnon which, Morrissey which relies on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.407" offset="13858070">That section relates to those jurisdictions in which there is no discretion where there is a violation of parole not to revoke, in other words as in Tennessee, where the sentences must be served concurrently on a finding of violation, that sentence in Morrissey would apply, that would not need to give a hearing on the dispositional aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.170" offset="13965173">But where there is a discretion, Morrissey in no fewer than three places at 480, 484, 488 and at Gagnon in 411 and 790 say, that where there is this discretion, the hearing must be given and it is interesting to know that in Gagnon, the violation was admitted by the parolee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.426" offset="14062139">He said, he had committed the burglary and so, the court with that fact still viewed the dual aspect of the process very important.</text>

            <text syncTime="3503.065" offset="14112712">Oh, yes, we are not disputing that he has admitted it, but we are saying that even where he admits it, the dispositional phase is still critical and the government attempts to distinguish Morrissey and Gagnon, saying that they do not apply where the parolee has admitted the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3518.406" offset="14174048">They are hardly distinguishable if that fact existed in those very cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.882" offset="14195990">The government asserts here that we urge that an oral hearing is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.538" offset="14218665">Now, it is all position that the old board's rule which did not provide for notice, disclosure of the file, any kind of representation or any statement of the facts or reasons does not comport with Morrissey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.283" offset="14273626">If the court finds that is true, then the parolee in this case, the petitioner would be entitled to a new hearing at the present time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.126" offset="14304973">Now, under the new rules, he would be entitled to more than, what he had been entitled to then and it is all position that perhaps in some situations, an oral hearing would not be required, but that this is not a decision which the court must make now.</text>
