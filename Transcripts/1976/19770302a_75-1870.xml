            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100551">We will hear arguments next in 75-1870 and 1872, Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co. v. Collins, and the consolidated case.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.549" offset="262719">Mr. David Ferber, I think you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. David Ferber</label>
            <text syncTime="43.080" offset="272855">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.475" offset="290409">As this Court knows, a closed-end investment company, like a mutual fund, which is an open-end investment company, consists of a portfolio of securities that is managed in the interest of its stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.277" offset="369612">Unlike a mutual fund, the outstanding stock of a closed-end investment company is not redeemable at the instance of the shareholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.488" offset="418409">Over the years, the stock of closed-end companies is usually traded on the market at a significant difference from the value of the asset portfolio, usually substantially lower.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.774" offset="491552">It is this disparity between the asset value, that is, the market value of the portfolio held by a closed-end investment company, in this case, Christiana Securities Company, and the lower value in the market of its own stock, the Christiana stock, that gives rise to the difference in this case between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.115" offset="628956">The case involves the reasonableness of the Commission’s determination that the terms of a proposed merger of Christiana Securities Company and E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co. are within the meaning of Section 17(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, reasonable and fair, and do not involve overreaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.703" offset="747343">As the Court knows Du Pont of course is a giant industrial company, having some 47 million shareholders and its stock is considered to as a prime investment quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.753" offset="811500">Christiana is a closed-end company with some 8,000 shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.143" offset="837100">Its stock is traded on the over-the-counter market.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.683" offset="855281">98% of its assets consist of Du Pont common stock, and that adds up to some 28% of all of Du Pont’s stock outstanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.643" offset="915049">Now, the merger that is involved here essentially provides that Christiana is to turn over all its assets, consisting almost entirely of its Du Pont stock and will then disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.632" offset="987042">Du Pont will issue its common stock in a slightly smaller amount than the amount turned in by Christiana to Christiana’s shareholders.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="235.398" offset="1042109">Mr. Ferber, I suppose it is not relevant, but how long has Christiana been in existence?</text>
            <text syncTime="241.299" offset="1065723">Was it formed in the Personal Holding Company Act days?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_ferber" startTime="245.192" stopTime="365.518">
            <label>Mr. David Ferber</label>
            <text syncTime="245.192" offset="1081292">Yes, it was formed around 1915, I believe, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.116" offset="1105011">And I believe that Du Pont was formed about the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.591" offset="1138866">In all, there are 13.4 roughly shares of Du Pont stock that Christiana is turning into Du Pont and there is about 13.2 million shares that Du Pont is putting back.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.031" offset="1208665">So under the effect of the transaction is really a liquidation of Christiana that will cost its shareholders approximately 1.8% of its assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.729" offset="1263418">Now, that comes to less than 2.5% of the difference, because of course the same Christiana stockholders will become Du Pont shareholders and that accounts for the difference between the 2.5%, which would be about $55.6 million, and the cost of the merger to the Christiana stockholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.194" offset="1397269">The great advantage of course to the, or one of the advantages to the Christiana’s stockholders by this kind of a merger is that it permits the elimination of Christiana without the heavy tax consequences that would be required either by Christiana liquidating by distributing its Du Pont stock to its Christiana shareholders, or by somehow selling that stock and distributing the money to the shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.895" offset="1556094">The advantage --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="365.518" stopTime="374.530">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="365.518" offset="1562572">Well, I take that there is no challenge or question about the qualifications of tax-free transaction with the Internal Revenue Code?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_ferber" startTime="374.530" stopTime="697.752">
            <label>Mr. David Ferber</label>
            <text syncTime="374.530" offset="1598621">As I understand the internal revenue people have approved the proposed transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.658" offset="1639163">What it will do, particularly for any Christiana shareholders which would want to sell his shares, is he will presumably get somewhere between 20-25% more than he would get if he were just went out on the market and sold his Christiana stock, because that has been 20-25% the discount over the past few years, prior to the announcement of this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.097" offset="1760894">The amount cumulatively as of the figures in 1972, on which the record was based, would be a saving, if you total it all up and if everyone were going to sell their stock, which of course is not going to occur, of some $450 million for the Christiana security holders.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.670" offset="1843127">The merger is subject to the Commission approval because 17(a) of the Act provides that an affiliate of an investment company, which Du Pont is by definition, may not purchase “any security or other property from such investment company” unless the Commission finds under Section 17(b) of the Act that the “terms, including consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching”.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.082" offset="2000802">The Commission made this fairness finding on the ground that the transaction was based primarily, almost entirely, upon an exchange of equivalents: Du Pont stock for Du Pont stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.051" offset="2064750">Using the market value of the Christiana stock as the Court of Appeals indicated should have been used at least to some degree would of course deprive the Christiana shareholders of a significant portion of the value of their company’s assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.299" offset="2149700">The Commission also specifically found that the Du Pont stockholders would be in no way injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.378" offset="2181988">They would be benefited in fact to the extent that each share would represent a somewhat greater interest in Du Pont, there being 188,500 fewer Du Pont shares outstanding after the merger than before.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.204" offset="2257325">In addition, the Du Pont Company would get some $34 million of the remaining 2% of Christiana’s assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.437" offset="2310197">The Commission must approve any application under Section 17(b) if it can make the requisite findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.495" offset="2350530">There is no public interest consideration that is spelled into the statute at this point, but the Commission did indicate that the elimination of the unnecessary holding Company was sound and salutary, pointing to the provisions of Section 11(b) of the Holding Company Act, where the Commission of course has been instructed to get rid of, and has over the years done so, of many of the unnecessary holding companies in the Electric and Gas Holding Company systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.876" offset="2495980">The majority of the Court of Appeals held that the Commission erred in establishing “a rule of law that closed-end investment companies should be presumably worth the value of their net assets”.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.859" offset="2567973">The Court of Appeals held; the majority of two judges, that fairness required the Commission to give substantial weight to the market price of Christiana stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.464" offset="2614367">It stated also that the Commission had to find “that the transaction carries the earmarks of an arm’s length bargain”.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.228" offset="2657416">So in effect it held, the Commission could not find the proposed merger fair unless Du Pont should have exerted its strategic bargaining position to extract probably as much as several hundred million dollars worth of Christiana’s assets as consideration for Du Pont going along.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.017" offset="2752607">I propose to deal in the rest of my time with the justification of the Commission’s use of asset value, essentially the value of Christiana’s Du Pont holdings and the Court’s error in holding, first, that the market value of Christiana’s stock was to be given substantial weight, and second, that the transactions must have the indicia of arm’s length bargaining as the Court interpreted that term.</text>

            <text syncTime="724.965" offset="3000352">Exactly, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.298" offset="3005681">So that the Christiana people are being permitted to own directly a little less of what they owned indirectly through Christiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.969" offset="3040371">I was about to say that Mr. Gribbon will deal with suggestions of the Court of Appeals and of petitioners, that even if the Commission would otherwise have been right, it could not approve the merger because there was an insufficient sharing of the benefits, and because the alleged detrimental market impact the merger would have on Du Pont stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.502" offset="3158549">Contrary to the Court of Appeals, it is our position that each of the subjects that the Court of Appeals dealt with; statutory language, legislative history, prior Commission decisions, and practice under comparable statutory provisions, that the Commission did act in accordance with each of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.521" offset="3254575">The use of the Net Asset Value, the value of Christiana’s portfolio, is certainly in accord with the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.553" offset="3298670">The words reasonable, fair, not involving overreaching, describing the terms, including the consideration to be paid or received, describe exactly what the Commission found to be an exchange of equivalents; Du Pont stock for Du Pont stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.340" offset="3381844">Du Pont is not buying, as the Court of Appeals indicated, Christiana stock, it is buying Du Pont stocks since that is the -- and that is the consideration to be paid within the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.965" offset="3452375">An investment company, unlike an operating company, has no going concern value, that is, a full investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.140" offset="3497096">There are some that are so-called hybrid companies that might have some business operation as well as being an investment company, but in the company that has only securities which have a market, the way the value has always been determined by the Commission and generally in most instances is, you measured the value of its assets, its portfolio.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.833" offset="3611826">As the Commission noted, it said, investment companies are, as a general rule, media for long-term investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.657" offset="3643173">That makes Net Asset Value the touchstone and the Act is based on that premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.974" offset="3672430">The use of Net Asset Value also is in accord with the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.169" offset="3697194">The Commission stated: Congress chose to protect closed-end stockholders against dilution of intrinsic value.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.458" offset="3730318">The 1939 study of the Commission that led to the Investment Company Act showed that security holders were often in need of protection against their affiliates.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.782" offset="3779637">The report is filled with numerous examples of unscrupulous managers, who are entering into transactions with their investment company and diluting the Net Asset Value.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.685" offset="3831255">That many shareholders of Christiana maybe sophisticated, unlike perhaps the more usual situation with investment companies, does not mean that they are not to be accorded the same protections that Congress provided for all shareholders of investment companies, and Section 17 was the means Congress set up for that protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.447" offset="3934282">Now, the Court cites numerous opinions to suggest that the Commission has not always found that Net Asset Value is the appropriate test.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.607" offset="3986944">The Commission has always said that, that is the starting point, where you have an investment company that does consist, like Christiana, solely of securities.</text>

            <text syncTime="984.854" offset="4039921">We will resume there, Mr. Ferber, at 1 o’clock.</text>

            <text syncTime="1005.299" offset="4121736">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.838" offset="4127901">When the break came, I was just about to point out that the Court of Appeals, we think, misread the Commission’s opinions in stating that the Commission did not always give great weight to the Net Asset Value, that is, the Portfolio Value Test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.989" offset="4232495">Some of the cases which the Court of Appeals cited were situations where the investment company involved was what I described before as a hybrid company; a company that had enough securities for investment purposes that it fell within the Act, that also was operating a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.821" offset="4315774">And in those situations the business would of course be valued, as businesses normally are, in accordance with its income and expenses and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.870" offset="4368019">The other types of cases, and there were several, particularly the Talley case, which involved the Talley-General Times merger, where neither of the company was an investment company, because Section 17 is broad enough to catch mergers between affiliates of an investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.473" offset="4438340">You have that situation where there was a machinery company and a great many other things in General Times, which was a watch company when merging, and so the Net Asset Value, the portfolio value of the stock was not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.462" offset="4518380">The fourth area in which the Court disagreed with the Commission was that the Court suggested that the Net Asset Value Test of the Commission was not consistent with some of the reorganization statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.759" offset="4591522">But certainly the Public Utility Holding Company Act, under which the Commission for many years in the 1940s and 1950s particularly was conducting reorganizations of electric and gas utility holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.485" offset="4654425">In those cases, one thing that goes through all the cases is that the security holder is to receive the equitable equivalent of what he is giving up, and of course that seems to be completely consistent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.827" offset="4727777">The Christiana people are giving up Du Pont stock and they are getting Du Pont stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.925" offset="4768215">Similarly, the reorganizations under Chapter 10 of the Bankruptcy Act have that same test of equitable equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.905" offset="4796113">One of the cases under Chapter 10, the Central States Electric Corporation case, is very, very much in point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.152" offset="4829132">Central States at that time had as its two principal assets two closed-end investment companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.816" offset="4867793">In the Advisory Report of the Commission, they went into this question of how should they be valued; according to what the stock of these subsidiary companies were selling for in the market, or according to what their holdings were selling for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.238" offset="4933413">It made a difference of close to $4 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.922" offset="4948146">The Commission determined that it was what their portfolio securities sold for in working out the value of this company for reorganization purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.054" offset="4988688">The District Court accepted the Commission’s recommendation and the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, quoting much of the language of the Commission’s report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.499" offset="5034455">It said, “The proper method of valuing the assets of an investment company such as this is the presently realizable market values of the securities on hand”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.373" offset="5081998">It was referring to the holdings of these subsidiary investment companies, almost $4 million more than the market value of their own stocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.552" offset="5126719">Similarly here of course it is the market value of Christiana’s holdings that is basic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.045" offset="5164649">I would like finally to refer to the case of Pepper v. Litton, which our opponents in the Court below cited against us, which is sort of odd since that is one of the cases that I think in most our briefs we were relying on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.443" offset="5222223">It cited from Mr. Justice Douglas’ language about arm’s length bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.644" offset="5243121">But in the Pepper case, a person who owned his one-man corporation was using it to defraud creditors, and in fact did so greatly to the creditor’s injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.246" offset="5305501">Unlike the Pepper case, as we have seen here, no one has been injured by this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.036" offset="5332669">More importantly, the Pepper case was a protest against a fiduciary utilizing what Mr. Justice Douglas referred to as his strategic position for his own preferment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.554" offset="5390765">Section 17 treats affiliates of an investment company in a position that is certainly comparable to that of the fiduciary relationship, to the investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.419" offset="5446144">So here we have the respondents claiming that there should have been arm’s length bargaining so that they can in effect hold up Christiana’s shareholders and require them to hand over something approaching $200 million of their company’s Du Pont stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.510" offset="5534543">As the Commission pointed out, a principal reason why Section 17 of the Investment Company Act requires us to pass upon the fairness of transactions such as this is to prevent persons in a strategic position from using that position to affect transactions for other than fair value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.645" offset="5623046">Surely, it was not unreasonable for the Commission to conclude that fairness does not require that Du Pont use its strategic position to deprive Christiana’s shareholders of several hundred million dollars of their company’s assets.</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Gribbon</label>
            <text syncTime="1406.043" offset="5724714">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.214" offset="5737358">As the members of the Court have already perceived, this case presents none of the tantalizing constitutional issues that are the Court’s usual fare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.293" offset="5773720">Indeed, the transaction under question is a direct response to the vagaries of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.202" offset="5801305">If the liquidation of Christiana could be accomplished with the same simplicity and lack of tax consequences that attended its creation 60 years ago, there would be no occasion for this merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1437.429" offset="5850207">Shares of Du Pont stock that Pierre Du Pont and his five associates contributed to Christiana would simply be taken out of the vault, broken up into denominations appropriate to be distributed to their successors in interest; the 8,000 shareholders of Christiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.899" offset="5916140">But, the taxes consequences, and particularly the complexities of determining Christiana’s accumulated earnings and profits, rule out a simple liquidation of its assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.455" offset="5962324">Paradoxically however, essentially the same result can be accomplished through a merger with Du Pont, and not I might say because of any quirk or technicality in the merger law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.240" offset="6013420">Mergers are tax-free because they involve only a change in the form rather than in the substance of an investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.635" offset="6042990">This fits that and has been ruled to be a tax-free merger by the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.278" offset="6069635">Now, the terms of the merger as have been stated call for Du Pont to issue about 13.2 million shares of its own stock, and to receive in turn from Christiana about 13.4 million shares and miscellaneous assets, valued at about $26 million net.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.589" offset="6138807">Now, these terms reflect, as Mr. Ferber has shown, what has been referred to as Net Asset Value, that is, the shares of Du Pont stock which represent 98% of Christiana are valued in exactly the same way as the shares of Du Pont stock which Du Pont is going to issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.844" offset="6207875">It is my understanding that the respondents contend that even if, as Mr. Ferber has shown, the Commission is justified in saying that presumptively Net Asset Value should be used in determining the terms of merger between an investment company and its operating affiliate, but nonetheless, there are two special considerations in this case that dictate a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.212" offset="6289377">Now, those two considerations are: First, a sharing of benefits contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.246" offset="6309439">It is clear from the terms and has been recognized that the Christiana shareholders will receive greater benefits than the Du Pont people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.426" offset="6338174">The second reason why it is said that the Net Asset Value should not control is an apprehension that the merger will cause a significant adverse market impact in the value of the Du Pont stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.037" offset="6396688">These are the two contentions I propose to deal with, and I believe that an understanding of a little of the background of this transaction maybe helpful in viewing those two contentions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.837" offset="6439842">When Christiana proposed a merger, the Du Pont management considered it and concluded that such a transaction would cause no detriment to Du Pont Company or its stockholders and would bring about certain significant benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.235" offset="6489475">Now, the principal benefit that the management saw was the dispersion of the block of Du Pont’s stock, some 28% of Du Pont, presently in the hands of Christiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1606.468" offset="6526360">That dispersion, in the view of the management, would remove that block as a target for people, unlike Christiana, who are inexperienced in the chemical business and who might do harm or threaten to do harm to Du Pont.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.873" offset="6575993">Now, I recognize that the Commission was less than greatly impressed by the magnitude of that benefit, but that benefit as far as the Du Pont management was concerned, was and remains the basic reason for this transaction from Du Pont’s viewpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.452" offset="6634298">The Commission did agree completely that the transaction would have no detriment to Du Pont or its shareholders, and the Court of Appeals took no exception to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.140" offset="6669093">Both the Commission and the Court agreed that in general the elimination of companies such as Christiana was in the public interest in terms of corporate democracy and elimination of proliferation of holding companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.031" offset="6724577">Now, in connection with the merger, both Christiana and Du Pont sought outside legal and financial guidance as to the terms upon which a merger would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.760" offset="6763552">Both of them were advised independently that the established practice in the merger of investment companies into their operating affiliates was that the terms represent Net Asset Value with perhaps a discount premium of modest amount depending upon individual circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.260" offset="6829589">Now, an exhibit prepared by one of the advisors, which appears at 687 of the record, collects in short form the ten most comparable transactions that had occurred; six of them had been approved by the Commission, and four of them had not been approved by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.526" offset="6894582">The important thing, and this it is unchallenged, that this is an accurate statement of prior practice in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.429" offset="6926242">Every one of those transactions was done at Net Asset Value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.820" offset="6947767">Now, what this background suggests, indeed shows I submit, is that the merger terms were developed with the assistance of outside financial and legal guidance in an effort by both sides to arrive at what terms would first reflect established financial practice, and second, reflect the decision of the Commission under Section 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.778" offset="7035643">The ultimate authority of the Commission to find out whether these terms were fair, reasonable, or reflected overreaching was recognized from the outset of the negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.912" offset="7072110">There was never any attempt to put anything over on anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.712" offset="7087366">Now, the fact that these merger negotiations were carried out in this manner may not necessarily be the end of the inquiry and I do not suggest it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.663" offset="7119131">I do say that it is the complete answer to the charge that respondents make, which was accepted in part by the Court of Appeals, that Messrs. McCoy and Shapiro on the Du Pont side laid down and played dead for their Christiana masters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.255" offset="7173570">The fact is that the terms that they obtained for Du Pont turned out to be the most favorable terms for Du Pont that the Commission would have approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.660" offset="7211186">The Commission specifically said it would not have allowed anything to be significantly better than the terms that Messrs. McCoy and Shapiro got for Du Pont in these negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.525" offset="7250579">Let me turn now to the benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1819.046" offset="7376698">It is at the bottom of Page 35, on the top of Page 36 in the Appendix on petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.951" offset="7408254">These benefits are of two kinds: First, the 7% inter-corporate dividend tax that Christiana now pays as a corporation is obviously going to be eliminated when it ceases to be a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.730" offset="7455379">In addition, the market value of the Du Pont stock, which the Christiana shareholders receive, will be higher than the present market value of the Christiana stock which they hold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.404" offset="7498115">The reason being that they are permitted by doing through a merger to get that stock in their hands and defer the taxes that would be payable had they received that stock through a liquidation at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.435" offset="7542210">So we have a combination of a saving of the 7% tax and a deferral of the tax that might be payable were this done through a liquidation rather than through a merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.419" offset="7586200">The Commission refused to direct the sharing of these benefits, essentially for the same reason that it felt that the Investment Company Act required it to look to Net Asset Value in these transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.997" offset="7632489">Sharing of benefits here is really a euphemism for dividing what belongs to Christiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.000" offset="7656522">They said, the Commission, the objective of the Investment Company Act was to protect investment company’s shareholders and not to take things away from them, and therefore, we do not regard it as fair to have any significant division of the property values of the Christiana shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.873" offset="7731963">In substance, the shareholders of all investment companies, when they come to dispose of their assets are in essence wards of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.870" offset="7768012">It is the Commission that makes the final determination as to the terms on which they are going to be able to sell, and the Commission had very much in mind that it was the protection of investment company shareholders, even though some of them maybe wealthy and even though they may carry the name Du Pont, they are the ones that are protected under the Investment Company Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2293.945" offset="9276322">Now, what of the Commission’s unanimous approval after an evidentiary hearing and 15 months of deliberation, I ask whether there is any rational basis for believing that this public, non-partisan body, with the full support of its extensive staff, with full knowledge of Christiana’s long relationship with Du Pont, failed either wittingly or unwittingly to balance the interest of the 225,000 public Du Pont stockholders against the interest of the many few Christiana shareholders?</text>
            <text syncTime="2326.165" offset="9405158">On the contrary, there is every reason to conclude that the Commission gave the transaction the very unbiased scrutiny which the Court of Appeals said was intended by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.759" offset="9447581">And finally, a Federal District Court, after an extended evidentiary hearing, has given the transaction its blessing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.955" offset="9476316">What then is there on the other side that suggests doubt as to the correctness of the Commission’s informed judgment?</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.706" offset="9503274">Two things: first, the unsupported claims of two out of Du Pont’s 225,000 stockholders, with no particularly relevant experience, that Du Pont should exact a heavy price for cooperation in determination of Christiana’s existence; and second, concurrence in that view by two members of the reviewing Court who found it highly significant and important enough to observe that the Du Pont family, not Christiana, but the Du Pont family, had for many years retained the economic, political, and social advantages that a company control of one of America’s largest enterprises.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.835" offset="9659800">To what extent that entered into their opinion is not clear, but it was important enough that they made specific mention, something like a bill of retainer (ph).</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.312" offset="9697730">I submit that weighed against these two considerations, the Commission’s informed judgment stands clean and untarnished and is wholly acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.613" offset="9742974">I should now like to turn to the contention of the respondent Murtaugh.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.007" offset="9756558">He alone asserts as a reason for rejecting the merger terms or indeed for prohibiting the merger, an apprehension that the merger will have a serious adverse impact on the market value of Du Pont stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.791" offset="9803682">Now, the Commission gave this contention the most careful consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.473" offset="9818415">The entire evidentiary hearing in substance was taken up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.710" offset="9843389">What that hearing disclosed was that the Murtaugh contention rests upon market impact concerns that were expressed with respect to certain plans having to do with Du Pont’s divestiture of General Motors stock pursuant to the order of this Court in the early 1960s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.282" offset="9909635">The Commission correctly found that this merger and the General Motors divestiture have nothing in common.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.685" offset="9943281">There were two essential characteristics of the General Motors merger that gave rise to the apprehension that it would have an adverse impact on the value of the General Motors stock:</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.494" offset="9982464">The first of these were that substantial sales of the General Motors stock each year, over a period of ten years, were ordered by the Court, creating a very substantial overhang for a ten-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.535" offset="10034605">The second essential characteristic was that there was bound to be substantial unorganized selling by the individual shareholders of Du Pont who would be receiving the General Motors stock as a dividend, taxable at ordinary income tax rates, that the record showed would average at about 60%.</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.020" offset="10108584">It was thus these two characteristics; fore selling and tax selling, which did give rise to reasonable apprehension of market impact, and were one of the factors that led to legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2513.298" offset="10153723">This transaction is entirely tax-free.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.243" offset="10165426">Nobody has to pay any taxes, nobody has to sell any stock to raise any money to pay taxes, and there is no required selling by Court order or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.204" offset="10201266">Indeed, the record shows and the Commission found that there are strong reasons here for suggesting that holding for investment rather than selling will be the course followed by the former Christiana shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.947" offset="10252257">Du Pont is an issue of prime investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.025" offset="10260616">They have been holding it in substance for many years and they have no occasion to consider a change in their investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.683" offset="10283186">The owners of about 70% of the stock, the record shows, have no intention of selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.854" offset="10303875">Over half of the Christiana stock is, for all practical purposes, locked in because the holders have either no basis or zero basis as a result of the distribution of the General Motors stock, that locked-in position being a substantial disincentive to any kind of selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.263" offset="10377540">About 75% of the Christiana stock is held by affiliates of Du Pont who can dispose of substantial amounts only in carefully regulated transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.599" offset="10418918">Now, the Commission went on to say, even if we assume with Murtaugh that there will be some substantial selling, we nonetheless feel that it is inappropriate for us at the Commission to attempt to predict what the stock market behavior is going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.538" offset="10478687">It did that for basically two reasons: First, the merger would not alter Du Pont’s investment quality in the slightest, and no effect on its earnings, on its assets, or on its prospects, so there would be no effect there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2608.069" offset="10532812">The second was that everybody would be free to follow his own personal interests because there would be no uneconomic factors that would cause either buying or selling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.852" offset="10567921">In these circumstances, the Commission concluded that it should not attempt to speculate on stock market behavior in determining the fairness of this transaction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2704.346" offset="10917857">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.440" offset="10938233">The first point that I would like to make is that the question before this Court is whether the Commission should have given significant notice to both the Market Value and the Net Asset Value of Christiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.393" offset="11038020">Repeatedly, in the briefs that have been filed by my opponents, the question is presented as though the Commission should have made a choice between either the Net Asset Value or the Market Value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.207" offset="11117328">I believe that the question is a choice of using both of them and arriving at a verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.123" offset="11152959">I go back to my letter of October 27th, I believe, 1972, which appears at the end of the Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.042" offset="11192665">I wrote to the Commission in answer to their request for any objections to the transaction and I said, that in my opinion, after considering the fact that Christiana had consistently sold at a 20-25% discount, that I believed the terms should be done on a 10% basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.975" offset="11300394">That to me is saying that both the Net Asset Value and the Market Value have a material meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.454" offset="11346265">Now, this case involves both economics and law, and I believe that we should have an understanding of the different types of economic systems that the country can operate under.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.813" offset="11411780">You have first a capitalist system which is laissez-faire and money counts exclusively and the man with the most money has power and the ownership of the means of production are in private hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.696" offset="11479281">Another system completely opposed to that would be a socialist system, where all of the means of production are owned by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.395" offset="11518047">In either of these two systems, I submit that this case would not have arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.678" offset="11543229">But there is a third system which I believe prevails today in this country, and that is a middle-of-the road system, whereby there is government intervention to balance the powers that are controlled by private people, and that generally speaking, the government intervention that has taken place in this country has been intervention on the part of the weak as opposed to the strong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.917" offset="11672169">You have the Anti-Trust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.650" offset="11687111">You have the Public Utility Holding Company laws that are generally, I believe, written with the philosophy of putting restraints on individual powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2909.522" offset="11738624">Now, getting down to this specific Act of 1940, one provision of the Investment Company Act says that the ownership of 25% or more of the voting stock is presumed to be controlled, unless the Commission finds to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3169.816" offset="12779761">The man with the 15 shares out of the 28 in the holding company immediately has control of 28 shares.</text>
