            <label>Mr. Garland R. Rolling</label>
            <text syncTime="57.182" offset="329258">Mr. Chief Justice and members of the court, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.400" offset="346081">My name is Garland Rolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.200" offset="353291">I am here on behalf of the petitioner, Harry Roberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.948" offset="376279">Harry Roberts was a young 19-year-old black lad who was convicted by the Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans for the killing of a police officer under statute RS 14:30 which was a mandatory death penalty statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.221" offset="437405">Part of which has been approved in the prejudice to this case, Stanislaus Roberts v. Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.100" offset="464886">I find myself in a rather unique position of having to call the court's attention, a possible jurisdictional problem on a writ that I applied for, in occurrence with 28 USC 1257.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.684" offset="523191">If it may please the court, Harry Roberts’ case was argued and submitted in the Supreme Court of Louisiana.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.835" offset="559867">The death sentence was affirmed and re-hearing was applied before it was denied during the 90-day writ period across the Stanislaus Robert's case came down from this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.594" offset="610858">It was too late to have any further hearings before the State Court, so we want to have with the writs of particular court.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.095" offset="636876">I am concerned that if, it may please the court that had the Louisiana Supreme Court had the benefit of Stanislaus Roberts at the time they decided Harry Roberts possibly a different result would have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.962" offset="688285">Stanislaus Robert, as you know, struck down Section 1 of the RS 14:30 statute, the mandatory death penalty for the killing during an armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.963" offset="728305">This maybe merely academic to question of the finality of judgments because certainly if the Supreme Court of the United States sends us back to Supreme Court of Louisiana, the state or the individual could apply for writs and be backed up here in six months to a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.556" offset="794656">But I did not want to cross the Court’s intention to whatever consideration they may want to give it.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.128" offset="812941">The second and more basic consideration that we are asking the court for, on behalf of Harry Roberts are the procedural objections that we have to the manner of the coaching of the first-degree murder statute in Louisiana which of course has been re-amended and re-affirmed since the decisions in Proffitt v. Florida and Gregg v. Georgia, and the up cases which came down sometime ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.515" offset="926522">The statute provides, of course, the built-in aggravated circumstance of killing a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.324" offset="953794">It would have been interesting in the outcome of this case, if we could have presented the various mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.586" offset="986812">One particular instance is about the case is the defendant took the witness stand on his own behalf and he is continually and vividly denied his guilty in this case, and said it was a case of misidentification.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.701" offset="1039266">There was evidence both ways, the jury resolved the facts against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.979" offset="1060373">There were numerous mitigating circumstances on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.190" offset="1073226">The boy had a long juvenile record, he had a problematical home, he had a long history of mental problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.579" offset="1110842">Possibly, if we would have an opportunity to present this to the jury and accordance with those standards set forth in Gregg v. Georgia and the other cases, we would have a different results here, we would not have the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.993" offset="1156399">The state kept the benefit of the one aggravating circumstance which was resolved against the defendant but the defense did not have the benefit of the many, many mitigations circumstance which we were not allowed to present.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.307" offset="1205719">Concerned about the whole question of cruel and unusual punishment and I may take them the minority view, quite frankly.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.057" offset="1236752">I personally feel that cruel and unusual punishment by giving someone life imprisonment is far more severe than putting someone to death in a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.151" offset="1265069">If I had the choice, I would much rather be put to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.456" offset="1278339">I am deeply concerned about the Johnson Washington Case which has not been bound into the United Reports wherein my good friend, Ado Berry(ph) who resides at St. Charles Parish and who was a police officer was shot down and killed and his assailant was given life imprisonment by this court less than six months ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.256" offset="1365483">When the court here held that the killing of the Deputy Sheriff did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.721" offset="1391397">I beg your pardon, the killing of a Deputy Sheriff, requires a life sentence and to put him to death would be cruel and unusual punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.434" offset="1418251">This is just several months ago by this Court and the case of course, Johnson Washington, cited right here in my brief, and it rose -- the two killings arose less than 10 miles apart in two different parishes in the same state.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.624" offset="1474989">And it is very difficult for me to understand now how a few months later, Harry Roberts could be possibly jeopardize to...</text>

            <text syncTime="373.622" offset="1594943">The jury can reach different results but the Supreme Court of the United States should not reach different results, if it may please the court, three months apart, whereas, say, where one man can be put to death in March 1977 and one man gets life in December 1976.</text>

            <text syncTime="701.873" offset="2907962">We feel that he is waived all of this by applying for certiorari and particularly after this court issued its narrowing order on November 28th saying it's a sole issue before the court on this grant of certiorari would be limited to the constitutionality of the mandatory death penalty for intentional killing of a police officer under the Louisiana first-degree murder law, this court said it.</text>

            <text syncTime="856.094" offset="3524870">That is the difference between the second paragraph of Article 30 and the first paragraph under which Stanislaus Roberts had been convicted which was a felony murder doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.971" offset="3564367">Therefore the citing of Stanislaus Roberts for the dismissal of the -- for the setting aside of the imposition of the death penalty in Johnson Washington just was not in point because Stanislaus Roberts deals with the first section of Article 30 which is a broad, sweeping, felony murder statute which says that anyone who commits a murder while engaged in the commission of a resided number of felonies like arm robbery shall be mandatorily sentenced to this.</text>

            <text syncTime="932.900" offset="3832070">I think I said that if this court did not grant a re-hearing in Stanislaus Roberts, the State of Louisiana probably could not execute Harry Roberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.045" offset="3868641">That is what I said in my application.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.998" offset="3876478">No doubt about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.313" offset="3881702">Then this court granted certiorari and two weeks later announced this order, that the issue for decision in this case on certiorari before this court would be the constitutionality of the mandatory death sentence on the Louisiana Law for the intentional killing of a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.742" offset="3959443">Now, the State of Louisiana believes that this case can be very easily distinguished from the Stanislaus Roberts case.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.959" offset="3992357">Article 30 of the Louisiana Criminal Code before it was amended last Summer following this courts Gregg, et. al decisions provided that first-degree murder is the killing of human being.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.271" offset="4041572">Now the first sub-paragraph of that article was the Stanislaus Roberts’ case, the felony murder doctrine which this court threw out in Stanislaus Roberts.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.242" offset="4081487">The second paragraph is the one under which the present case and Johnson Washington was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.975" offset="4112416">When the offender has a specific intent to kill or inflict right bodily harm upon a police officer, who was engaged in the performance of his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.724" offset="4135403">Now, the State of Louisiana’s position is that this is clearly distinguished from the Stanislaus Roberts case because this statute is now withdrawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.064" offset="4176781">It incorporates a statutory aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.467" offset="4194336">It is a State of Louisiana’s position that there are no mitigating circumstances possible when a person intentionally kills a police officer in the performance of his lawful duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.741" offset="4251492">We feel that because of the trial judges’ very careful instruction to the jury in this case in plain everyday language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.265" offset="4285555">The responsive verdicts did not give the jury unfettered discretion and that no appellate review was necessary on the narrow issue of jury capriciousness and so forth by the Louisiana Supreme Court because of the narrow statute that was presented to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.857" offset="4371864">In other words to bring in a verdict of guilty in this case, which would necessarily and mandatorily result in a sentence of death as it did, the jury had to sharply focus on a very narrow set of circumstances that is whether the accused intentionally killed a police officer who was in the performance of his lawful duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.023" offset="4468621">The fact in this case, there could be no clearer facts in such an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.214" offset="4489310">It was a Mardi Gras day in 1974 and Harry Roberts started shooting various people in his neighborhood and wounded a little boy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.929" offset="4528181">The neighbors called the police and officers John Tobin(ph) and Dennis Mclnerney answered the call, dressed in uniform and in a marked police car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.186" offset="4569245">As they approached the scene of the shooting, they were told by a by-stander that the person they wanted was dressed in blue trousers, beige shirt, and was wearing a red cap, he was going over that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.956" offset="4628282">They proceeded in that direction and just turning the car, and they saw Harry Roberts taking a red cap off his head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.244" offset="4653464">They parked their police car at an angle, right in front of Roberts to get out and talk to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.044" offset="4676661">Roberts walked up to the police car and shot Officer Mclnerney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.964" offset="4700380">Officer Tobin, as he sat in the car, Officer Mclnerney jumped out and was shot and mortally wounded by Roberts at this time, died within a few seconds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.259" offset="4745519">Officer Tobin, although wounded was able to draw his service revolver and wound Roberts in the leg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.784" offset="4771642">There upon, Roberts ran off in limping and leaving a trail of blood and took refuge in a neighboring house where he was captured a few minutes later by police officers who were brought to the scene by the wounded officer, John Tobin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.281" offset="4833604">Now, the State feels that if ever there is a factual circumstance posing, presenting the intentional killing of a police officer in the performance of his lawful duty, this is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.823" offset="4883759">Not even any questions to the man, nothing to irritate him or throw him off.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.902" offset="4908106">When he saw the police car stopped, he went up to it and shot the first officer sitting in the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.961" offset="4932347">The second officer killed him as he got out to question him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.216" offset="4949379">The State of Louisiana feels that under this court’s decision in Gregg v. Georgia, Proffitt v. Florida and so forth, Stanislaus Roberts v. Louisiana, in which this court, time and again, in footnotes and in dicta cut out from its opinion narrow, specifically drawn statute which focused on particular circumstances that the jury would have before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.067" offset="5068706">Time and again, this court cut those out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.517" offset="5078528">That is what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.584" offset="5086783">Moreover, this Court in those cases, specifically approved Georgia’s and Florida’s bifurcated jury in which the jury was to consider various circumstances aggravating and mitigating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.558" offset="5146760">One of the aggravating circumstances approved by this court, in those cases was the circumstance which provided which the jury must consider on to Florida and Georgia law and under the uniform criminal codes and that are universally approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.419" offset="5214156">That is that the murderer could -- either during the course of a lawful arrest or that the person intentionally killed was a uniformed police officer or police officer on duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.994" offset="5260445">It elements to the same thing, a peace officer in the performance of his lawful duty, the Louisiana statute presents this very clearly to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.031" offset="5312586">So, it is narrowly drawn, it incorporates an aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.647" offset="5327110">Now, the State of Louisiana takes the position that there are no mitigating circumstances that need to be given to the jury when a police officer on duty is killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.944" offset="5380295">It is as simple as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.512" offset="5386564">If our society is to exist and if one or two policeman are going to control groups of violent people, mobs, and so forth, continually being called to investigate dangerous situations such as we have in the present case, that there are no mitigating circumstances which will excuse a person for gunning down a police officer engaged in the performance of his duty and is therefore, the lack of mitigating circumstances having been presented to the jury in a special sentencing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.368" offset="5549986">Of course, all these mitigating circumstances can always be presented to the jury during the trial on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.657" offset="5579139">In argument to the juries, anything like insanity or drunkenness or youth or first defender can always be presented to the jury in the trial on the merits, it is not as though they don’t hear mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.911" offset="5632115">And State of Louisiana further believes that the responsive verdict system which this court seemed to disapprove of in Stanislaus Roberts, in no way invalidates the present mandatory death sentence because of the trial judge's instructions which we have forwarded to this court, which were not included in the record but we have sent to this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.469" offset="5738381">This court will see that the trial judge very patiently and in everyday language explained to the jury, that first-degree murder and he would be sentenced to death, if you find so and so, if you find that he was not a police officer, second-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.488" offset="5802434">If you find that there was provocation, man slaughter and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.335" offset="5829810">For the same reason, we feel that the lack of appellate review by the Louisiana Supreme Court does not invalidate the mandatory death sentence here either because of the fact that the jury in effect was given such strict guidelines for its deliberations and whether it should bring in a verdict of guilty as charged which would result in a mandatory death sentence that there was no leeway for capriciousness and so forth which this court deplored in Gregg v. Georgia and Stanislaus Roberts and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1622.459" offset="6590287">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.804" offset="6603661">I am Jules E. Orenstein, an Assistant Attorney General of the State of New York of counsel to the amicus curiae in this case, the Honorable Louis J. Lefkowitz, Attorney General of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.699" offset="6647234">We appear here in support of the position of the State of Louisiana and in support of the concept that a mandatory death penalty for the killing of a police officer is constitutionally acceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.301" offset="6709719">Of necessity, our argument must be of an empirical or pragmatic nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.893" offset="6740021">Our starting point, I think, as far as our position is concerned has its genesis and the plurality, Footnote 7, I believe in the case decided last July, in Woodson v. North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.958" offset="6792266">As we read that Footnote and the opinion of the plurality and the comments by other Justices of this court and their dissents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.771" offset="6823612">There was reserve for a future date, the determination of the question whether or not, a unique category of homicidal offense could in certain circumstances justify the imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.024" offset="6888605">We say that the killing of a police officer is another one of those few narrow situations in which the infliction of the death penalty mandatorily will sufficiently justify under today’s contemporary standard, the infliction of this particular death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.522" offset="6974600">Just this last week, within the last week, last Tuesday in regard with the Florida case, there were some words by the plurality in that decision which I think are very pertinent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.385" offset="7018068">This court, plurality opinion stated it is a vital importance to the defendant and the community that any decision to impose this death sentence be and appear to be based on reason rather than caprice or emotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.096" offset="7088912">I think if we had ever had a situation where the death penalty could be imposed mandatorily based upon reason, we have those reasons here in the situation; the limited narrow situation where a police officer has been killed in the line of duty by a person who knew or should have known that the gentleman who he killed was a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.969" offset="7188386">Empirically, we have seen some statistics cited by our fellow amici at the joint, as I term it, the joint law enforcement, amici brief by the National District Attorneys, Association American’s For Law Enforcement, International Conference of Police Chiefs, and the National Sheriffs Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.167" offset="7265186">I think, the thing that really screams and cries out for a ruling of protection for this class of victim, the peace officer, all of the statistics that have been compiled, namely from 1966 through 1975 inclusive, you had 1203 police officers killed in the line of duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.081" offset="7360794">The numbers doubled between 1966, when you had 50 and some odd officers, they went into the 120s and 130s by the time we hit the 70s, I think the latest figure in 1974 was 132, we had a 129 in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.072" offset="7436759">Now, this ought to tell us something.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.868" offset="7451910">We have been speaking in terms and I believe the plurality opinion and most of the opinions of this court, since last July have spoken in terms of the need for the protection of society or the general need to protect society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.041" offset="7500602">But I think here, we have a special category or group which deems it necessary to have a specific protection of that group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.641" offset="7551070">These people are exposed, their exposure is terrible and it is constant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.854" offset="7571864">The figures justify the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.049" offset="7584716">If as this court has stated with regard to the correctional officer that he may be deemed the unique circumstance, if he happens to be killed in the line of duty while guarding some prisoners in a correctional setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.929" offset="7632154">The exposure of those correctional officers is far less than the exposure of the police officer who is in the line of duty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.289" offset="7889617">Well, Your Honor, I do not know what they do in the other states but I know a certain state such as the State I represent, certainly have a problem in the criminal justice field and we certainly have problems which are unique and different not only in the number of crimes committed but in the type of crimes committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.894" offset="7952102">All urban areas, I think, have far greater problem and say a like the state with all do respect to our sister state of Maine, they do not have a situation we have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.490" offset="7986479">They do not have the constant headlines screaming about homicides not only of correctional people or peace officers but ordinary citizens who have been the subject or victim of a homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.848" offset="8047919">I would also like to emphasize and I have set forth certain portions within our brief of the experience factor that certain police officer personnel have experienced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.864" offset="8095985">Now, they say from their experience, statistics aside that when they have talked to possible perpetrators or perpetrators in the past, they have found that the threat of a possible death penalty may very possibly and in fact, in case it has stated that trigger finger or whatever other weapon was to be used from inflicting the assault or murder upon the police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.983" offset="8200370">In addition, I think the statistics of the California and the Joint Law Enforcement amici brief set forth the number of assaults upon police officers, in the year 1975 along which exceeded over 44,000 assaults.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.926" offset="8264213">I think, it was 44,800 and some odd number of assaults close to 45,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.355" offset="8297859">In addition, plurality of this court in the Woodson and the Stanislaus Roberts cases spoke in terms of the fact that there was defective in these courts, in the plurality opinion, the fact that in a mandatory situation, there was no one to really pass upon such -- this nature of the crime, the character or record of the particular defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.500" offset="8410499">Now, I say and we say in this particular situation dealing with law enforcement personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.694" offset="8435263">The nature of the crime speaks for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.610" offset="8446966">You have a police officer; the elements are there, the intentional killing of a police officer on duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.556" offset="8466714">The act itself by the defendant or perpetrator of killing a police officer under these circumstances certainly, gives us an idea as to his character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.296" offset="8509660">Another interesting statistic I think which may feel the gap in the minds of some members of this court with respect to the lack of knowledge of the record of the perpetrator, can be found in those statistics on Page 12 of the amici brief, the Joint Law Enforcement brief, where they set forth a very telling factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.794" offset="8591684">A 1438 persons identified in the killing of law enforcement officers between 1966 and 1975, 76% of them had records of prior encounters with the criminal justice process and of that number 56% had previous records convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.169" offset="8689173">So, taking these factors all together, we are of the opinion that one can harmonize these particular groups of peace officers and their particular situation with the recent July opinions of this court including the plurality opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.633" offset="8770989">We think we can satisfy and have satisfied the fact that these factors are present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.629" offset="8798992">They are built in, they are subsumed by a jury verdict finding a particular perpetrator of not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.155" offset="8833056">New York and many of our jurisdictions, there is fair opportunity to present many of the conventional defenses that one finds in the criminal trial process.</text>

            <label>Mr. Garland R. Rolling</label>
            <text syncTime="2273.553" offset="9194695">As this occurred, I would like to just call the Court's attention on the two factors; one is on the finality of the Johnson Washington case and the re-hearing of the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.498" offset="9238476">I think, if it may please of court, law is that the at the Johnson Washington case is final, when you denied your re-hearing here, it certain supersedes any potential opinion of Louisiana Supreme Court could render.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.959" offset="9284347">I think that Johnson Washington will be in jail for whatever time, the law prescribes but there is no way that this Harry Roberts case will in any way affect Johnson Washington’s case because of your previous denial of a re-hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.023" offset="9332621">I would like to further call the Court's attention on that, have a basic disagreement with my colleague Mrs. Korns on my right under this existing law to submit mitigated circumstances to the jury during the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.209" offset="9385284">There is no way that I could get up there, or any other counsel would get up there and spend four hours before the jury and tell the jury during the course of the guilty or innocence trial, 30 reasons why you should not execute this particular individual without saying look, ladies and gentleman of the jury, this man is guilty and here's why you should not execute him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.512" offset="9466577">In fact, it would not even have a guilty or innocence trial if that was truly prohibited from doing it, unless you want to place yourself in that particular procedural position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.617" offset="9498969">The last thing is, part of it, at my conclusion, all of us are opposed to crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.498" offset="9526450">God only knows, I do not want to see anybody killed particularly police officers or particularly agents of the state or anybody at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.866" offset="9555916">But possibly if we are give it an opportunity to have these sense in hearings which this court has announced as a principal Law Of The Land possibly can get some testimony, possibly can look into the background of some of these criminals, possibly we can find out why Officer Mclnerney was killed, and remember my particular client denied his guilt at all times but possibly we could find out, what is wrong and what we can do as individuals are human beings to correct this people, to prevent this from happening in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.040" offset="9676602">If we do not look into the cause of the crime, we never are going to find out what to do to prevent the crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2398.789" offset="9695619">From the question of the merits which you pressed for the second time, do you challenge Mrs. Korns' statement that your client was trialed right from the place where he shot the police officers and found them in house with the gun?</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.638" offset="9763015">Is that being questioned?</text>

            <text syncTime="2418.895" offset="9776076">My client testified, got on the witness stand, and took the witness stand, and remember this is a 19-year-old uneducated youth versus the full force in effect of the intellect of the Attorney General’s officers in State of Louisiana and matched with the Attorney General for an hour or two hours, and he always said that he was not the one that did it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2448.841" offset="9895821">He was shot in the leg and his testimony was that he was shot in the leg by unknown assailant and he run into this particular house to use the phone to call the police and to call for help.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.107" offset="9944932">Now, the jury resolved the facts against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.343" offset="9953813">I do not know who is right, I do not know who is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.288" offset="9961650">I do not know which facts are correct or which facts are incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.611" offset="9974920">But there was very serious factual dispute in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.438" offset="9986205">We lost, and I can certainly understand how a reasonable man could have resolved the facts against him.Justice,</text>
            <text syncTime="2476.775" offset="10007626">Just as I think a reasonable man could have resolved the facts at his favor and nobody really knew what the jury was going to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.829">But they are against this and that is why we are here.</text>
