            <text syncTime="41.410" offset="266152">This case involves a preliminary injunction against an ongoing State Court preceding, but more specifically the injunction enjoins a State Court proceeding to collect final State Court judgments in the amount of seven-and-a-half million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.665" offset="371165">Final State Court judgment resulting after 10 years of litigation in the Illinois courts, final judgments fully reviewed by the Illinois Supreme Court and unanimously affirmed by that court in a very thorough opinion by Judge Walter Schaefer, and final judgments which this Court declined to review on petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.231" offset="513375">Furthermore, the preliminary injunction was issued by the District Court on precisely the same federal grounds which the state defendants have specifically raised by formal pleading in the state preceding as a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.570" offset="618805">A defense which the State Courts, indeed the Illinois Appellate Court, specifically ruled was within the jurisdiction of the Illinois courts to adjudicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.689" offset="679200">A defense, however, which when the case was then remanded for trial on that defense in the State Trial Court the state defendants, immediately before trial, moved to withdraw the federal antitrust defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.664" offset="763106">That was in 1971, and never again reasserted that federal defense in the state proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.466" offset="818381">I do not think so Your Honor, certainly I could have no effect on the either of the Section 2283 question which we are dealing with today, or comity and federalism questions, because obviously any litigant cannot determine for himself by removing a defense or client without prejudice that whether that shall affect the application of principles of comity and federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.863" offset="959965">I thank that so far as this case is concerned regardless of what may have been the right of the state defendants at some later date in the state preceding to again raise the federal defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.536" offset="1014613">They withdraw that defense without prejudice in 1971 can have no effect for the reason that during the next four years of the State Court proceeding the state defendants never chose to reassert that federal defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="314.339" offset="1357862">The state defendants in there federal case which they have filed after the state proceedings initiated, there is never any information that the state defendants or the federal plaintiffs would ever seek to enjoin the results of the state litigation, but instead every statement by the state defendants or the federal plaintiffs in the federal case was to the effect that if Vendo is successful in its state preceding to recover judgments as it did then the state defendants would seek damages based in part on the State Court proceeding, but not until January 1975 was there ever the slightest intimation, even one word in the record, about obtaining a preliminary injunction against State Court?s decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1130.094" offset="4620869">I would not Your Honor urge that stay of the federal case and indeed at least two circuits, the Second Circuit Alliance case and the Ninth Circuit in Mactronix (ph) have held that in such circumstances this treble damage action in the Federal Court should not be stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.041" offset="4700699">That is not our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.744" offset="4711462">But I would point out that in Alliance case at the same time that Judge Hand held that a stay of the federal case was inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.142" offset="4757019">But in that same case, an attempt was made to enjoin the state judgment and the Second Circuit held, no that was entirely improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.525" offset="4798606">They held that it was barred by Section 2283.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.510" offset="4822534">Now, just so that we understand what the factual situation is, during the period 1959-1964, Mr. Harry Stoner was both the director and officer of Vendo receiving his salary of $50,000 a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.304" offset="4921695">The Illinois Supreme Court held that at that very time while he was on the payroll of Vendo and serving as a director and officer, that Stoner had violated his fiduciary duties through misconduct of the most flagrant sort by secretly organizing and financing another vending machine manufacturer, by secretly developing a new type of machine which Vendo itself had been venally trying to develop, by deceitfully misrepresenting Stoner?s relationship with the new company, and by misappropriating a corporate opportunity rightfully belonging to Vendo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.807" offset="5083759">The Illinois Supreme Court in its opinion by Judge Schaefer affirmed the judgments on the basis of those violations of fiduciary duties quite apart - it should be noted - quite apart and regardless of court said, if any liability that might be imposed based on the non competition governance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.222" offset="5169336">After the Illinois Supreme Court denied rehearing, this Court denied certiorari in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.811" offset="5199743">Now, in 1975, these judgments were clearly final.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.809" offset="5227746">They clearly were entitled to full faith and credit, and they were, if anything, overwrite for collection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.762" offset="5267556">Towards that end, Vendo had commenced supplementary proceedings in the State Court to collect these judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.017" offset="5296500">Now, in an effort to stop those proceedings the state defendants sought stays from Illinois Supreme Court, the Illinois Trial Court, the Illinois Appellate Court, and then Mr. Justice Rehnquist as Circuit Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.092" offset="5352820">All these stays were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.480" offset="5362433">Then at that point, the state defendants turned to the Federal District Court and obtained a preliminary injunction here in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.443" offset="5402244">The injunction prohibits taking any further steps to enforce or collect or attempt to enforce or collect the final state judgments and specifically refers to these supplementary proceedings pending in the State Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.037" offset="5460654">Preliminary injunction was sought on two grounds: One ground was that the respondents had allegedly been denied due process in the state proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.739" offset="5499419">The other as I mentioned was this antitrust issue which had been specifically raised in the State Court, specifically held by Illinois court to be within their jurisdiction, and then specifically withdrawn before trial by the state defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.159" offset="5557098">In its decision the District Court held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider to due process issue on the ground that only this Court has jurisdiction to review a final state judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.863" offset="5607984">Nevertheless, the District Court granted the injunction on the antitrust claim on the ground that the Illinois Supreme Court had not passed on the antitrust issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.738" offset="5647481">Notwithstanding, in fact, that the only the Illinois Supreme Court had not passed on the issue Was because the state defendants had deliberately withdrawn that issue and refused to reassert it at any time thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.117" offset="5708921">Now, I have emphasized very briefly, if it please the Court, what I think the principal issues are and we have canvassed those issues in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.391" offset="7462051">You will pardon me a moment?</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.248" offset="7501444">There are few matters that I would like to get clarified having listened to the argument of my distinguished friend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.643" offset="7559018">One was his representation that just last a few months ago before His Honor Judge Will (ph) that we had admitted before him that regardless of what this Court decides does not make any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.184" offset="7653267">Now, for some reason or other he left out a very important passage that appeared in the transcript of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.564" offset="7714707">I have the transcript here, and what he left out was the statement that I made immediately following the statement that Mr. Baker said, ?That is right?, I said ?they do?.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.214" offset="7793388">They say they are not trying to interfere with the prosecution of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.333" offset="7821809">All they are doing is trying to keep us from getting an injunction to keep this case alive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.179" offset="7857232">That is all it amounts to, and I have some question with respect to with all deference again to my distinguished friend, the propriety according a record like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.649" offset="7919089">Now, they have got two supplements in this Reply Brief of theirs. One is supplement A which is the statement of Stoner given to the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.200" offset="7985336">All that was before His Honor Judge McLaren and that is supposed to be a dispositive of something, I do not know what, but it was all before Judge McLaren.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.997" offset="8036432">Now, supplement B is a supplement to their Reply Brief, the trust of which is that we thwarted the prosecution of this case by our dilatory tactics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.728" offset="8119396">Now, we had in our brief what you?re his Honor Judge McLaren said and what they have assured the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.397" offset="8150116">We had before the Circuit Court of Appeals a supplement and I have what here which sets forth the entire history of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.188" offset="8209258">Now, I desire a supplement to their Reply Brief that certainly seems to me that they should have appended the supplement that we appended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.100" offset="8260876">What do we find in that supplement, if the court will part me from reading it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.257" offset="8289506">Now, this is Mr. Slager statement to the Trial Court on February 10th 1971, we do want to get it tried as soon as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.027" offset="8376546">There is a Federal case if they seem to be able to move ahead on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.321" offset="8397757">I realize it is the motion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.085" offset="8408833">It is not like a trial but they have accrued that one firm is handling it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.422" offset="8434224">It seems like they are all in a record, but they are able to move ahead on that but not this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.192" offset="8477274">Now, again with all deference, it seems to me perfectly obvious that what His Honor Judge McLaren said in this record with respect to the fact that the parties had agreed that the federal case would await the final determination of the state proceedings, and that was evidenced by the proceedings before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.872" offset="8604020">They agreed to a standby order so he could pass upon the propriety of our application for a preliminary injunction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2447.835" offset="9891857">Well the reasons why they made him a director, he was to serve as a director without pay.</text>

            <text syncTime="2476.037" offset="10004601">He examined those proceedings for the purpose of determining whether or not Vendo prosecuted them as a part of an anticompetitive scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.954" offset="10060294">When you examine a record -- and we are not seeking to impeach that record in the slightest, but when you do examine that record you will find that the evidence upon which he based, the record on which he based, the statement that Stoner has violated his fiduciary duty, because Vendo did not have a genuine opportunity to purchase the Lektro-Vend machine was completely without support in that State Court record, and that State Court record did not mention at all the fact that Stoner had warned Vendo that their failure to purchase the Lektro-Vend machine was a serious mistake, and add to which in the record before the Judge McLaren.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.230" offset="10285365">When the federal depositions came in it became even more conclusive that at no time that Vendo ever wanted to purchase the Lektro-Vend machine and all time they thought that Lektro-Vend machine was completely too expensive to operate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2644.658" offset="10679083">Examining that record, carefully examining that record, he found that Section 1 was violated by those non-competitive agreements, those contracts violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and he found evidence tending to show that they have violated Section 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.064" offset="10784722">Now, there was of plenty of evidences to support that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2681.278" offset="10825578">We had the first case where they sued to enforce those covenants which violated the Sherman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2732.035" offset="11028601">So that was part of the 10-year marathon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.678" offset="11043230">So, we continue with this 10-year marathon, and the second time we are confronted with the proposition that he was responsible for the fact that they did not have that FIFO machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.723" offset="11127344">Now, if there is any thing more conclusive in this record that there was absolutely no evidence upon which to base that claim, and that they knew or should have known certainly at the time they filed a lawsuit back in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.072" offset="11224729">Whether that charge was true they should have asserted all charges they had against him, and this evidence shows also that his is not the first time they used the judicial process for purposes other than what I consider at least to be a legitimate purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2917.225" offset="11769434">I am mind full of that, but here is what Mr. Justice Stewart said in the Younger case, in such circumstances the reasons of policy for differing to state adjudications are outplayed by the injury flowing from the very beginning of the state proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2943.409" offset="11874133">By the perversion of the very process that is supposed to provide vindication, and by the need for speedy and effective action to protect federal rights.</text>

Foster whether an act of Congress clearly creating a federal right or remedy enforceable in a Federal Court of equity, could be given its intended scope only by a stay of the state court proceedings.?</text>

            <text syncTime="3775.443" offset="15202237">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.513" offset="15210492">In those three minutes, I would like to make three very brief points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.167" offset="15233166">First of all with respect to the treble damage suit which is proceeding ahead on the Trial Court, Mr. Sears once again raises the specter that Vendo, if allowed to collect these judgments will obtain control of these two corporations which Stoner controlled, Lektro-Vend and Stoner Investments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3807.358" offset="15329924">At the District Court, at the Court of Appeals, and now in the Supreme Court of United States, we wish to make clear that Vendo will not obtain control and indeed, consent judgments to that effect were offered in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.870" offset="15395961">So far as taking control of those two companies, so that somehow there would be laws of Article III jurisdiction by virtue case or controversy, there simply is no issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.424" offset="15438175">It is at most a red herring which obscures the fact that the respondents do have their treble damage remedy, they are proceeding ahead, there is no danger that those two companies will be taken over by Vendo, Vendo does not wish to have those two companies, and they have that very adequate remedy, indeed their claim has been that in the treble damage case, they will be able to recover three times the amount of the judgment, whether collect it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.090" offset="15572863">We of course do not act in that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.210" offset="15589372">Second, I would like to very tersely amplify my answer to a series of questions of Mr. Justice White directed to me, after talking with my colleagues it appears that I may have not answered all aspects of Mr. Justice White?s question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.243" offset="15677457">Mr. Justice White asked whether there would be any question other than 2283 if the respondents had not withdrawn their federal antitrust defense and had actually litigated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3911.452" offset="15746316">I think I replied that there would indeed be a significant comity federalism issue in terms of collateral stopple, and what the impact of that adjudication would be in the federal preceding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3924.430" offset="15798247">Furthermore, if they had never raised the defense in the state proceeding and simply had ignored it, there would a significant question Your Honor under the Huffman case with respect to the propriety of an injunction against the State Court proceeding, if it is true that there is an adequate opportunity to have presented that question in the state proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3980.742" offset="16023423">In this instance, we are talking only about a comity federalism bar to an injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3989.362" offset="16057904">We are not, in any sense, taking the position that they are precluded from maintaining their treble damage remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3997.077" offset="16088833">Finally, third point, one of the really key issues here, the threshold issue, I think is the 2283 issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.137" offset="16129062">We have not had an opportunity to review that issue as fully as we should.</text>
            <text syncTime="4011.995" offset="16148497">We urge review of our briefs particularly with respect to what we believe to be the utter distortion of the Mitchum decision and the fact that adoption of the decision below, with respect to the expressly authorized exception, would apply to literally dozens of federal statutes which we have set forth at Pages 10 and 11 of our Reply Brief, which are in every respect identical to Section 16 of the Clayton Act for purposes of obtaining injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4046.822">Thank you very much.</text>
