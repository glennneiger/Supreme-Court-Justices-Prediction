            <text syncTime="57.250" offset="329467">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.627" offset="342946">I represent the petitioner here in Sheriff Claudio Castaneda of the Hidalgo County Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.058" offset="368755">In March of 1972, State District Judge Hose Alamia, a Mexican-American residing on Ninety-second District court of Hidalgo County Texas, selected five persons to serve as grand jury commissioners for that term of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.676" offset="447227">Three of those five persons were of Mexican-American or Spanish-American dissent.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.743" offset="479410">Those five commissioners in turn selected 20 persons to serve as potential grand jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.694" offset="515250">This list of 20 persons is known in Texas as the grand jury panel or list, or pool.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.797" offset="547642">But the person that summoned those 20 persons to open court to be in panel later by Judge Alamia is the petitioner herein, Sheriff Claudio Castaneda.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.613" offset="598946">Ten out of the 20 persons chosen by the Grand Jury Commissioners of the Mexican-American, ten were Anglo-American.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.962" offset="640324">Three Mexican-Americans that were to be served by Sheriff Castaneda, could not be located.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.148" offset="669059">One was listed on the return of the settlements as being out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.999" offset="692465">Two Anglo-Americans, shown by the record, were excused by the court prior to the formal empanelment of March 16, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.830" offset="739799">On March 16th, in 1972, Judge Alamia empanelled the grand jury panel in Open Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.194" offset="769265">One of the Mexican-American at that time was absent for the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.220" offset="789327">13 persons showed up, five Mexican-Americans have been absent, out of state or could not be found by Sheriff Castaneda.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.567" offset="830705">Two Anglo-Americans had already been excused by the court leaving 13 persons to be in panel.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.753" offset="863514">Judge Alamia at that time only needing 12 persons to serve on the grand jury had his option excusing one person for some sort of an emergency excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.265" offset="905519">One man by the name of Mr. Faulkner, an Anglo-American, has to be excused because he had a business over McAllen, Texas, having to do with a Drugstore.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.694" offset="947211">One Mexican-American by the name of Mr. Cavio(ph) seemed to have more pressing matter, he had a father that was due for heart surgery in Houston the next week and Judge Alamia after considering both excuses, excused the Anglo-American, Mr. Faulkner, and kept Mr. Cavio on the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.200" offset="1025265">That grand jury also, Judge Alamia, that same day on March 16th appointed a Mexican-American that's formed the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.243" offset="1057448">The next day on March 17th, 1972, that particular grand jury consisting of five Mexican-Americans and seven Anglo-Americans indicted the respondent herein for the offense of burglary of a private residence at night with intent to commit rape.</text>
