            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100552">We will hear arguments next in 76-352 Chappelle against Greater Baton Rouge Airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.594" offset="342864">Mr. Adcock, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herschel C. Adcock</label>
            <text syncTime="64.821" offset="359791">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.946" offset="372330">My name is Herschel Adcock and I represent the appellant in this matter E. C. Chappelle, Jr.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.811" offset="399706">This is the case that is before the court on the constitutional issue in that a Louisianaa statute requires the ownership of property assessed within a parish in order for a person to be a member of the airport commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.698" offset="467311">For period of five years, prior to the time the appellant resigned, he was an Executive Director and Secretary of the Greater Baton Rouge Airport District.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.959" offset="524363">Mr. Chappelle was the airport for all intent purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.538" offset="538678">He ran the entire show.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.521" offset="546619">With the airport commission giving him technical advise.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.507" offset="570547">Mr. Chappelle then resigned his position as the Director of the airport and was appointed as a member of the airport commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.293" offset="613701">Shortly, thereafter prior to the time that his appointment ran, East Baton Rouge Parish clerk summarily dismissed Mr. Chappelle from the commission after receiving a legal opinion that sends Mr. Chappelle did not own property assessed in East Baton Rouge Parish that he was not qualified to serve as a commissioner on the airport.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.849" offset="727909">Based upon this notion Mr. Chappelle then filed suit in District Court in Baton Rouge.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.919" offset="756225">Alleging number one that he did meet the qualifications that he did own property that had been assessed in East Baton Rouge Parish and it was proved in Court that he did own property on which he had actually paid taxes, but the Court held the sense this property was not listed on the assessment rules that he had not technically met the requirements to be a member of the airport commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.528" offset="850580">Mr. Chappelle likewise the alternative that the court determine that he did not meet these qualifications raised the issue that the act which required the ownership property was unconstitutional and violation of the equal protection and due process clauses of the United States constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.699" offset="939292">On March 4, 1975; Mr. Chappelle was formerly denied his seat from airport commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.402" offset="970116">On July 23, 1975 Nineteenth Judicial District Court ruled in favor of the City of Baton Rouge stating that indeed he did not have the right to sit on the airport commission because he did not have property assessed in East Baton Rouge Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.692" offset="1047230">Mr. Chappelle then went to the next procedure he asked the Court of Appeal, the First Circuit Court of Appeal sitting in Baton Rouge to review the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.967" offset="1096340">Once again, he urged the equal protection in the process clauses of the United State of constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.502" offset="1126537">Once again, the Court of Appeal aligned to stay up with the District Court stating they own no assessed property and was therefore not qualified to sit as a member of the airport commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.141" offset="1189022">Mr. Chappelle had no direct right of appeal to the Louisiana State Supreme Court but asked the Supreme Court to review this decision by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.264" offset="1237505">The Supreme and a memorandum decision denied the writ with one of the Justices stating that the writ should be granted and he cited the case on which we principally relied Turner v. Fouche.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.642" offset="1303021">We held before the court, we believe three questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.778" offset="1327576">The first one is the case of Turner v. Fouche, does it mandate that this statute in Louisiana that requires the ownership of assessed property, does it mandates this statute destruct in violation of the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.812" offset="1407719">Secondly, the court should determine whether or not this act is in violation of the due process clause in that the requirement of the ownership of assessed property has no reasonable basis as to the qualifications of a person to sit on the airport commission.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="347.836" offset="1491834">What sort of a priority counsel does the Greater Baton Rouge Airport District exercise?</text>
            <text syncTime="353.790" offset="1515657">Does it exercise general governmental authority, or is a kind of specialized district.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="herschel_c_adcock" startTime="358.530" stopTime="365.071">
            <label>Mr. Herschel C. Adcock</label>
            <text syncTime="358.530" offset="1534570">It is a specialized commission that deals with the day-to-day affairs of the airport itself.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="365.071" stopTime="384.147">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="365.071" offset="1560797">Why would not that be governed by those Scheuer and Calero cases which we handed down about three or four years ago, which is I noticed neither partyâ€™s cites in their briefs, where we said in the case of the special improvement district, you have the one man, one board rule and the property requirements did not apply.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herschel C. Adcock</label>
            <text syncTime="384.147" offset="1637074">This body is a public body that sits and actually approves leases and deals with the day-to-day affairs of the airport it is a public appointed body they serve for a given term.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="399.104" offset="1696947">Well these were in that sense public bodies, but I think they were described as kind of special use districts rather than districts having general governmental powers.</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="410.133" offset="1741042">I am not familiar with the cases, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.170" offset="1761208">The third question we think this court should consider is whether or not a citizen has the constitutional right or fundamental right to hold an appointed position?</text>
            <text syncTime="429.712" offset="1819305">That is whether he should have the right to be consider to it an appointment of a public body and whether or not the ownership of property should come into he picture at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.550" offset="1882730">It is our position that at this court, oppose a Louisiana statute that permits the state to stay to require the ownership of assessed property.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.158" offset="1937169">This will just open the door for additional classifications and will completely undermine the protection that citizens have to be considered and appointments to public offices.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="474.726" stopTime="490.582">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="474.726" offset="1999445">Well we have held, we have held just in the past couple of years, residency requirements for running for office of five and ten years in length, how would you distinguish those, if every citizen has a right to be considered for public office?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="herschel_c_adcock" startTime="490.582" stopTime="515.642">
            <label>Mr. Herschel C. Adcock</label>
            <text syncTime="490.582" offset="2062870">The residency requirements can be argued as having a reasonable basis if someone -- if you do not have a residency requirement it would be too difficult for the boarding officials to keep up with citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.716" offset="2135386">You could have someone who would move to one place and vote and to different areas and vote.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="515.642" stopTime="537.658">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="515.642" offset="2163076">Well I am talking about a New Hampshire law, which we upheld about two or three years ago, but does that require 15-year residency requirement before you could run for governed.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.128" offset="2204976">Now that certainly is not based -- that is not kind of time period that should talking about eliminating fraudulent voting and that is just a long term attachment of the state that was required and we upheld it.</text>

          <turn speaker="herschel_c_adcock" startTime="537.658" stopTime="562.998">
            <label>Mr. Herschel C. Adcock</label>
            <text syncTime="537.658" offset="2251161">Okay, the to lay out at a place for a certain period of time, I believe is a rational basis to determine whether someone is qualified to sit in a public position, but to require to that person owns property assessed any parish in order to be considered for a public office is in violation of equal protection laws of the time.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="562.998" offset="2352516">But, it does not have the same motivation or at least something in common with the residency requirement that is an attachment to more or less permanent relationship to the community.</text>

          <turn speaker="herschel_c_adcock" startTime="577.313" stopTime="591.309">
            <label>Mr. Herschel C. Adcock</label>
            <text syncTime="577.313" offset="2409776">I do not believe that the ownership of the property can be considered as inductive of someone having an attachment to a particular area because --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="591.309" offset="2465783">Now he question is whether it is rational for the State of Louisiana to think so?</text>
            <text syncTime="597.852" offset="2491905">Whether thatâ€™s in adequate basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.796" offset="2511654">Well the State of Louisiana apparently addressing this act both that it did have some rational basis, it is our position that it does not that the ownership of property does not make one better qualified to sit as an airport commissioner, especially in light of the facts that we have before the court here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.711" offset="2587305">Here he have an expert in the field of aviation, a man who had run the airport for five years, who had resided in the area for great length of time, yet he was denied a seat on the airport commission because he did not --</text>

            <text syncTime="848.446" offset="3494276">The appellants and the members of their places do have a federal constitutional right to be considered for a public service without the burden of ambitiously discriminatory qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.092" offset="3540879">We submit that this is ambitiously discriminatory qualification that is a qualification that you must meet of owning the property assessed and bear in mind that the lower court did hold that Mr. Chappelle owned the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.027" offset="3616634">It did hold a property as determined Louisiana means either real or personal property, they held that he own property located in East Baton Rouge Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.853" offset="3655922">We are not just talking about land, we are talking about the property, but the mere fact that it was not listed on the assessment row was the issue that the Court of Appeals used in which to uphold the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.344" offset="3721855">We further submit that there is no rational basis for the ownership of property in that there is no -- this does not make a person better qualified be an airport commissioner simply to have his property listed on the assessment rolls, as we pointed out in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1246.437" offset="5086283">It is implicit to my defense before the Court, because we do not call with the Turner case in the way it reads.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.943" offset="5112301">It read the Turner rule, and we then result in a further unwanted intrusion on legislative authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.853" offset="5151902">It should read, and further result in and unwarranted intrusion, because we do not feel like the Turner case was an unwarranted intrusion on the legislative authority of the State of Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.226" offset="5213447">In fact, we embrace the Turner v. Fouche case, and we embrace all of the decisions that stem from that line of jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.176" offset="5261199">Yet, submit to this honorable Court, may it please the court that as has been pointed out by some of the questions already, the case that we have before us does not fall within the ambit of equal protection as said forth in Turner v. Fouche.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.868" offset="5336013">The essential part of the case that the appellants, I truthfully believe have misstated unintentionally of course is that this was a fundamental right, and all of our research indicates that there are a lot of fundamental rights that this Court has set forth; marriage, appropriation, vote, equal voting power, interstate travel, First Amendment rights, all of these are set forth in page eight of appelleeâ€™s brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.351" offset="5485956">Access to the ballot as a candidate is arguable, whether that has ever been clearly annunciated as a fundamental right or not, but there are several cases interpreting it; Bullet v. Carter, Liben v. Parish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.847" offset="5555860">Access to divorce courts, again arguable as to whether that is a fundamental right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.191" offset="5577280">Criminal courts, counsel and transcript, of course, privacy of some types.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.567" offset="5606746">We submit, Mr. Chief Justice and members of the Court, that this is not a fundamental right that Mr. Chappelle had to serve on an appointed Advisory Body, the question was asked I think by Mr. Justice Marshall perhaps as to whether or not this Board of Commissioners had any final authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.297" offset="5717714">The question was referred to me since I have been advising these people for nine years, they do not have any final authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.935" offset="5748225">The Act which we reproduced in its entirety in our brief sets forth the fact that this bodies of authority is essentially of a recommendation level, they recommend to the Parish Council which acts as the Airport District.</text>

            <text syncTime="1454.463" offset="5918335">Now, the way the Act sets up this Commission, it's a two tier process, and I am not intentionally borrowing on Mr. Justice Marshallâ€™s language two tier process in the Mergia case, the Mergia case used that concept, but it is a two tier process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.967" offset="6000359">This Commission after it acts, the council which is a dual sitting body; it sits as a Parish Council, which is a single member districted body that governs the entire Parish and the City, because we have a combine form of government in Baton Rouge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.799" offset="6067651">It recesses as a Parish Council, and then reconstitutes itself with the same membership and so forth as the governing authority of the Airport District.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.515" offset="6110596">So all the decisions that are made by -- resolutions, -- this is all found in the Act, made by resolution of the Commissioner, is either approved, rescinded, or disapproved, or suspended by action of the Parish Council sitting as the Airport District.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.499" offset="6198472">So consequently, we view it as definitely not the type of Board of Commissioners that one is entitled to serve on as a matter of fundamental right.</text>
