            <text syncTime="42.943" offset="272221">Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.741" offset="287476">This case involves the claim of Stencel Aero Engineering Corporation against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.859" offset="319973">The issue in this case is not whether a corporation can sue the United States for the Government’s negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.202" offset="353305">The answer to that is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.343" offset="361873">The United States may be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.686" offset="371277">The issue in this case is rather whether that government’s claim must be barred simply because the damages to the corporation include injuries to serviceman.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.924" offset="416208">Now, the issue in this case arises in the following factual context.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.921" offset="436165">In 1968, Stencel Aero Engineering Corporation entered into a contract with North American Rockwell Corporation to upgrade an ejection system in an F-100D fighter aircraft being used by the Air Force.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.928" offset="496247">In 1973, when Captain John Donham, while flying one of these F-100 fighter aircrafts, had his aircraft catch on fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.361" offset="541909">Donham ejected using the system of Stencel Aero Engineering Corporation and successfully ejected and survived.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.429" offset="578167">However, he was injured and there upon filed a claim against both the United States and Stencel in the Eastern District of Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.179" offset="625187">The Stencel Corporation cross claimed against the United States claiming that the negligence towards the injuries was primarily due to the United States’ negligence in the provision of the requirements, specifications and components which were used by Stencel manufacturing the system which was installed in the aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.957" offset="708361">United States moved to dismiss both the claim of Donham and the claim of Stencel.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.664" offset="731140">The district court granted both motions on the grounds that Feres versus the United States, a decision of this court controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.421" offset="766144">Donham did not appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.490" offset="774503">Stencel did.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.323" offset="781817">It appealed to the United States Court of Appeals, the eighth circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.522" offset="794565">However, the circuit court affirmed the decision of the district court.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.787" offset="935626">The review of the briefs in this case indicates that the United States does not really dispute that the claim of Stencel is within provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.167" offset="985155">The government complains about the ramifications of the pie or rather the ramifications of committing Stencel’s claim in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.661" offset="1027160">The government does not dispute that the language of the Federal Tort Claims Act, in sweeping, in broad terms includes the claim of Stencel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1446.162" offset="5885099">The government, however, fears that a decision in favor of Stencel in this case would involve the orders of a field commander and place his judgment and impair his judgment in the exercise of his duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.093" offset="5944867">However, if a field commander’s order is involved in a case, it is not involved in this case, but if it is involved in another case, and I was defending the defendant, I would make sure that that field commander would be brought into court by subpoena deposition as another method and I would confront in that suit, the plaintiff Donham and his military commander.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.668" offset="6043192">So, that if the government is afraid of confrontation as I think this court was concerned in one of its prior decisions, if they are afraid of a confrontation between a field commander and the plaintiff’s serviceman, this suit wants decision against, Stencel will not stop that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.234" offset="6117380">If the government order is relevant, I will bring in the field commander, I will put that order into issue and so the situation as it exists does not -- the denial of Stencel’s claim in this case, does not change that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.231" offset="6185403">The orders of a military commander can be brought into question and the Congress so intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.466" offset="6206405">When the Congress passed the Federal Tort Claims Act, it clearly defined employee to include military serviceman acting in line of duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.909" offset="6240155">It also provided a specific exception that is if the claim arises out of the combating activities of the United States in time of war, the United States cannot be sued and does not waive the sovereign immunity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1627.326" offset="6609840">No other reason, that is correct and we think that the Feres case is simply a case of a serviceman against the United States and even if some commentator say that is really an exception to the Federal Tort Claims Act and it should be treated as an exception and that is as this court has held many, many times, the broad sweeping language indicates a broad way of sovereign immunity and the exceptions to that a broad waiver of sovereign immunity should be narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.631" offset="6726973">It’s the philosophy that has been expounded by this court many, many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.793" offset="6743692">If however, the issue of a field commander’s order does become an issue in the case, if it is that important decision, we believe that Congress has provided, provided for that in the Federal Tort Claims Act, when it provided an exception for discretionary function, that is this is an important decision making and the government is protected in its important government decisions and if a decision we maintain is not important enough to be protected by the discretionary function, then it is not important enough to bar a claim like Stencel’s against the government when the government has the negligent and responsible for the damages that maybe sustained by Stencel in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.370" offset="6933968">Finally, Your Honor, I would like to conclude the ramifications which would occur if Stencel’s claims were denied, Stencel’s claims against United States were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.941" offset="6988302">First of all, there would be a double recovery by Donham because the government would not worry about a double recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.034" offset="7012648">It would not suffer the consequences of a double recovery, but as I mentioned earlier that would stand in the government’s negligence, the government could still under that congressional statute come in and get from Stencel the expenses of the medical expenses incurred in treating Donham.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.713" offset="7095300">The government in this case is in affect saying that with respect to our negligence we are not responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.178" offset="7133230">We want to be immune from the consequences of our act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.830" offset="7147858">On page 12 our brief, in footnote 4, the government quite candidly states, we owe no duty of care to Stencel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.769" offset="7187564">Your Honor, we are saying that government owes a duty of care, just of any private person, every private person, every citizen has an obligation to every other person to exercise, to care.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas S. Martin</label>
            <text syncTime="1847.327" offset="7489749">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.956" offset="7500302">The issue in this case is whether Congress intended that the same litigation that is barred in Feres would be nevertheless be permitted if brought indirectly by a third party plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.564" offset="7554742">In my argument, I would hope to touch briefly upon four principal topics.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.219" offset="7573341">First the similarity between the barred Feres claim and the claim which petitioner seeks to bring in this case by way of indemnity; second, the propriety of applying a Feres immunity against the third party manufacturer has not received compensation; third the limited scope of the immunity that is claimed here by the government and fourth I would like to briefly address our alternative ground for affirming the Court of Appeals decision, namely that indemnity will not be permitted in the absence of liability running from the United States to the injured party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.499" offset="7718477">Now, turning to our first point..</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1906.022" stopTime="1908.260">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1906.022" offset="7724537">Your fourth ground is not a matter of Missouri law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas S. Martin</label>
            <text syncTime="1908.260" offset="7733524">It is not a matter of Missouri law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.576" offset="7738748">It is a matter of federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.131" offset="7748988">Our first point, petitioner’s cause of action we believe is identical in a practical sense to the serviceman’s claim that this court considered and rejected in Feres.</text>
            <text syncTime="1923.369" offset="7793919">Now, in Feres the executive tricks of a serviceman was killed in a barrack’s fire, sought to recover tort damages from the United States, and the claim was that the military had negligently corded troops in barracks with an unsafe heating facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.954" offset="7856299">Now, in Griggs and Jefferson decided with Feres, the claim was that an army doctor had negligently performed medical operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.660" offset="7891094">Contrary to petitioner’s apparent understanding, there was no field commander’s order involved in any of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.566" offset="7918784">In Feres, there was no plaintiff serviceman going to point a finger at his commander.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.068" offset="7944802">Feres had died in the barracks fire that was the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.355" offset="7957863">So, Feres like this case really involved another party stepping into the place of the plaintiff and bringing a particular litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.282" offset="7993599">Now, like petitioners here, the claimants in Feres based their cause of action on the general language of the Tort Claims Act and the absence of any specific exceptions applying to serviceman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.409" offset="8046157">But in Feres the court demonstrated, that in this context, in military context a cause of action cannot be assumed from the general language of the tort claims act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.668" offset="8091192">To find out Congress’ real intent, the court turned to the consequences of the proposed cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.518" offset="8118568">The court saw adverse affects upon military discipline from the litigation of injuries arising out of -- injuries to serviceman under orders and found an additional tort remedy to be inconsistent with the compensation scheme which covered those injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.909" offset="8188159">At last we afforded unlikely that Congress would impose the varying standards of state law upon the consequences of federal military actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.373" offset="8229955">The court denied Feres claim against United States and it did so in very broad language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.367" offset="8257958">It said and quote, “The government is not liable under the Federal Tort Claims Act for injuries to servicemen where those injuries arise out of activity incident to service,” that is exactly of viability that we are talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.172" offset="8321174">Now, the court in Feres appears to realize it was making a difficult judgment with respect to Congress’ intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.351" offset="8345938">But the court said if we are wrong on this, then Congress has a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.460" offset="8362343">It can change the statute, but in the 25 years, since Feres was decided, Congress made no changes in the statute and we think that suggests strongly that the decision to preclude litigation in this area was in fact correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.280" offset="8429635">Now, the nature of petitioner’s claim is an indemnity claim for recovery of injuries to serviceman, and therefore, the subject matter of its claim must be the injury to captain Dunham.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.402" offset="8478118">Captain…</text>

            <text syncTime="2116.106" offset="8564949">The measure of damages is going to turn out to be the amount they had to pay Donham, but it's a different claim, it's a different theory of recovery.</text>

            <text syncTime="2141.141" offset="8665050">That argument would automatically follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.736" offset="8671424">It's a little bit more difficult than that, but we suggest that sense that Feres must have relied upon the natural of the litigation process that was brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.674" offset="8715205">In another words, the Court seem to be concerned, at least it has interpreted in the Brown Case and Munise(ph), the Court seems to be concerned with the affects of a Tort suit challenging the actions of military officers and injuries to military personnel under orders and it's the litigation process which we think is what was the court was concerned about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.216" offset="8801305">Now, that litigation process we suggest must be the same by the nature of indemnity claim, not because of subrogation, but because it will have the same aspects.</text>

            <text syncTime="2741.054" offset="11064658">Now, in Feres and subsequently in the United States vs. Demco, this court found the presence of a compensation scheme to be an important indicator of Congress’ intent to preclude tort remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.346" offset="11113873">Compensation statutes are almost always thought of substitutes for common law tort remedy by the injured party, but another function of a compensation scheme is to limit the liability arising out of a particular activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.087" offset="11172805">The language of this court in Cooper Stevedoring vs. Kopke, it provides a protective mantle for the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.192" offset="11205302">Unlike workman compensation, veteran’s compensation laws provide short compensation for the injured party and a limited liability for the United States and this protective function is especially important here because this is an enormously dangerous business of training and transporting military personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.820" offset="11283773">The compensation scheme we think really represents a Congressional balancing of the necessity to limit cause, but the duty and the responsibility to perform, to provide some reparation, an adequate reparation for these servicemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.122" offset="11345004">Now, that protective function, that balancing of Congress would be just as frustrated by an indirect recovery by way of indemnity as it would be by a direct recovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.938" offset="11384293">We think it is not likely that the congress intended that the liability of United States would be measured by the compensation scheme plus whatever addition amount might be passed through some third party manufacturer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.182" offset="11445210">The fact that the scheme would be equally violated by direct or indirect recovery suggests to us that fact that petitioner is not a serviceman, does not make any difference for the Feres result.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.576" offset="11490768">Now, the petitioner argues that enforcing immunity against a party not governed by compensation scheme is unfair, but this court in other courts have enforced protections to protect mantle of a compensation scheme against third parties to protect what again Cooper Stevedoring called the a result inconsistent with the balance struck by congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2873.718" offset="11595362">The commercial setting here of course we think, especially eliminates any unfairness claim.</text>

            <text syncTime="3023.133" offset="12193044">I would like to mention that as – first of all there is no – it is not clear that this statute would permit, this medical statue is limited as it is would permit recovery against a government contract who was in not exact negligent and let me knows that the Air Force’s policy is not to recover even medical cause against a government contract when the liability of that contractor is based upon products liability or non negligence theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.747" offset="12311431">So, we think that the medical cost recovery is just simply is too diem minims and hypothetical to obstruct the balance of fairness here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.660" offset="12355107">I would like to turn to the third point and the limited nature of the immunity that we do claim here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.011" offset="12388544">Stencel claims that our analysis will preclude every tort action, touching the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.176" offset="12413204">In fact, our claim od immunity is very narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.674" offset="12431176">It only governs situations that are covered by Feres itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.666" offset="12451133">Only where an injury is to a serviceman are there implications for both the compensation scheme and for military discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.023" offset="12484570">Now, because our understanding of Congress’ intent would only bar suits where Feres applies, in many instances criticisms are really addressed to Feres.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.777" offset="12519574">Stencel argues that immunity is not merited here or they might be civilian personnel involved or there is a lots of deterrent value but Captain Donham’s claim is barred in precisely the situation because congress set a broad rule, it did not require an inquiry into each and every injury action to determine whether in fact this action merits in someway a congressional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.802" offset="12623751">It’s notable that all parties to this litigation seem to recognize that suit will have an important impact on Federal Interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.587" offset="12658859">In other words, Stencels’ claim really is in it reply brief that the advantages of deterrents will somehow outweigh the disadvantages of an impact upon compensation scheme and military discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.173" offset="12709223">But that is really a policy decision which we think should be reserved for congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.676" offset="12731166">We think the situation is like United States versus Gilmet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.130" offset="12745063">If you remember in that case The United States sought to bring an indemnity action against one of its government employees and the court said; will that kind of action will have results on the relationship between the government and its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.002" offset="12800547">It will have results with respect of fiscal policy, but it is very difficult for a court to determine exactly what those impacts would be and the court denied the cause of action for indemnity in favor of The United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.627" offset="12851016">Here we think we have the reverse situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.047" offset="12860629">The petitioner seeks to bring a cause of action is going to have to have an impact on fiscal policy on the compensation scheme, on the military discipline, it is difficult to say precisely what all the impacts would be, what all the variations would be, but this is really a policy weighing judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.849" offset="12927920">If Congress wants to change the rule Feres and permit the United States to have liability for injuries to serviceman, Congress can do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.570" offset="12958745">We think that this is not an appropriate rule change for the court to make at least under the teaching of United States versus Gilmet.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.279" offset="12989569">I would like to turn in briefly to the alternative ground for affirming the decision of the Court of Appeals, a ground that does not rest upon the military context at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.172" offset="13033142">A number of Courts of Appeals have held that neither indemnity nor contribution will be permitted in the absence of liability running from The United States to the injured party.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.647" offset="13079117">This is a result which is reached by majority of state courts in workman’s compensation scheme, but where the direct claim of the injured party is barred by Federal Law, we think and the courts have said that the implications of that bar for indemnity or contribution should also be decided as a matter of Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.205" offset="13153305">And this Federal rule of indemnity would preclude indemnity here because The United States is not liable to the injured party itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.714" offset="13191339">We believe that this rule is a proper one, is consistent with the purpose of indemnity because indemnity really shifts cause among viable parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.391" offset="13230105">If the United States is not liable, no shifting should occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.681" offset="13243166">It also ensures that the courts will not commit a third party recovery under a indemnity theory to override or undermine a congressional decision to impose the sovereign immunity bar and of course it makes fundamental good sense here where recovery would impact upon important Federal interests.</text>
