            <text syncTime="56.165" offset="328077">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.483" offset="341347">This is an appeal from a judgment or order of a three-judge District Court in the Southern District of New York, which declared unconstitutional, seven Sections of New York’s judiciary law.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.742" offset="390353">They were declared unconstitutional as on the basis that they were unconstitutional on their face.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.695" offset="418147">In other words that basically that every word in them was unconstitutional, and the basis of this declaration was that they were in violation of the Due Process rights of the appellees -- plaintiffs below.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.660" offset="469974">The statute, or Sections of the statute in question form part of Article 19 of this law, which provide a process and framework for punishing contempts of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.343" offset="536743">In this case, those that are denominated or processed for punishing civil contempts.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.683" offset="566105">However, it should be I think pointed out that this process applies to all disobedience or disregard of court orders, and while this case is said to come up in the context of disregard of a subpoena or in supplementary proceedings to disclose assets after a judgment is obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.291" offset="664534">It would also apply the order of declaration of unconstitutionality to people who violate injunctions in the State Court, support orders where husbands or wives are to support their spouses and the like.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="158.395" offset="736946">Well, are you saying that he District Court didn’t merely strike it down in its application as to these particular plaintiff would simply say the State of New York couldn’t enforce it at all?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="a_seth_greenwald" startTime="168.061" stopTime="253.384">
            <label>Mr. A. Seth Greenwald</label>
            <text syncTime="168.061" offset="775607">I say yes that and that was the effect that the State of New York could not enforce or punish contempts of Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.941" offset="819179">And I say that because it declared the seven Sections of the law unconstitutional on their face, and it also declared this to be a class action and the plaintiffs were all people who’d ever been subject to civil contempt in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.187" offset="888142">And I think it’s rather clear from the order that it applied to people who have been and who are currently subject to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.736" offset="918340">So it had a all pervasive effect and as I say, it basically and totally enjoined this process, which is fundamental to the operation of any court, state or federal.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.061" offset="1003604">Now, as to what are called the facts of this case, the District Court resided what it called the typical case of Harry Vail.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.723" offset="1050311">I wish to emphasis that this was based on simply allegations in a complaint, because there was no trial here, indeed, if you look at the record there’s not even an affidavit from Harry Vail as to the facts of his case.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="253.384" offset="1116871">Did the state file an answer?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="a_seth_greenwald" startTime="255.440" stopTime="305.028">
            <label>Mr. A. Seth Greenwald</label>
            <text syncTime="255.440" offset="1125125">The state in this case or the appellant’s State Court judges, were at the time of the hearing before the three-judge court, moving to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.987" offset="1171310">In effect they never got a chance to file an answer, and I would submit that when the plaintiffs are simply moving for a preliminary injunction, obviously according to the federal rules, there’s no requirement that we file an answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.556" offset="1241631">And after the grant of what was called at first by the way, it was a final order, and then the District Court revised it for partial summary judgment, but basically of course, the partial summary judgment was an injunction and in effect the grant of final reliefs, and certainly it was final insofar as to the appellant’s in State Court judges.</text>

            <text syncTime="305.028" offset="1323447">But they did on page 20, it seems they did try to limit it.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.819" offset="1342673">They granted a declaratory judgment which said, “It was only enjoined against being used against the members who declared.”</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="319.964" offset="1383215">Then I interpreted that they were trying to cut back a little?</text>
            <text syncTime="325.047" offset="1403591">Not that they were successful.[Laughter]</text>

            <label>Mr. A. Seth Greenwald</label>
            <text syncTime="327.964" offset="1415189">I think the District Court realized, because we had a hearing after the first order came down, after the decision came down, which was in the form of an order.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.677" offset="1450088">And I pointed out to the District Court that their order was so all pervasive and all encompassing that it would wreak havoc with the process of State Courts adjudicating civil contempt in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.876" offset="1522918">And I can confidently say that that was the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.819" offset="1558653">Judges and lawyers in the state were in such a state of confusion that nothing could be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.044" offset="1595538">Now, in answer to your question, I think the point was that the District Court may have thought it was perhaps cutting back or being more a little judicious in its order, but the practical effect was still that there was no way in the State of New York to issue -- even issue process in order to show cause.</text>

            <text syncTime="402.542" offset="1713507">I guess, you mean on their faces.</text>

            <label>Mr. A. Seth Greenwald</label>
            <text syncTime="405.934" offset="1727091">And when you excise seven Sections of judiciary law, which provide for the issuance of process, which provide for the hearing, which provide for the punishment, you are left with nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.729" offset="1794278">And as it was pointed out I think, by the Sheriff of the city of New York, unless there’s a statute you cannot ultimately punish someone for contempt by commitment in the State of New York, unless there is some statute in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.128" offset="1859897">Now, getting back to the case of Harry Vail, I also wish to emphasize, and this involves all the appellees that this involves one county of the State of New York, what seems to be the practice or procedure in Dutchess County.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.211" offset="1936175">I think my briefs and the cases I cite show that it is not uniformly or the rule throughout the State of New York as to how Courts proceed in the adjudications of civil contempt’s, and --</text>
