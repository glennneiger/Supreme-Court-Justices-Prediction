            <text syncTime="57.461" offset="330318">Mr. Rodgers, I think you may proceed.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rodgers_jr" startTime="61.569" stopTime="440.024">
            <label>Mr. William H. Rodgers, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="61.569" offset="346723">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.739" offset="355500">My name is William Rodgers, I represent the petitioner, Puyallup Tribe, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.859" offset="375980">This litigation returns here for the third time in its fourteen-year history.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.735" offset="399386">The case involves a fishery for steelhead trout in the Puyallup River, Puyallup Reservation, State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.106" offset="428956">It has been in the courts now for a period covering some four generations of steelhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.727" offset="451422">We believe that is long enough, and we submit there is but one issue left: whether the State has the power to regulate an on-reservation fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.360" offset="489978">Now, this case does not involve salmon; this case does not involve the Department of Fisheries; this case most assuredly does not involve whether traffic lights will be honored in the streets of Tacoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.308" offset="537730">I will attempt to put the issue in context, first by outlining briefly the history of this litigation and then identifying the three propositions that we believe are decisive.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.161" offset="597185">The action was commenced in the Pierce County’s Superior Court back in 1963 against the tribe and 39 named individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.965" offset="640339">The litigation initially resulted in injunction restraining individual tribal members from net fishing for steelhead in the Puyallup River.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.203" offset="681299">The first time the case was here, this Court, viewing the case as an off-reservation case and therefore within Article III of the Treaty -- I will be talking about the Treaty for the next several minutes; it is reprinted in Appendix in 1(a) of our brief -- the first time the case was here, this was viewed as an off-reservation case, and the Court held that State strictures on Indian net fishing could be justified only upon conservation grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.203" offset="793312">On remand for the first time, we learned that the Game Department read "conservation" as permitting a total prohibition against an Indian net fishery if you called it a conservation ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.923" offset="840228">Now, that position eventually resolves in the case coming back here.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.853" offset="855902">This Court held in Puyallup II that allocating all of the harvestable steelhead in the watershed to the sportsmen could not be reconciled with the Treaty language of Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.144" offset="909087">Again, the case was viewed solely as an off-reservation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.496" offset="930507">Now, before this case went to trial for the third time in June of 1974, two Federal decisions were handed down in cases initiated by the United States involving fishing rights of the Puyallup Tribe and other tribes in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.642" offset="995082">Both of these cases were filed early in the 1970s; the first in 1970, the second in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.396" offset="1026116">Now, the first of these cases, United States v. Washington, involves virtually all aspects of treaty fishing rights of the tribes in the Western Washington region: conservation, allocation, tribal self-regulation and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.717" offset="1083376">That decision, affirmed by the Ninth Circuit, certiorari denied here, is now being implemented with the assistance of millions of dollars of Congressional appropriations.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.392" offset="1122037">Now, Phase II of that litigation, scheduled for trial next year, involves claims by the tribes backed again by the United States of treaty entitlement to hatchery fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.588" offset="1170834">This is basically now the litigation involves all tribes, all species, all of the watersheds in the case area and also claims with regard to environmental damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.147" offset="1221094">Now, the second Federal case preceding trial here is also denominated United States v. Washington and is the so-called Puyallup Reservation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.227" offset="1265397">Now, that case was initiated by United States in 1971 directly in response to Footnote 1 of this Court’s decision in Puyallup I, where the Court left open the question of whether the reservation had been terminated or extinguished.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.639" offset="1331017">That case was litigated on a complaint seeking a declaration that the tribe had exclusive right to regulate the fishery within the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.231" offset="1373440">It was litigated on a 60-page pretrial order contending a stipulation of facts detailing the entire history of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.296" offset="1405727">Now, that litigation resulted in a holding by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, again with certiorari denied here, that the reservation continues to exist and that the tribe has a right to fish free from State interference on the river within that reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.235" offset="1477407">Now, with this background, we went to trial for a third time.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.828" offset="1495797">And we submit that three propositions emerge as decisive of the single question presented in the petition here: Proposition 1, the Puyallup reservation continues to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.055" offset="1552744">This proposition, litigated in the Ninth Circuit only a month before trial in this case, was conceded by counsel for the State throughout the trial, found as fact by the Trial Court, accepted as fact by the State Supreme Court; Proposition 2, we are dealing with an on-reservation fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.553" offset="1638739">The facts, again as found by the Trial Court, recognized and accepted by the State Supreme Court, is that substantially all of the Tribe's future steelhead fishery will occur within the boundaries of the reservation, both of those propositions established by the findings below; we then reach Proposition 3, which is decisive here.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.351" offset="1737900">That proposition is found in Article II of the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.159" offset="1761097">Article II reserves for the exclusive use of the Tribe the reservation properties there depicted, including, of course, the river, which is directly within the boundaries of the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.763" offset="1811565">We submit that Article II must be read as reserving to the tribe exclusive power and control to regulate its own members on reservation fisheries.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="440.024" offset="1860571">I had thought your question presented for writ of certiorari was that the State Court simply lack jurisdiction to hail the tribal court before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.321" offset="1901740">I get the impression from hearing your last proposition that you are talking more about the merits, am I wrong?</text>

            <text syncTime="455.530" offset="1922638">No, Your Honor, both propositions are presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.324" offset="1937789">We present them both in a jurisdictional sense and in a sense with regard to the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.772" offset="1959627">We do believe that the argument that I am submitting here, namely, a pre-emption argument, is basically a jurisdictional argument; that is, we feel that Article II of the treaty pre-empts from State authorities any and all power to adjudicate and to regulate that on-reservation fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.567" offset="2054713">So we read that as being jurisdictional in that sense.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="492.097" offset="2068924">And would that extend to individual Indians, as well as the tribe, if it depends on Article II of the treaty, that pre-emption?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rodgers_jr" startTime="502.021" stopTime="532.815">
            <label>Mr. William H. Rodgers, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="502.021" offset="2108525">Your Honor, that would be the case except there are qualifications with regard to individual Indians; namely, other provisions of Federal law, perhaps the Indian Civil Rights Act, but basically we think that that pre-emptive argument would apply to the individuals, as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.549" offset="2198700">We have here, of course, the second issues of sovereign immunity, which depends in part upon that characterization.</text>

            <text syncTime="2836.106" offset="11444898">I represent the largest sport-fishing group in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.305" offset="11461721">There are 150,000 sports fishermen in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.885" offset="11476036">Their interest in this case is primarily on the areas I am going to discuss, which are conservation of the fishing resource and the exclusion of the hatchery fish from the treaty fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.858" offset="11519921">Now, I think the Court are a along way from the rivers of the State of Washington and from the anadromous fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.033" offset="11548656">I think the Court understands from the previous cases that basically steelhead are anadromous fish; that many of them are propagated in hatcheries, artificially propagated in hatcheries, something that was unknown at the time of the treaty of 1855; that on this river -- and this is something that has been developed in this record, which was sent us back to determine -- on this river, on the Puyallup River, almost the entire cost of the hatchery operation is paid for out of dedicated funds of the Department of Game, earmarked or dedicated funds; and the finding is virtually entirely all of those funds for the steelhead operation came from the sports fishermen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.447" offset="11754292">The sports fishermen not only paid for these hatchery fish with their license fees and tags, the records also shows that we have gone out and done voluntary work, we have planted fish, we have enhanced the run, we have worked on the habitat, we have done many things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.581" offset="11806850">It is our basic intention, the reason why my clients have sent me on the plane to come back to Washington, D.C., is to essentially respectfully say to this Court that we really have an equitable interest in these hatchery fish along the lines of the concurring opinion by this Court in this case in Puyallup II, which has now been amply demonstrated by the record that has been made through a ten-day trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.108" offset="11912907">And this was one of the bases of the Supreme Court of Washington's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.398" offset="11930044">It had several bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.773" offset="11935582">It said, first of all, that the hatchery fish equitably belong to those who paid for them with earmarked funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.653" offset="11971108">Secondly, it interpreted the treaty, and it said that in 1855 that no one could have contemplated a hatchery-fish operation, they could not have been intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.140" offset="12013009">And then it looked at a particular part of that treaty, where the treaty talks about the exclusion from the treaty fishery of shellfish that are staked or cultivated by citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.413" offset="12066194">And the Supreme Court of Washington said, "This is a very good indication that if anybody had known about hatchery fish, they would have excluded them, because they excluded another form of marine life in which there was the effort and industry of citizens put into developing the resource".</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.712" offset="12143307">So the first point that I really want to make to this Court is that the concurring opinion of this Court in Puyallup II, which remembers the Court put in your opinion and in the other the majority did not disagree with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.924" offset="12212166">The majority said, "This may be the issue that will be a basis for the remand".</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.238" offset="12233482">So we went back and we tried that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.274" offset="12241632">We proved to the satisfaction of the Trial Court, to the satisfaction of the Supreme Court of Washington, that hatchery fish are identifiable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.117" offset="12272979">We proved also -- and this is something that my colleague tells me was not made as clear as it could be in the brief, and that is the only fish that we claim are hatchery fish are the first generation, those that are propagated in the hatchery, because they can be identified by dorsal-fin damage; that all the progeny of the hatchery fish are counted as natural run, and we are happy to have them counted as natural run.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.536" offset="12406622">So no matter what you do, there is a subsidy that the sports fishermen are doing to help the treaty Indian fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.955" offset="12440267">But in terms of the first-generation hatchery fish, which are put in that river due to our money and our industry and our effort, that our first point respectfully is that the Supreme Court of Washington should be affirmed when it says that those fish are excluded from the treaty fishery; and if they are excluded from the treaty fishery, whether or not there is a reservation, we should not be prevented from having them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.871" offset="12572029">And I gave the example earlier, and I will say it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.508" offset="12582478">It is as if they were domestic cattle wandering onto a reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.339" offset="12609854">They are entitled to get through the reservation to the sports fishermen who paid for them.</text>

            <text syncTime="4364.019" offset="17556610">You found in Puyallup II that an apportionment was required, because a non-Indian sports fishery entirely pre-empted the run.</text>

            <text syncTime="4381.195" offset="17625260">They have a slightly better right than non-Indians, because they need not buy a license for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="5246.884" offset="21088052">I am reading further with regard to the natural hatchery issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="5268.125" offset="21173002">Now, that concept, since we only have jurisdiction off-reservation, is only material to the on-reservation fishery.</text>

            <text syncTime="5288.771" offset="21255549">The entire question of treaty entitlement to hatchery fish is presently pending before Judge Bolt.</text>
            <text syncTime="5296.440" offset="21286269">My proof on this question, and if I did bring it here was curtailed repeatedly by exclusions of evidence in a nonjury trial dealing with competition between natural and hatchery fish, environmental damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5313.244" offset="21353456">For example, the position of the State on this question is that if simply the run were destroyed, the natural run were entirely destroyed and replaced by a hatchery run, then basically there is no more treaty entitlement to that fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.399" offset="21414060">Secondly, on the sovereign-immunity question, the Attorney General has understated the issue substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="5335.017" offset="21440601">Basically on the sovereign-immunity issue, if this Court affirms, you are opening up litigation against a tribe to allocate and apportion its natural resources in State Courts throughout the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="5351.774" offset="21507578">The Congress has never permitted such a lawsuit, and I submit that if there is an affirmance on that sovereign-immunity proposition, the effects would be devastating.</text>

            <text syncTime="5411.442" offset="21746233">The court below allocated on a 45/55 basis; for our purposes, that is insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5418.593" offset="21774863">There is a further question whether the hatchery fish are excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="5422.463" offset="21790328">Presently, under Federal Court order pending adjudication of this entire question in Phase II of United States against Washington, the State is enjoined from excluding hatchery fish from its regulatory activity with regard to all runs, including the Puyallup River.</text>
            <text syncTime="5443.499" offset="21874442">Now, that meant, again in response to another question, that there indeed is a possibility of Federal/State injunctions, and this Court has looked with a lack of encouragement to that activity, and we have had alternatives and occasionally have gone before the Federal Court to seek injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="5466.166" offset="21965139">But on this question, on the question of State power to control on-reservation, we have come up through direct appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="5575.336" offset="22401802">Except the reservation now exists, and the orders that initially run against individuals now run against the Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="5588.613" offset="22454987">The Tribal Council, the tribal governing body, its legislative body, has been ordered to enact closures, to enforce closures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5599.602" offset="22498873">The case has been transformed into an off-reservation individual case into an on-reservation suit against the Tribe itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="5609.123" offset="22537012">And I would submit in conclusion that the history of this litigation has been determined by one overriding factor, and that is to restrict the Indian fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.589" offset="22582883">We have had in this case argued at various times that the tribe is defunct, that the treaty is a worthless scrap of paper, that the reservation does not exist, but that if it does there is power to control as if it did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.558">We urge the Court to reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="5634.983">We urge the Court to go further and to dismiss on the ground, we fear, that the slightest ambiguity in its disposition will result in additional litigation.</text>
