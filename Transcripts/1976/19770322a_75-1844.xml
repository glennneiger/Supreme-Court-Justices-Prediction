            <label>Mr. Louis Gilden</label>
            <text syncTime="8.654" offset="135152">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.891" offset="148109">Continuing my argument in this matter, I might say that the government at no time before in the District Court or in the Eighth Circuit ever contended that the defendant had to prove the governmental misconduct, the tactical advantage secured by the government by delaying prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.610" offset="222924">This is the first time that it has been raised and that is in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.914" offset="236194">The government conceded before the District Court that all you had to do is prove the prejudicial delay and the subsequent result in material prejudice and both elements were proved in the District Court and affirmed by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.059" offset="296798">It is a little bit unusual to come at this late date and say the Eighth Circuit was an error, when the same Eighth Circuit did not have these fundamentals before them at the time that the government argued its case and presented its brief to the Eighth Circuit when they said all Marion required was the delay was unreasonable and is subsequent result in material prejudice.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="70.919" offset="384151">That you see is the defendant’s burden.</text>

            <label>Mr. Louis Gilden</label>
            <text syncTime="74.147" offset="397108">That was our burden and we proved that burden by showing the 17-month delay, by proving that the defendant had called the government from time to time on five or six occasions said, what is going on?</text>
            <text syncTime="90.029" offset="460638">The government conceded that he had anxiety about 1situation and then the result in prejudice in the death of, well might say that there were two witness that died.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.110" offset="504942">However, the District Court laid its fundamentals of material prejudice on the death of Stewart and the Eight Circuit affirmed that finding that there was material prejudice in the death of Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.596" offset="546946">So, there was the result in material prejudice.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="114.311" offset="557709">That Mr. Stewart had to do only was sum of the guns not all of them.</text>

          <turn speaker="louis_gilden" startTime="118.464" stopTime="166.511">
            <label>Mr. Louis Gilden</label>
            <text syncTime="118.464" offset="574323">That is correct, but that was never isolated as to where -- the government never isolated or of course the government did not know which ones came from Stewart and which ones came from finding the guns in the car at the terminal of railroad mail facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.888" offset="640047">However, the Court concluded that the very essential element which is the question, did Lovasco know that the guns were stolen would be something that would be deprived of him by a trial without having this material evidence present at the any trial by the death of the witness?</text>
            <text syncTime="157.133" offset="729072">And the Court concluded that – what is really essential Mr. Justice Blackmun is the question that, the government did not do anything for 17 months.</text>

            <text syncTime="166.511" offset="766584">Well, this is my next question, does your position depend on what the governments investigation uncovers in the interim.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.340" offset="801902">Suppose they had done something and it either did or did not produce something additional, your position different.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.738" offset="847459">I think that, if the government had just showed that they were trying to do something for 17 months, my position would be totally different before this Court and would have been different, I think, the proceedings refer the District Court because…</text>

            <text syncTime="217.182" offset="969294">I think that was in the framework with the statute limitations and the question of foreseeability, I do not think that the defendant can hold the government to that kind of strict proof and hold that sort of confined within a box that way.</text>

            <text syncTime="325.163" offset="1401150">That is correct, that is all I am asking for before this Court, I do not think that I am asking for any principles which nail the government into a justification which might meet the merits of the case or getting into substance of the issues of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.570" offset="1466770">Just showing some consideration with respect to the fact that there has been a completed investigation and now we want to get some more evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.956" offset="1496341">I might say that this Court should see the protectuality of what the government has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.084" offset="1520896">In the District Court, that the government argued and there was never any proof in the record about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.712" offset="1543361">The government argued that they were trying to get evidence that the son was implicated, the defendant’s son and they want to nail him; they did not feel the defendant was guilty, but they felt the son was the guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.550" offset="1590695">Then in Eighth Circuit, they changed that argument and they said that “We want to find out, who stole the mail”.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.633" offset="1619012">Then the government comes before this Court, in abundance both of those arguments and says to this Court, “We wanted to continue the investigation to nail the defendant, we want to get more evidence on him.”</text>
            <text syncTime="391.979" offset="1668435">So now they have got three arguments and none of those were supported by the record in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1241.376" offset="5066026">Couple of brief comments Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.730" offset="5079400">Mr. Gilden suggest that if the government had done anything here perhaps this case should not be here, well then maybe it should not be here at the hearing on the motion to dismiss the United States Attorney in response to questions indicated that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.759" offset="5131541">Furthermore as to additional witnesses received that to the date of September 26, 1973 that is true, that is there were few additional witnesses discovered, but not as to the investigation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.633" offset="5175008">The Eight Circuit expressly credited that representation and none of the less held that the indictment in this case should be dismissed finding that that was not a sufficient justification for the 18 months delay that occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.444" offset="5222342">Mr. Justice Stevens, as I recall yesterday you expressed some concern about having government counsel testify routinely in response to motion such as respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.928" offset="5256197">I should point out that that is a much greater problem under the Eighth Circuit's formulation than under what we believe the Due Process Clause means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.871" offset="5287962">Whenever the defendant, under the Eighth Circuit’s formulation has been able to make a facially credible allegation of prejudice, the Eighth Circuit would have the government come in an attempt to formatively to justify any delay that occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.059" offset="5336759">The only way that could be done is by having the United States Attorney or the Assistant United States Attorney come in, attempt the document, the course of the investigation at detail, saying who was doing what at what time for what reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.601" offset="5390884">Government counsel might also have to take the stand under the view of the under the Due Process Clause as we believe it should be construed, but the enquiry would be much more limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1333.118" offset="5432994">Government counsel already takes the stand in a number of contexts for example the one that most readily comes to mind, are motions that deal with some aspect to pre-bargaining negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.346" offset="5477924">With respect to the questions that you asked yesterday Mr. Justice Marshall, the government's position is not that a potential defendant has an obligation to ask to be indicted, he may of course do nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.154" offset="5529124">The question here is under what circumstances a defendant is entitled to come into court and say guilty or not, the Due Process Clause prevents the government from trying me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.558" offset="5574786">Now, we have suggested that the defendant may make the records showing in any of several ways and all my response to your question yesterday was intended to indicate is that, if a defendant, a potential defendant had indicated that if the government delayed in reaching a decision whether to prosecute, he might be prejudiced, he would be in a stronger position to claim immunity from prosecution.</text>
