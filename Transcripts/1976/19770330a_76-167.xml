            <text syncTime="68.966" offset="376382">The issue in this case is whether probable cause in a search warrant are required before customs officials may open an envelope mailed into the United States from abroad, when they have reason to suspect that the envelope may contain contrabands or dutiable goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.371" offset="437927">In our view, such custom searches of international mail at the border of our country are reasonable in the absence of probable cause or a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.091" offset="468856">We submit that this position is supported by the backgrounds of the Fourth Amendment, by nearly 200 years of American history, and by the repeated and consistent pronouncements of this Court and of every other Court to have considered the question, save one.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.349" offset="529878">The one exemption is the Court below, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which held by a vote of two to one, that the Fourth Amendment prohibits customs inspections of what it termed, letter mail, entering this country from overseas, unless the government first obtains a search warrant issued upon probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.589" offset="614828">The facts released on February 4th, 1974, George Kallnischkies, a Customs Inspector at the General Post Office in New York came across eight envelopes that had been mailed from Thailand to four different places in the Washington D.C. area.</text>

            <text syncTime="186.701" offset="847318">Yes, officer Kallnischkies weighed the envelopes because they seemed rather unusually bulky and large, and he determined that they weighed 42 grams, which is about an ounce-and-a-half.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.811" offset="895696">Although an ordinary airmail envelope of that size generally weighs about 7-14 grams.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.567" offset="914713">So they were substantially heavier than a normal size envelope, normal envelope of that size.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.433" offset="938224">Now, other things attracted officer Kallnischkies’ attention and gave him reason to suspect these envelopes.</text>

            <text syncTime="218.498" offset="974482">And second, as I mentioned a moment earlier, they were rather bulky in appearance, and when he felt them they clearly felt as if they contained something other than or an addition to correspondence inside of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="769.805" offset="3179739">The DEA agents observed respondent Kelly collect the envelopes, meet with respondent Ramsey, and give Ramsey a brown paper bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.518" offset="3214534">Respondents were then arrested, and evidence seized insolent to these arrests eventually led to their conviction on a variety of narcotics offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.079" offset="3248807">Divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed these convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.817" offset="3263749">The Court held that officer Kallnischkies’ opening of the envelopes in the absence of a warrant issued upon probable cause violated the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.123" offset="3293006">Although the Court acknowledged that border searches have traditionally been recognized as an exception to the warrant requirement to the Fourth Amendment, and although the Court conceded that the Customs agent here had reason to suspect that the envelopes may have contained merchandise subject to duty or prohibited from entering the country, it nonetheless concluded that the border search exception should apply only to packages mailed into the United States from foreign countries, and should not be extended to so called, letter mail, such as it believed was involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.002" offset="3420483">Now, we believe that the decision below is wrong, and that it threatens a substantial inroad in the government’s ability to detect and to prevent smuggling.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.212" offset="3453293">There is, as the Court of Appeals acknowledged, an established border search power.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.489" offset="3470429">This Court has referred many times to the legitimacy of that power, as an essential means of protecting our nation’s security and revenue, and inherent right of any sovereign to control the introduction of prohibited or dutiable articles into its territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.816" offset="3531765">Such searches in the absence of probable cause or a warrant had repeatedly been held to be reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, because of the paramount need of the government to know what is being brought into this country, and because the minimal intrusion which the search entails invades areas in which persons have at best only a minimal expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.221" offset="3609401">Indeed as we noted in our brief, the very Congress that passed and adopted the Fourth Amendment also enacted a statute allowing customs officers to carry out warrantless border searchers whenever they had reason to suspect that goods, wares, and merchandise subject to duty were being concealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.103" offset="3676901">Now, this border search power, as the Court of Appeals agreed, and as we do not understand respondents to contest, allows customs officials to search people, luggage, automobile, chattels of every description, and mailed packages without probable cause or a search warrant as they seek to enter the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.775" offset="3751611">This being so, we can perceive no reason or justification to carve out an exception for so-called letter mail entering this country.</text>

            <text syncTime="928.416" offset="3814096">Certainly Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.062" offset="3828725">Almost a century ago in Cotzhausen v. Nazro in 107 US, this Court observed that our customs laws and border search powers would be meaningless if, and I am quoting now, “If the mail is to be left on watched and all its sealed contents would be exempt from seizure”.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.544" offset="3894658">And as this case graphically illustrates, small sealed envelopes, equally as well as a suitcase or a package, may conceal merchandise which Congress has decided may not be brought into the United States or may enter only upon payment to the duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.398" offset="3958083">Now, the Court of Appeals concluded that while it was reasonable to make a border search of mailed packages without a warrant or probable cause, it was unreasonable to make a similar search of envelopes, sent as letter class mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.227" offset="4009388">It provided a number of reasons for its attempt to distinguish between envelopes and packages in the mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.782" offset="4035615">We think that none of these reasons can withstand analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.293" offset="4045646">Some of them can be disposed of rather quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.596" offset="4054841">The Court of Appeals thought first, that the border search exception was grounded in the notion of exigent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.895" offset="4080023">It would said the Court be too difficult to obtain a warrant when the subject of the border search is mobile, such as a car or a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.237" offset="4113460">But the court thought this rationale was somehow inapplicable to letter mail, which it said can easily be detained while a warrant is sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.756" offset="4143553">So I have already noted however, border searchers do not depend for their reasonableness upon any notion of exigent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.158" offset="4173123">They have their own practical and historical footing, and this is shown by the fact that while the presence of exigent circumstances has traditionally been held only to excuse the failure to obtain a warrant, the border search is an exception not only to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment, but also to the probable cause requirement of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.028" offset="4252640">I would also add that the Court of Appeals’ opinion is even internally inconsistent on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.661" offset="4271135">Since it will allow the opening of mailed packages on to the border search exception, even though such packages, just like envelopes, could be detained while a warrant is sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.784" offset="4311572">Now, the Court of Appeals also thought that there was no great need to allow routine border searches of letter-sized envelopes because unlike packages or suitcases, there are limited kinds of materials that could be concealed inside such envelopes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.186" offset="4365176">Again, we think the Court’s objection totally misses the mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.390" offset="4378028">While it is of course true that envelopes cannot be used to transport certain types of merchandise, because by law a letter class mail cannot be larger than 24x36 inches and cannot weight more than 4 pounds or 60 pounds, if it is from Canada, these envelopes are an extremely effective means of transporting other types of merchandise, especially drugs and pornography, which need only be brought into the United State a small quantity at a time to be of substantial value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.979" offset="4484398">The statistics we have reproduced at Appendix B of our brief bear this out, because they show that the number of seizures of these prohibited articles from letter class mail dwarfs the amount found in package mail coming from overseas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1213.920" offset="4956170">The Court thought, and I am quoting now from Page 11(a) of the Appendix to our petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.480" offset="4974351">“The mere knowledge on the part of individuals of the practice of routinely opening letter mail inhibits the exercise of free speech”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.157" offset="5009146">“We submit that there is nothing to this concern on the part of the Court Appeals”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.214" offset="5029313">First, and I cannot emphasize this point too strongly, customs officers are prohibited from reading correspondence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.965" offset="5060346">Although the Court of Appeals sprinkled its opinion with references to the practice of routinely opening letters, there is absolutely no routine practice by the customs service of opening envelopes containing written matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.662" offset="5111128">The authority of customs officials to open international mail is strictly limited by law to envelopes that they have reason to believe may contain merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.459" offset="5150312">Beyond that, if an envelope that appears to contain merchandise is opened for a customs inspection, and it is found to contain not only goods but also correspondence, customs officials similarly are prohibited by law from reading the correspondence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.365" offset="5205900">There is a specific customs regulation that covers these situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.309" offset="5221678">19 CFR § 145.3, which is reprinted at Page 2(a) of our brief states that, “No customs officer or employee shall read or authorize or allow any other person to read any correspondence contained in sealed letter mail of foreign origin unless a warrant is obtained.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.489" offset="5454482">Now, in light of the provisions I have just outlined, we contend that there is no justifiable reason to promulgate a broad rule prohibiting warrantless customs inspections of letter class envelopes, for fear of the chilling effect on freedom of expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.608" offset="5510906">The customs statute is not intended to restrict or to inhibit freedom of expression, and people who desire not to have their international mail opened at the border can easily avoid that result simply by not sending their letters in envelopes so bulky that they appear to contain something other than correspondence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.578" offset="5574749">For example, they may use an aerogram, which is frequently used in international mail; it is a thin piece of onionskin type paper, folded into the form of an envelope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.447" offset="5606305">It is clear that those aerograms contain nothing but correspondence in the normal case, and they are not opened because customs officials have no reason to open them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.666" offset="5635145">They could not possibly have reason to suspect they contain prohibited articles or contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.073" offset="5660745">Now, there is nothing in the record in this case to suggest that such mail is opened by customs officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.668" offset="5687180">Now, there may in fact be legitimate privacy interest involved whenever an envelope is opened, even one coming from overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.750" offset="5715497">But we believe that this concerns would at most justify a rule that correspondence seized without a warrant or probable cause, or fruits derived from the reading of such correspondence may not be admitted into evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.941" offset="5764189">A rule such as this would fully satisfy the possible invasions of privacy that troubled the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.799" offset="5787700">But we fail to understand how those interests are protected or furthered by excluding from evidence, merchandise such as the heroin taken from the envelopes in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1459.438" offset="5938269">In fact, it is especially difficult to fathom why an exclusionary rule designed to protect the free flow of information should be imposed here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1477.128" offset="6009009">And whatever inhibitory effect border searches of international mail may have on others, respondents were not exposed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.117" offset="6036908">By the way, I should at this point clear up a misconception that arises several times throughout respondent’s briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.800" offset="6063657">We stated in our brief that available statistics indicate that customs officers discovered contraband or dutiable goods in 20% of the international letter class mail that they open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.320" offset="6109737">Now, respondents conclude from this statistic that nothing but correspondence is found in the other 80%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.867" offset="6131993">This is totally incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.882" offset="6140039">Most of the 80% of the letter class envelopes that are opened and do not contain article subject to seizure are found to contain merchandise that for one reason or another is not subject to a duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.762" offset="6179536">For example, a gift under $10.00 makes up a large percentage of these letter class envelopes that are opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.029" offset="6204614">Very few of the letter class envelopes that are opened, there is nothing but correspondence found, and this is of course what we would expect since customs officials are empowered to open envelopes only if they have reason to believe that the envelope may contain merchandise subject to duty or imported contrary to law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1603.114" offset="6512963">Now, in response to the question by Mr. Justice Blackmun a moment ago, it is true that in 1971, the Customs Service after consultation with the Postal Service changed its procedures for inspecting international letter class mail, but these changes represent we believe only a modification of prior practices rather than a drastic break with the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.368" offset="6585897">The important fact to be noted is that, at no time in our nation’s history, not before 1971 and not after 1971, has a sender or addressee of international letter class mail sent into this country ever had any expectation that, that envelope would be delivered to its destination without being opened in the presence of the customs service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.155" offset="6665100">Now, from 1924 when the Universal Postal Convention first allowed dutiable articles to be inserted into letter class mail, until 1971, the practice of the Customs Service and the Postal Service when they receive the letter class envelope apparently containing merchandise as follows, they would send it on, notify the addressee to come to the post office, and they would not turn over that envelope unless the addressee consented to having it opened by the customs agent standing there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.001" offset="6780457">Now, what this effectively did was to give a free rein to smugglers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.990" offset="6800415">Since if their envelopes came through unopened, then they had succeeded, if on the other hand, their envelope was stopped and they were notified to come to the postal service and pick it up, they would simply refuse delivery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.901" offset="6840121">Under the Universal Postal Convention at that point, the letter had to be sent back to the country of origin, unopened presumably, where the sender could try to send it again and hopefully it would get through a second time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1938.392" offset="7854090">When a man and his trunk can disappear into the country, the statutes indicated, and the Court held reason of exceptions to the warrant requirement, that there was no warrant required because of the exigency of the situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2012.924" offset="8152199">The Court in Carroll itself, as we read it, drew the distinction when these items, dutiable, that had come across the border were in a possession to be searched via a search warrant, the statutes themselves, these foundation statutes, require the customs people to in fact get a search warrant regardless of the fact that these were dutiable goods, had come across the border, and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.863" offset="8247912">I think for that reason the Court in Carroll, which was possibly one of the only cases that got into this matter in some detail, clearly makes the distinction between a movable situation, ambulatory situation, and a permanent situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2717.687" offset="10971229">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.345" offset="10989829">I think it is important to realize first, that this is the first time in this Court’s history that not only this question, but apparently any question of the search and seizure power at the border, with regard to goods or letters has ever come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.033" offset="11068614">Much has been said about Carroll v. The United States, that was a 1924 case; that case, that quotation, is pure dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.401" offset="11106126">You may recall that in that case, it was a prohibition case, a moving automobile, apparently carrying liquor, moving between Detroit and Grand Rapids, the only question in the case, it had nothing to do with the border, it had nothing to do with customs, it had nothing to do with letters, the only question in that case was whether there was probable cause for the search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.383" offset="11194002">But in the context of the opinion it is true that the quotation read by Mr. Justice Rehnquist was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.772" offset="11219602">I will also concede that, that quotation has been much adverted to by this Court, I do not want to deny that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2786.599" offset="11246873">But this Court has never held that there is a border search exception, as it has been describe here today, not once in its history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.942" offset="11284281">I find no basis in this Court’s opinion for saying that the Fourth Amendment does not operate at the border.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.002" offset="11312493">I think some of the language that we have heard here this afternoon suggests that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.805" offset="11331719">I do not believe that the Fourth Amendment does not operate at a certain place in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.101" offset="11352931">I do think that the way this Court has approached other search and seizure cases, and particularly the border patrol cases, tells us that when we look at a case like this we use a discriminating standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.802" offset="11407683">If there is a so-called border search exception, it cannot be a blunderbuss exception for everything that crosses the border, whether there is a need for it or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.274" offset="11453554">I do not believe that this Court would sustain a position like that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3586.967" offset="14448336">From 1924, 1924 was the first time under the Universal Postal Convention that dutiable articles were allowed to be inserted into letter class mail, before that you could not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.313" offset="14489714">1924 until 1971, when a piece of letter class mail come into the United States and appeared bulky enough to contain something other than correspondence, there was reason to suspect it contained merchandise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.143" offset="14537048">It did not have a green label on it, if it had a green label that would have been a consent to search from the sender.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.183" offset="14557215">If under all those circumstances a letter came in, the addressee was notified that a piece of mail addressed to him had been received, and that there was reason to suspect it contained merchandise, subject to duty or contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.551" offset="14610713">He came to the post office and the envelope would not be surrendered to him unless he consented to have the custom service open it, and that was the practice before 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.688" offset="14651256">There has never been a practice of delivering these bulky letter class envelopes without opening them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.272" offset="14673616">The only difference now is that we open them at the border rather than giving smugglers the opportunity to refuse delivery and escape detection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.277" offset="14713636">Now, in response to Mr. Justice Stevens’ questions about the statutory authority, I do not know if there really is a serious question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.350" offset="14745923">It is hard to understand why Congress would intend to exempt envelopes or packages, no one disputes the packages can be opened, from customs inspections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3670.592" offset="14782808">Certainly the postal services and the custom service have considered for the last 100 years that they have this authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.132" offset="14804960">This Court considered in Cotzhausen in 1882 that they had that authority, and in none of the Court of Appeals cases has anyone ever questioned the statutory authority to open envelopes, letter class envelopes or packages.</text>
