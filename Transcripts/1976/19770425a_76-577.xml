            <text syncTime="87.666" offset="350563">I am John Lancione, arguing for the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.887" offset="379507">In this case, we are here by virtue of the question involving the applicability of freedom of the press in the First Amendment as it is and has been applied to the right of publicity as expressed by the Ohio State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.802" offset="455158">In our case, a public performer, a man who has an act known as the human cannonball was performing at a local fair and I believe the critical facts in this case revolved around the -- the way the news media ended up putting his performance on its new show.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.476" offset="541884">And that is a news paper reporter, a freelance reporter went to the fair and made an inquiry of Mr. Zacchini concerning the filming of his act, and was told specifically that this privilege was rejected and that he did not wish his act to be filmed by the reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.078" offset="612310">The reporter returned and spoke to the news manager and was told by way of affidavit to go out and film the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.198" offset="648777">And indeed, he did, and the act takes 15 seconds for Mr. Zacchini to complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.293" offset="677094">That is his only professional show.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.262" offset="689006">That is the entirety of his performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.479" offset="701858">He's shot out of a cannon and traveled several 100 feet in the air, lands in a net.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.738" offset="726936">In 15 seconds, that's the end of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.284" offset="737071">It is dramatic.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.245" offset="740937">It is unusual and that's why I take it that he's been able to sell this act around the country and -- and make a living.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.553" offset="778136">The Supreme Court of Ohio, in response to our motions, stated that there is indeed a right of publicity that inheres in a professional entertainment's -- entertainer's act that he has a property right to govern how, when and where his performance is published.</text>

            <text syncTime="3089.311" offset="12357172">But if it's going to be the test of news is whether or not it's via a medium that is making a profit, then Your Honor, I submit that we are not far away from total government control as in some countries of news, that if you don't any news except that which the ruling will approve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.675" offset="12450691">The other point that I want to try and be sure to clarify was this matter of the right of privacy into the right of publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.598" offset="12498338">The original -- the first recognition of the right of privacy in this country was in New York State by statute, after it's been held of little girl who had her picture used on a flower sect, if I remember rightly, had no right of recovery, and they passed the commercial appropriation theory of the right of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.187" offset="12588722">Now, Prosser has expanded into other areas that are somewhat related.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.523" offset="12610038">The right of publicity was first recognized as a name, as I recall it by Judge Jerome Frank in the Topps Trading Card case, the baseball players' pictures and statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.067" offset="12668238">And he called to said, it might be more appropriately known as the right of publicity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.580" offset="12690286">So, even in New York State with the right of privacy has still control of the same statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.105" offset="12708362">They have a commonly right now of publicity, but the common law right of publicity that has been recognized has been recognized as a right which can be exercised only when there is the commercial use in most places.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.985" offset="12771892">Our Court actually has given a performer, a greater right under the right of publicity because the defense of -- of the immediate privilege is circumscribed a little more than it would be where the complainant would have to prove that there was a commercial appropriation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.470" offset="12873874">And the final point that I would like to make, if the Court pleases, that this is a situation which, in my judgment, very clearly, if this narrow interest plea of this plaintiff is recognized is having any First Amendment or constitutional breadth or right, would be an act of beating the shield of the First Amendment for free speech and free press into a sword.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.057" offset="13020160">And that sword would chop down the historic right of the states to determine their common law, subject to not violating some federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.113" offset="13076376">And in this case, an area has always been not violating the minimum standards determined by this Court applicable to the First Amendment privilege.</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.214" offset="14052833">They say specifically in the second paragraph that under the standards articulated by the Court, and they're referring to the Supreme Court and they say Time v. Hill and they go on to describe the privilege, and then they go over once again in -- in discussing these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.894" offset="14131513">They say that the same privilege exists in cases where appropriation of a right of publicity is claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.491" offset="14157949">They're talking about the First Amendment privilege that has been discussed, and that was discussed by them in New York Times versus Sullivan and Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.364" offset="14193371">And I don't think there's any question that they feel constrained just as the district, the -- the Seventh Circuit, I believe, in Gertz felt constrained by Rosenbloom to say that the stiff standards of New York Times versus Sullivan had to apply to a private individual because they said it dealt with a -- a issue of public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.156" offset="14284591">And the court there, because my most worthy opponent has raised the question of -- of how we get here and why we are here, thus the Court stated in Gertz, the petitioner appealed to contest the applicability of the New York Times standard to this case and that's why they were here in Gertz and that's why we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.245" offset="14376960">In his brief, he also points out that a new trial cannot be ordered, but I think on page 352 of Gertz, the Supreme Court suggested that a new trial should take place and remanded to the lower court for proceedings not inconsistent with the decision.</text>
