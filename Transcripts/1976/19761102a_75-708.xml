          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="12.667" stopTime="243.817">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="12.667" offset="151132">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.217" offset="161372">As this become apparent by now the government has confessed here on two of the three issues in this case, and we think that’s it is clear, we require to do so and I will explain why, briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.193" offset="213303">The prosecution here took place of course after the decision of this Court in Miller against California, but it was for conduct that it occurred prior to the Miller decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.437" offset="250293">That was in a time when the governing law in this area was that announced in Roth against United States as substantially modified by Memoirs against Massachusetts.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.286" offset="289686">In a word petitioners acted at the time when the law required that their materials, their film would be shown to the utterly without redeeming social value.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.965" offset="332317">But the jury was charged under the Miller standard which requires that the work taken as a whole lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.567" offset="374740">But there is a difference between the two standards as evident that was recognized in the Miller decision itself in the Miller opinion itself which said that Memoirs represented the sharp break with Roth and that was recognized again in Hamling against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.835" offset="435867">It is also clear that Miller represented a swing back towards the real understanding of the Roth decision, although it refined the Roth standards greatly, and it seems clear therefore the petitioners who tried under a standard that gave the prosecution less of a burden, considerable less of a burden and the law provided at the time they acted.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.573" offset="514757">It has been suggested to the test annunciated by the three justices in Memoirs, it never became the law because it never commanded the adherence of the majority of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.225" offset="557388">Therefore, it is said Roth remained the law and since Miller is like Roth petitioners just got the jury instruction they were entitled towards something close to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.335" offset="593855">That argument I must say, unhappily seems to be not the whole twater.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.039" offset="608693">If the Memoirs plurality was not the law than one of two things would follow and I think either it is inadmissible, either there was no law at all between the Memoirs and Miller in which case there would be no places for any prosecution of conduct occurring during those eight years or Roth remained the law despite the fact that any conviction obtained under Roth would be reversed because three justices hearing to Memoirs and two justices thought that no obscenity conviction could standup.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.281" offset="745679">Moreover, in Redrup against New York and the cases thereafter up to Miller this Court reviewed allegedly obscene materials on the basis of the different views of the justices and reversed it over 30 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.765" offset="803566">So it is plained that there was law during that period and I think it is plained therefore that it consistent effectively of the plurality opinion in Memoirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.525" offset="842646">Moreover, I think that the opinion in Hamling against United States would sustain their conviction where pre-Miller conduct also shows that Roth Memoirs was the law during the period.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.148" offset="893114">Now even though that is court made law, it is effectively read into the statute and I do not think there is anyway that a charge of the change that occurred in Miller can retroactively be applied to these petitioners that would deny them due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.646" offset="959047">Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals tried to distinguish Bouie against City of Columbia and I do not think the principle of these two cases can be distinguished because here Miller relaxed the constitutional rules which had previously been applied and that has the effect which is indistinguishable from reading a statute to cover conduct which it previously did not cover, and for that reason, the government face a petitioner entitled to a new trial with a properly instructed jury.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="243.817" offset="1075762">Well, Mr. Solicitor General as I understand the State of the law on this particular question when it comes here from the Sixth Circuit the government had this case and another Court of Appeals decision with it, several other Courts of Appeals decisions against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.279" offset="1145666">Don’t you think the Solicitor General has some responsibility under the adversary system when there is a plausible argument to be made in support of affirming a judgment that has gone in favor of the government to make that argument rather than simply adopt what he thinks is the law?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="277.400" offset="1210136">I do indeed Mr. Justice Rehnquist and we have considered this case, this principle for at least three years now and if I thought there were a plausible case to be made for applying Miller standards to pre-Miller conduct I would certainly make that argument.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="297.805" offset="1291743">What are you saying then when you say you do not think a plausible case can be made is that two Courts of Appeals presumably consisting of Judges appointed by the President and conformed by the Senate have reached to a totally implausible result that the government is unwilling to even argue in favor of in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.844" offset="1371886">Well, that in the fact is correct Mr. Justice Rehnquist those Courts of Appeals quite unfortunately from my point of view because I would like to be able to argue to uphold these convictions and I deplore the waste of resources that has gone in this prosecution must now be re-prosecuted but nothing in those Courts of Appeals Mr. Justice Rehnquist opinions gave me any -- I thought any intellectually defensible way to defend the convictions here.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="345.806" offset="1483690">Well, but how is this Court suppose to function in that kind of a situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.193" offset="1501245">We are supposedly the beneficiaries of an adversary process and I am sure we would look with great skepticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.254" offset="1529561">Mr. Smith had come here when the position that you now are and said he represented his clients and he realized he had a couple of Courts of Appeals cases going for him but he just cuold not in good conscience say that their judgment should be reversed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_h_bork" startTime="374.419" stopTime="395.051">
            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="374.419" offset="1598211">Well, I think the answer can only be that the government feels it has an obligation not only to the adversary process but also to the law and to justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.275" offset="1645650">In the case where it thinks an injustice has been done and that there is no intellectually defensible way of supporting the conviction I think the government must say so.</text>

            <text syncTime="395.051" offset="1680758">But isn’t that ultimately the reasonability of this Court to decide whether or not an injustice has been done or whether or not a particular conviction should be upheld or reversed?</text>

            <text syncTime="734.173" offset="3037245">Petitioners -- and I am relieved I may say, they come to a point where I disagree with the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.695" offset="3059292">I have argued that the Federal Court’s instruction to the jury to assess the films in accordance to contemporary standards of the community standards generally help throughout the Eastern District of Kentucky was erroneous because the jury should have been instructed to apply standards of the Cincinnati Metropolitan Area from which where some of them live and some of them worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.025" offset="3156572">I should say that their argument does not support that conclusion because the Cincinnati Metropolitan Area certainly is no more relevant in any sense than is the Eastern District of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.188" offset="3201294">The jurors here did not live throughout the Cincinnati Metropolitan Area anymore than they live throughout the Eastern District of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.811" offset="3243717">Moreover, they withdrawn from a pool which had a widespread geographic distribution of available jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.506" offset="3290528">If the panel did not have widespread distribution, petitioners would have liked, certainly no objection was made to that at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.696" offset="3335250">But I think in any event, I don’t think our objection would have been availing nor do I think it should have been.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.604" offset="5766936">I think that it does but it is your word, it is the Chief Justice hear words suggesting that you are making a contrast between states and between cities; it is not all as broad as all states.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Eugene Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="1442.067" offset="5868814">But the Court did go on to say that because of the variation the people should not be strangled by the imposition of an absolute standard in terms of -- I read it to mean an absolute geographical standard, and I say that that is what I find intolerable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.090" offset="5936837">Of course, Mr. Justice Rehnquist in his argument or his opinion of this Court in the Hamling case did allow the Court suggest the trial judge would have some discretion in allowing evidence of community standards in communities other than that from where the jury is sitting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.819" offset="6011756">Mr. Justice Stevens asked about the concept of the community standard in terms of a market research program where you find out that everybody came from another community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.730" offset="6043416">Well, there are cases that are working that way up in the federal system where the films, let us say, is delivered from California to Memphis, Tennessee and it has never been shown to Memphis, Tennessee, it was not designed to be shown in Memphis, Tennessee, absolutely no evidence that it had anything more than it touch that area from the standpoint distribution, now what community do we put there and the concept that we put the community from which it came, the community where it was intended to be shown and if you are going to put geographical limits, you are going to have these problems that present themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.567" offset="6154802">So, I think it is not just philosophical in answering Mr. Justice Stevens’ question, there are cases where there is no showing that the film has ever been depict, didn’t exhibit in that community, none whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.860" offset="6199942">That is the community standard that has been employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.376" offset="6214048">And so with that I averse.</text>
