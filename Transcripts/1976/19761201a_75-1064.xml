            <label>Mr. Norman J. Watkins</label>
            <text syncTime="148.064" offset="695672">That is correct, that is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.409" offset="709047">This suit was commenced in 1972 when the five named plaintiffs challenged their admission to Haverford State Hospital which was initiated under sections 402 and 403 of Pennsylvania's Mental Health Act and allowed generally parents to admit their children upon the advise of a recommending psychiatrist or physician whichever was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.009" offset="799431">The lawsuit basically challenged under the Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment, the authority of their parents and the physician to commence and effectuate this admission without the full panoply of Due Process.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.096" offset="863796">In Pennsylvania under sections 402 and 403, a parent may admit his child provided that medical recommendations are concurrent with that desire. Shortly after the litigation was commenced as Mr. Justice Rehnquist was alluding to earlier, regulations were adopted by the defendants which greatly expanded the rights of children under the Mental Health and Mental Retardation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.192" offset="956165">Generally those regulations and they are set out in full provide that a child over 13 is given elaborate notice and upon objection either written or oral, is automatically appointed counsel if he is unable to afford counsel and is provided a full adversarial hearing within which to contest both a parental recommendation and the medical recommendation.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.155" offset="1044041">The notice which is provided to child and must be explained to the child its extremely detail, provides the name of the physician who is recommending the commitment and provides the name of the applicant, the counsel, how to get a hold of counsel and various other procedural protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.436" offset="1109138">Moreover, in Pennsylvania now and shortly after the lawsuit, an admission of a child may not proceed on the basis of one medical recommendation alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.995" offset="1147382">It must be independently concordant by a second medical recommendation, plus it's under statement to say that in Pennsylvania, there are certain legal impediments for a parent who is intent on dumping a child in an institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.977" offset="1211329">The Lower Court view extensively both the statute and the regulations and held that both together fail to meet constitutional muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.258" offset="1248423">There was one judge dissenting holding basically that the regulations when viewed in the proper context of parent-child relationship involved in this case did indeed meet constitutional muster.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.167" offset="1291995">For this court, there are primarily two issues on the merits of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.159" offset="1307982">First, does the liberty interest that is involved in this involved the child's liberty interest, in the proper context warrants further protection under the constitution of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.932" offset="1355107">If the statutory and regulatory --</text>

            <text syncTime="319.760" offset="1382379">The new procedures and the old procedures, taken together, the statute and the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.724" offset="1398262">I think the record is very clear Mr. Chief Justice that the court and certainly the dissent exhaustively studied the regulations and considered them in its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.567" offset="1441625">As I recall the Lower Court's opinion, they rejected the regulations primarily because one, they did not applied to children under 13 and two, they did not provide a time certain when the adversarial hearing would take place.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.709" offset="1510170">There is a new statute that applies only to the mentally ill and as I pointed out, that is approximately 20% of the plaintiff class.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.502" offset="1545383">And the new statute changes in no way whatsoever, the relationship of the child-parent state who is under 14.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.586" offset="1581746">So for all intention purposes, a very small portion of the plaintiff class has been affected by the intervening legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.131" offset="1615914">The question is, is this statutory and regulatory framework deficient?</text>
            <text syncTime="383.607" offset="1637752">Are parents to be limited in the mental health area where they certainly are not in the physical health area?</text>
            <text syncTime="388.737" offset="1658337">Surely, if I as a parent seek to admit my child for a serious physical element that may require total incarceration, an Rh-negative problem or something where I have no antibiotic and any ability to ward off diseases, surely, no one would contend that a hearing must proceed that recommendation.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="409.457" offset="1741197">Well, is not there a question, Mr. Watkins, before you get to the question what kind of a hearing you have, or as to whether there is any state action here – the stilt is depriving anybody of liberty?</text>

            <text syncTime="422.114" offset="1791875">The question as I am approaching and I agree with you is whether or not there is a liberty interest involved at all here?</text>
            <text syncTime="428.526" offset="1817475">The conflict was the court -- lower court failed to perceive and I believe this is what you are getting to Mr. Justice Rehnquist, the conflict is between the parent and child, not between the parent and state.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.573" offset="1857703">In effect, there maybe no state action as compared to the Gault situation where you have got a state coming into the family and taking the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.940" offset="1899081">However, it is clear that the state is treating the patients and the plaintiffs pursuant to state law and the state is in fact holding the plaintiffs.</text>

            <text syncTime="1146.374" offset="4688854">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.732" offset="4710275">The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania begins the first year of its Third Century in an unprecedented role in appearing this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.398" offset="4756982">It is the first time and to that extent unique and perhaps emphasizes the importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.759" offset="4786448">It appears here in its administrative role under Article 5 of our new constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.403" offset="4812988">I say new, it was adopted in 1968 and we are going to still getting accustomed to some parts of it since it replaced a constitution almost a century old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.151" offset="4855933">Under that constitution, the Supreme Court is completely responsible for and mandate and the constitution mandates it or make to exercise supervisory and administrative authority over all the courts of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.072" offset="4927613">The constitution is quite specific in listing almost everything at least that I as the draftsman of that provision could think of that courts do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.483" offset="4973275">So that the Supreme Court would become as indeed of this -- the administrator of the Courts of Pennsylvania under the constitution that appoints an administrator and has done so and a distinguished former Justice of our Supreme Court who sits in this room.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.038" offset="5043493">But, if the appearance of the Supreme Court in this court is unique, even more unique is the action of the District Court in this case, and I think I am safe at least to the extent that the research of my associates and I go in saying that there is no case in which a Lower Court has conceded that there is no constitutional mandate upon it to call upon to command the state courts to take action and nevertheless did so, and did so in a drastic and completely absorbing manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.686" offset="5210154">The case proceeded through its entire trial, through the entire argument without so much as of unmentioned of the use of the courts, and even when it first appeared in our brief, we said that it first appeared in the proposed order of the plaintiffs that is not correct but appeared shortly before that as a footnote in the opinion of the court without any comment by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.439" offset="5337109">The court just blindly said, until the legislature acts, we command, then used those words until a legislature acts, the state court system shall carry on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.450" offset="5389145">They used the words initially and till it creates an unbiased tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.457" offset="5425194">In the final order it says, until the state legislature creates an alternate neutral tribunal and indeed my friend in his complaint simply asked for a disinterested and impartial decision maker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.866" offset="5494888">And then comes this footnote, then comes the order as a complete surprise to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.822" offset="5526653">There is this mandate to the courts and there is no mandate to the legislature indeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.045" offset="5547551">If there would have been an incentive on the legislature to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.941" offset="5559150">For example they had followed the accustomed procedure assuming their right substantively of simply saying this is the mandate to the Commonwealth and unless the Commonwealth acts, then all these people would be released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.165" offset="5615992">The public clamor would have made the legislature act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.393" offset="5628949">Today, there can not be any clamor, the District Court in its wisdom has said that this shall be saddled upon the state court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.740" offset="5666356">Now, it has been said that -- may I ask Your Honors after my friend finished, he was asked questions by the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1405.330" offset="5724662">Because I really think it is a very important matter to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.809" offset="5738559">The defendants, the Attorney General in his exceptions to that order made clear to the court his contention that this was outside the jurisdiction of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.429" offset="5789132">Now, this court has said so in many opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.583" offset="5801671">I refer primarily to Younger against Harris, where this court really pulled together the philosophy, pointed out that comity demands that the Federal Government would never interfere with state court systems unless under constitutional mandate and even then, with a greatest of reluctance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.946" offset="5891114">Now, I just quote one sentence, the most important the notion of comity, that is a proper respect for state functions and then the court later says, and a continuance of the belief that the national government will fair best if the states and their institutions are left free to perform their separate functions in their separate ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.667" offset="5982020">I said to Your Honors that this is unique, why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.399" offset="5996962">Here is a court that concedes but there is no constitutional mandate that the courts take this up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.666" offset="6022040">Indeed it says until a legislature creates a neutral administrative tribunal and nevertheless it mandates the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.382" offset="6056939">I may say mandates them in such a way that if the courts take up this task, they can do nothing else, for months ahead as the telegram from the Chief Justice of Pennsylvania to this court specifically said in describing the overwhelming and disrupting of the judicial system of Pennsylvania as he described it, which this would call us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.480" offset="6149308">Nevertheless, drastic as it is on the Courts of Pennsylvania, I suggest to Your Honors, that it is a more drastic deviation, a more drastic disregard of the mandates of this court, of the preachings of this court almost from its very beginnings at least from Chief Justice Marshall up to this court which has on three different occasions made clear that there will be no change in that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.853" offset="6250768">Now, I might say to Your Honors that there is a very serious question, whether forgetting the interest of the court system of Pennsylvania, the District Court did not disregard the interest of the people whom it really intended to help.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.319" offset="6328613">Whether the order would not create more harm than help for these youngsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.540" offset="6349511">I may say I happen to agree with Mr. Justice Rehnquist that the talk about 13 and 14 year olds does not represent the 1 and 2 year old anymore than a 14 year old child is represented by a 16 year old child that the question is can you drive when you can drive at 16, or an 18 year old child who can vote represents a 14 year old child who can not vote and so on, in states where 18 has become the voting age.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.972" offset="6475212">Now, my view is supported, and I believe this from the beginning when we got the brief of the most distinguished people in America on the subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.776" offset="6518471">The American Psychiatric Association, the American Society for Adolescent Psychiatry, the American Academy of Child Psychiatry, the American Association of Psychiatric Services for Children, all have said that this kind of adversary proceeding far from providing the ideal forum for such determination has a very great potential for harm to many individuals, particularly the younger individuals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1651.982" offset="6711254">Now, there is a waiver of some provisions permitted provided that counsel joins in it but he must first get counsel and these experts say Your Honors that an administrative model for tribunal that reviews such matters maybe the most effective and it happens, the American Psychiatric Association suggests a psychiatrist, a lawyer and another mental health professional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.135" offset="6831940">The Solicitor General of the United States has filed an amicus in which she takes the same position and suggests an independent board of psychiatrist or other professionals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.848" offset="6870810">But, I submit to Your Honors and I do not draw on my own experience which in this field has been rather considerable with institutions, that I do not think you can find an honest disagreement on the part of the profession, or at least the group of people in the profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.925" offset="6947088">Now, Your Honors, there are some points made by the defendants I believe, they are answered but we did not seek to become a party, it seems to me crystal clear that I see the white light is on, but I have two minutes according to my stopwatch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.773" offset="7022425">And I think your lights are out of guilt Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard G. Segal</label>
            <text syncTime="1734.656" offset="7041964">First, they argue that the Supreme Court did not ask to be a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.191" offset="7060146">Well, for heaven's sake, why would they ask to be a party when the plaintiff in its complaint asked for an administrative tribunal when the court never so much has mentioned to District Court that the courts would be involved until the opinion came down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.281" offset="7136528">When the opinion came down, nothing happened, until three months later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.417" offset="7161083">There was communication, almost three months, with the administrator's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.635" offset="7181876">Second, they say that the court never really had a chance to rule on this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.383" offset="7208939">Now that's not correct of course, because as I said the defendant's exception specifically raised it and finally they take the wholly unwarranted position and I quote, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court indicated that it would provide the hearings contemplated in the proposed order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.129" offset="7275917">What actually happened is a legal assistant in the administrator's office wrote a letter in which he said in which he said the courts would cooperate and provide for special masters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.999" offset="7331401">Well, it so happens first of all, that special masters would be invalid under the constitution of Pennsylvania, if they were given decisional authority and second, when it came to the Supreme Court, they just dismissed that out of hand and when you put in that special masters, the administrator had a commitment from Judge Hewitt, that Judge Hewitt would call him and would discuss these matters with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.401" offset="7425024">Instead of that Judge Hewitt called him one day and said “my order is being entered today, I am sorry but I have got to enter it so that people can appeal and I am sending you my order”, and the administrator wrote to him saying, “In view of that, we simply can't handle it in the court of Pennsylvania” That is the whole story, Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.065" offset="7495659">I suggest that the District Court acted without precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.954" offset="7511228">It acted unwisely, it acted unnecessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.485" offset="7525334">Its own opinion shows that administrative tribunal would have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.444" offset="7541112">If I were the judge, what I would simply have said is, assuming I was correct in a substance, that it is up to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to provide the hearings and if it does not, I would give what the results would have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.379" offset="7596910">I submit to Your Honors that at least in this respect, the order must be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.240" offset="7844342">The general issue in this case of whether the state may upon parental application institutionalize involuntarily and indeterminably juveniles in mental institution is a very great one and I think if the importance and implications of any rule in this matter demand that the court be aware of what is not before it and how narrow the issues in this case actually are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.076" offset="7959698">This case does not involve the issue of whether private facilities which are truly private, even if the mental health facilities must have hearings before a child is committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.776" offset="8006510">Pennsylvania law cited at page five with the one of my opinion makes it clear that on your Pennsylvania law of private facilities are required to use the provisions of the statutes that are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.166" offset="8068054">This case is unlike the Jackson versus Metropolitan, the electric case where all you had was a general state regulation and no action by the state regarding requirements or hearings before electricity terminations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.037" offset="8127509">This case does also not involve the standard of commitment where they have to be dangerous, severely, mentally ill to be committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.783" offset="8154467">The court made that very clear in footnote 4 of its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.309" offset="8168573">The case does not involve the self incrimination issue, kind of potential mental patient be forced to testify against him or herself.</text>

            <text syncTime="4092.394" offset="16472900">This has been discussed in the briefs and I discussed it a little more pointedly in my reply brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="4111.392" offset="16548968">But what the District Court ignored and what the plaintiff didn't bring to your attention just now is that in the most complete part of record, there are also medical diagnosis of the patients.</text>
