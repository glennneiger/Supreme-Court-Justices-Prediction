            <label>Mr. Sylvester Petro</label>
            <text syncTime="62.668" offset="351216">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.433" offset="378174">I represent the appellant, dissident school teachers in Detroit, who have declined willingly to pay dues to the appellee Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.148" offset="457064">The appellee, Board of Education of Detroit empowered by the Michigan Public Employment Relations Act had agreed with the appellee, a Federation of Teachers to forge the union henceforth to discharge the appellant teachers if they refuse to pay agency fees to the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.075" offset="572839">In other words, what we have here is what is known as an agency shop contract; a contract which makes the payment of fees normally equivalent to Union dues, a condition of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.091" offset="648907">The extraordinary aspect of this case of course is that this condition of employment is a condition not of private employment, but of public employment, an employment by a subdivision of the state of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.114" offset="724976">The teachers brought suit in the Michigan courts contending that the Board’s continuing threat of discharge if they fail to pay dues to the Union, constituted an outright per se indefensible violation of their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.252" offset="857469">They went further and alleged that the Michigan statute empowering the Board to reverse to condition employment was constitutionally overbroad as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.795" offset="931657">The case is here because the highest Michigan court to pass on the issue, the Supreme Court of Michigan having denied an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.635" offset="991007">While indeed it handed down a decision which is not very easy to state clearly, nevertheless seem to have dismissed out of hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.169" offset="1061120">No question whatsoever about it; those aspects of the complaint which alleged per se an indefensible unconstitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.681" offset="1115245">In what maybe the one clean-cut holding of the case, the Michigan Court of Appeals did say that the Michigan Para, Section 10, authorizing the agency shop was overbroad, in so far as it had to be construed according to the Michigan Court of Appeals as authorizing the Appellee Union to use the agency fees, let us say, in anyway the Union saw fit, subject of course to its own constitution and bylaws.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.962" offset="1316388">There is language in the opinion of the Michigan Court of Appeals to the effect that it is well recognized that the Union, in this case, engages in political action.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.791" offset="1367693">The statute does not confine the Union’s use of the exact of agency fees to only those things which we may call collective bargaining, but permits the use of the fees for the times of political conduct in which the Union normally engages.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.260" offset="1473541">Now, while holding that the statute did permit the Union to use the agency fees for purposes other than collective bargaining, including political purposes, the truth of the matter is that the court did not say that the statute was in consequence thereof unconstitutionally overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.395" offset="1622125">It is virtually impossible to avoid drawing the inference that if say we had unable to obscure the court to the wall and force it to make a comment one way or the other on this issue, it would have said, yes, the statute is unconstitutionally overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.343" offset="1717838">As a great judge once said of another case, the opinion is instinct with that commitment from the Michigan Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.312" offset="1765694">Still in the face, there is broad suggestion of unconstitutional overbreadth.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.624" offset="1818984">The Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the teachers’ petition for injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.400" offset="1858063">It affirmed the dismissal of the teachers’ case completely for that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.314" offset="1889724">Its idea seem to be that if somehow the teachers managed to get it to commit itself on the unconstitutionality of the statute, they should proceed by an action of one kind or another thereafter to recover from the Union the monies previously exacted and used by the Union unconstitutionally.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.141" offset="2037054">Well, it said in so many words the teachers would have such an action, did it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="495.662" offset="2083134">What it said is that the statute could violate the teachers’ rights.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="502.734" offset="2111451">I thought it said if the Union choose to spend monies that it had collected for political activities, the Court of Appeals described political activity, then an action would lie in Michigan Courts against the Union to recover.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sylvester Petro</label>
            <text syncTime="517.707" offset="2171324">That is what makes the case so extraordinarily difficult to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.756" offset="2191490">When the Court says it is not, that this statute is unconstitutionally overbroad, but says instead the statute could violate the teachers’ rights, all it has given as is another lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="555.176" offset="2321162">I would not think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.541" offset="2334641">You are talking mostly just about nomenclature rather than about the actual issues.</text>

            <label>Mr. Sylvester Petro</label>
            <text syncTime="566.432" offset="2366197">Well, our problem is that we were dismissed and we think that we were dismissed in spite of the fact that we have what the Michigan Court of Appeals very largely implied was a good constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.656" offset="2443102">Now, if you are correct, Justice Rehnquist, in suggesting that we won on that point then of course, the denial of release is inexplicable and plainly incompatible with everything this Court has had to say about violations of First Amendment rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="671.624" offset="2786978">It is only our clients who had refused for a good long while to pay the agency fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.790" offset="2823654">Still some have refused, but others under protest have because of the continued threats from the Detroit Board of Education to discharge them, they have now been paying agency fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.354" offset="2881959">As a matter of fact, the other side makes a great deal of this, acting as low, our clients have disqualified themselves from this suit because they have paid the fees under protest.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.011" offset="2936503">Now, this is perfectly understandable that they should do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.603" offset="2946952">Many of them have been Detroit school teachers for a good long while.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.269" offset="2961580">They are not about to give up their jobs even though maybe they will get reinstatement at some future time, but they have preserved their rights; their payments have been under protest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1245.470" offset="5082409">I shall go over them very rapidly because I do wish to save ten minutes for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.877" offset="5111980">Now, the first and I believe the most profound element in this case lies in the distinction between the activities of government and the activities of private persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.452" offset="5182302">Government is one thing and private persons and their activity are strictly another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.890" offset="5220023">There is a great deal made by the other side of the fact that collective bargaining, while collective bargaining in the private sector is the same thing as collective bargaining in the public sector, I believe that this lacks as much discernment has would be lacked by a person who said that all of the Fords that roll of a Ford assembling line are the same; it does not matter that one is driven by Sylvester Petro, a private person and the other is driven by a policeman and is owned by a police force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.725" offset="5343425">They look alike, but they are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.418" offset="5354187">The same thing is true, say, of the jet engines that are produced in such numbers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.811" offset="5379787">Some go into passenger commercial flights and others go into B1 bombers or B52.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.015" offset="5408522">You take that same engine, take it out of a passenger plane, put it into a bomber and you have got a different animal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.163" offset="5441123">In the same way, that activity of collective bargaining which looks as though it is exactly the same in the public sector as it is in the private sector is a different animal entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.759" offset="5511549">It is an animal that participates of the political character of a government that constitutes the employer and when that collective bargaining thus becomes political in character to ask or to insist that a public employee against his will, finance it, it is the same as forcing upon that public school teacher, political and ideological objectives which quite obviously cannot be squared with the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, a clear compromise of the dissident teachers’ political associational and speech rights is present in the case of this kind.</text>

            <text syncTime="1478.807" offset="6015712">Thank you, Your Honor. Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.710" offset="6031281">Perhaps in the remaining few minutes before the recess it would be profitable to indicate what this case does not involve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.799" offset="6063673">Clearly, I would suggest on state of the record and as the case comes before the Court, there is not a political expenditures issue dealing with the question that Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.236" offset="6121456">The Lower Court in fact decided favorably to the contention of appellants as to the use of agency shop monies for political purposes and made clear that where such money is to be expended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.388" offset="6190001">Over their objection, they would indeed have a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.793" offset="6207660">The complaint was dismissed in the instant case because in fact they had never made any appropriate protest on any timely fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.185" offset="6249247">It should be recalled if the Court please, that this complaint that is the initial complaint in Warczak of which Abood is virtually a carbon, was filed prior to the effective date of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.934" offset="6296267">In that circumstance, it was virtually identical to the Hanson case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.555" offset="6314762">Not withstanding which, the plaintiffs alleged although not one penny had been collected from anyone, nor of course therefore, nor have one penny been expended that the Union was somehow using the money for political purposes unspecified as to which the plaintiffs objected and they sought on that account not some remedy, discrete and referable to expenditures or alleged expenditures of a political nature, but they sought as in Hanson to avoid the obligation of the Agency Shop Clause entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.423" offset="6478184">They sought no relief whatsoever as to the claimed expenditures and they did not itemize or specify any specific compliant if any which they had.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.037" offset="6516636">They incanted their phrasing which presumably was intended to invoke a remedy which would set aside the clause entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.466" offset="6554357">Moreover during the entire pendency of the litigation, they have been excused from enforcement of the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.981" offset="6592392">There has been no discharge of any plaintiff appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.716" offset="6607334">There has been no other enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.999" offset="6624470">The fact of the matter is then that the Lower Court after first saying that the statute did not admit, as this Court had interpreted the Railway Labor Act within it, of the possibility of expenditure or non-expenditure over objections of dissenters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.219" offset="6709420">After saying that could present a constitutional dilemma, avoided the problem entirely by then agreeing with the contention of the plaintiffs and saying yes were that to happen, there would indeed be a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.248" offset="6781518">We did not cross appeal on that ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.504" offset="6794475">That is the fashion in which the matter comes before the Court in addition as we have pointed out in our brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1956.049" offset="7924741">Appellees would suggest that an appropriate evaluation of the central issue which is tendered, necessarily involves a consideration of the general Michigan Labor Code which is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.241" offset="7989420">Michigan, like many other states in extraordinary number has adopted a comprehensive Labor Relations Code which, in central and significant aspects, parallels the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.549" offset="8046681">And there are numerous decisions of our own State Supreme Court which have indicated as much and have indicated that the teachings of the Federal Act and indeed this Court’s interpretations of that Act are persuasive in terms of determining the significance and system of the State Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.187" offset="8121286">Part of that system includes not only the disciplinary measures and procedures which were before this Court in the last term in the Crestwood case involving anti-strike provisions, but involved affirmative features dealing with a process of collective bargaining, and in that respect, the Michigan statute like the federal, like the Nation Labor Relations Act, provides that where employees, in an appropriate bargaining unit have by democratic vote of majority of them, selected a representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.700" offset="8255242">The public employer, basically in the local sector, has responsibility to bargain in good faith with respect to wages, hours and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.442" offset="8298292">The elements of those concepts are, of course, entirely familiar to this Court and they are essentially of the same meaning in the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.690" offset="8327236">An aspect which is critical to an understanding of the state system and indeed of the issues in this case, is the proposition that the representative chosen under the Michigan scheme is the exclusive representative, but the exclusive representative based upon majority rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.678" offset="8391183">As such, as this Court has said several times, the organization is not a “private organization.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.793" offset="8415634">It is an organization which is clothed with certain legislative authority in the context of what is involved here as stated in Steele and Tunstall, it is an organization which has the authority that creates and extinguishes certain rights from the bargaining unit generally.</text>

            <text syncTime="2148.173" offset="8693159">The corollary it seems to me, which is critical to again, the understanding of what is essentially here to the proposition of exclusive representation, is that there is a duty, a fair representation on the part of the exclusive bargaining representative to all members of the bargaining unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.564" offset="8766720">It is perhaps not by accident that in appellant’s entire brief, there is not an acknowledgement of the concept of the duty of fair representation or a citation of Baker or Humphrey or Hines or any of the cases in which this Court has annunciated those familiar doctrines.</text>

            <text syncTime="2198.255" offset="8893466">Yes Your Honor, in a case called Lowe against the Restaurant Workers, it has essentially adopted the authorities expressed by this Court and indeed in a more recent case, by the State Court of Appeals called Handwerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.516" offset="8950517">The Court has said that the requirements of the state statute maybe perhaps are more strict than those imposed by this Court, and allow less discretion perhaps in terms of the bargaining agents’ authority to discontinue a grievance short of arbitration then this Court might permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.970" offset="9016346">In any event, the significance is that there is a very serious burden and a very serious responsibility imposed upon the bargaining agent to represent all, including the plaintiffs in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.523" offset="9074547">There has been no challenge in this complaint or in this argument by appellants and indeed there is a disclaimer to the concept of exclusive representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2253.950" offset="9116343">So that is not an issue before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.844" offset="9131912">Therefore, I would suggest that an appropriate corollary of the authority of the bargaining agent, indeed this Court has said virtually there is such a corollary in the part of the bargaining agent to speak for all, is to represent all fairly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.701" offset="9199307">Therefore that means that those, who whatever their exposition here, challenge the procedure of the statute, nevertheless have called upon the services of the organization which is required fairly and without any discrimination to render services and no claim has been made.</text>

            <text syncTime="3214.929" offset="12960209">The appellant’s petition on the grounds which they would bring here, we petitioned because we simply could not understand the purpose of the remand since there really was nothing that was not moot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.613" offset="13010991">Since there had been no compulsion, we could not understand what was viable for purposes of any remand and indeed the appellants seem to join with us in that quandary as to what the purpose of the remand was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.937" offset="13056235">In any event that is not before this Court, is not been presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.210" offset="13073371">I would simply want to emphasize that it seems that in the light of the precedence of this Court, there are no bases considering the parallel pattern of the Michigan statute to that of the federal statute if any genuine First Amendment issue or speech or association involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.345" offset="13145887">We are really back to the initiative, if the questions are here, we are back to those initial questions and it seems to me that the issue is what this Court characterized in the last term in the black lung benefits case; Usery v. Turner, Elkhorn as a legislative act adjusting the burdens and benefits of the economic life and that is all that is involved in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.834" offset="13235853">Such a statute, it seems to me, comes to this Court with a presumption of validity and it is for the plaintiffs not for the defendants to justify it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3355.600" offset="13522886">Now after that decision, the Michigan legislature proceeded immediately to pass the statute wanting as of the time of the Smigel decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.574" offset="13590805">Now, observe very carefully Honorable Justices, it was after the passage of that enabling agency shop provision that the contract in issue in this case was entered by the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.017" offset="13660604">If this does not establish a federal question, then I do not know what a federal question is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.553" offset="13686726">The contract involved in this case was entered by the parties after the passage of 1973 Michigan Para, Section 10.</text>

            <text syncTime="3553.910" offset="14316173">Then the only thing that this Michigan Court of Appeals, from which we are appealing, did with respect to that was saying no, there cannot be no --</text>
