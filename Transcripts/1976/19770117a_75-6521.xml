            <text syncTime="25.843" offset="206764">This case involves petitioner's claim that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars their retrial after reversal of their conviction on a duplicitous indictment for violation of the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.996" offset="259323">The petitioners were tried and convicted on a duplicitous indictment which charged in one count, two separate offenses, conspiracy and attempt to violate the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.125" offset="315852">Thereafter, they appealed to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals which reversed on other grounds and remanded for a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.240" offset="356289">Three times during the trial, initial trial of this case, petitioners moved to require the Government to elect to proceed on one prong or the other of the duplicitous indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.529" offset="405504">This, the Government steadfastly refused to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.666" offset="422013">But for the Government's steadfast refusal, this case would not be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.902" offset="455032">Now that the case has been remanded for retrial, the Government proposes to retry these petitioners on the conspiracy prong of the duplicitous indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.218" offset="500276">There are substantial problems with retrying these petitioners on the conspiracy prong, one of which is the indictment as now framed simply fails to state a federal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.896" offset="554924">The indictment now charges conspiracy to commit attempt extortion, something which simply isn't not a crime under the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.514" offset="593377">The other problem, of course, is that retrying these petitioners on one prong of the duplicitous indictment will expose them to double jeopardy.</text>

            <text syncTime="169.597" offset="781772">In -- in this Court, the Government has raised the question of jurisdiction and I would direct myself to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.947" offset="823150">The Appellate Court Jurisdiction Act confers on the Courts of Appeals' jurisdiction to hear final decisions of the District Courts, a well-known Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.742" offset="874350">We believe, and we believe that there is substantial precedent for the idea that the denial of motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds is, in fact, a final decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.964" offset="919280">And if the Court of Appeals properly assumes jurisdiction over that question, this Court, in Harris versus Washington, addressed a substantially similar issue and held that the – the Court had proper jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C Section 1257, the standards of which has held -- been held or has been approached by this Court on the same basis as the standards of finality under Section 1291.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ralph David Samuel</label>
            <text syncTime="251.624" offset="1109870">The case is not similar because the federal appellate system permits a review only by a writ of prohibition in the intermediate state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.795" offset="1146546">Here, obviously, the Court of Appeals would have the power to entertain a motion for a writ of prohibition so that there was no special appellate statute involved in that case.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.977" offset="1199313">Well, but if there's a policy against piecemeal appeals in the federal system, that policy may or may not be followed by the States and if they'd choose or chosen to allow their process to be interrupted by appellate review of this kind of an issue, that's up to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.578" offset="1273710">But I take it the argument of the other side is that the federal policy is against that sort of thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="298.412" offset="1297011">Well, I think that the -- the discussion by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in the Cobbledick case is particularly appropriate here where he noted that the right to statutory appeal must not be interpreted in such a way as to deny all opportunity for appeal under -- contemplated by the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.415" offset="1393037">In other words, he said, exactly, due regard for efficiency in litigation must not be carried so far as to deny all opportunity for the appeal contemplated by the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.635" offset="1433893">Now, the nature of the protection in a Double Jeopardy Clause is such that it creates the statutory right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.605" offset="1477778">It is -- there – there is no decision more final than the decision of a trial court cutting off a Double Jeopardy claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.814" offset="1514663">The only event looming on the horizon of the accused at that point is the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.394" offset="1544965">The -- the issues are -- are completely dissimilar, the issues on the question of Double Jeopardy and the issue to be tried in the second trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.337" offset="1652694">-- with that that the -- the nature to protection again is based on the Fifth Amendment, which bars a second trial, and this Court has so held it in a long line cases from Ex parte Lange through United States versus Ball and most recently, in United States versus Dinitz.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.850" offset="1726777">In that sense, it is a – a very special type of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.745" offset="1750392">It involves a decision of the District Court whether or not to violate the protection, and -- and there really is no other constitutional protection quite like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.111" offset="1803786">If any decision is final, this one should be in light of, for instance, Stack versus Boyle where this Court held that the question of bail could be appealed pre trial because it was final decision and that it was collateral and did not merge with the trial issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.165" offset="1884035">Here, we have the same -- the same type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.721" offset="1898245">The question of -- of double jeopardy does not merge.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.404" offset="1916949">It is a -- a collateral issue and the issues -- there are no facts required to be adduced at trial to bear on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.222" offset="1964283">All of the necessary record facts are before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.884" offset="1994898">The Government has become apparently quite concerned about the jurisdictional issue and I know recently that Mr. -- that Judge Friendly in the Second Circuit has written an extensive opinion in which he discusses the question of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.875" offset="2082879">I would be arguing with blinders on if I were not -- do not take cognizance of the concern of the courts that granting the right of appeal from this type of decision would open the floodgates and that every criminal defendant would immediately a double jeopardy claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.763" offset="2186428">I think that that analysis misses a very important distinction, and that distinction is between the appellate jurisdiction, that is, does the -- the question is does the Appeals Court have jurisdiction to entertain and to hear these cases which we argue on the one hand and the question of whether or not every defendant has a right to have this trial stayed which is really a separate question.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.455" offset="2293217">And the practice is, today, in the eastern District of Pennsylvania, where this case arose, that the -- the courts do not consider that every appellant has a right to have his trial stayed.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.212" offset="2348178">And that the appellant must seek a stay based on the merits of this to having a substantial double jeopardy claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.531" offset="2377540">And of course that, really has kept the floodgates from opening because the Government has only been able to point to 10 cases in which appeals have been entertained in four years since Lansdown was decided which -- in the Fourth Circuit, which created initially the -- or held initially that this was a final decision appropriate for appellate review.</text>

            <text syncTime="626.412" offset="2608985">And again, the -- the words of Mr. Justice Frankfurter I think, are very appropriate as a due regard for efficiency and litigation, must not be carried so far to deny all opportunity for the appeal contemplated by the statutes, but even if --</text>

            <text syncTime="1323.714" offset="5398235">That is, that the District Court, in denying the motions to dismiss here, held that he had no basis to reach the merits following the Third Circuit's opinion after the appeal of the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.335" offset="5460720">He felt that the Third Circuit opinion precluded him from reaching the merits and -- and made his decision accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.344" offset="5496769">Now that we think that's an abdication of nisi prius jurisdiction that the issue of double jeopardy had not been argued, briefed or decided by the Third Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1371.786" offset="5590497">Turning to the double jeopardy argument itself, the Third Circuit, in reviewing the decision, the indictment held that it was duplicitous and noted the evils of a duplicitous indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.746" offset="5666356">These are confusion and ambiguity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.908" offset="5679000">These are well-known.</text>

            <text syncTime="1398.055" offset="5695613">The principal evil of an -- a duplicitous indictment is that it requires the jury to answer two separate questions with one yes or no answer, something which is almost beyond the -- the scope of logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.040" offset="5767502">Accordingly, a guilty verdict under such a -- an indictment is -- is capable of various equally possible interpretations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1426.660" offset="5810030">One such interpretation is that the jury found the defendants not guilty of the conspiracy charge and we believe that because of -- of the presumption of innocence that we must adopt the most favorable of the equally possible interpretations, that being that the defendants were found not guilty of the charge on which they are now sought to be retried by the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.610" offset="5921834">That presents a clear double jeopardy situation and their retrial should be barred.The Government argues in its brief that the act of appealing to the Third Circuit from the first conviction wipes clean the slate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.119" offset="6071881">That is the general rule and it is a general rule which exists and we -- we agree with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.796" offset="6098526">This is a situation where the petitioners claim that they were acquitted of the conspiracy charge the first time around, taking the -- adopting the most favorable interpretation of this ambiguous guilty verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.263" offset="6152443">Accordingly, appeal from the first conviction cannot have the affect of wiping clean an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.949" offset="6183163">It simply -- simply cannot be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.342" offset="6192776">The -- once acquitted, the petitioners are forever barred from having to stand trial a second time on the same charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.035" offset="6239483">The Government also argues that the charge of the District Court at the -- the trial court on the first trial cured the -- the infirmity of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.084" offset="6287757">The Government cites no law for this proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.090" offset="6303744">It seems that it is completely unfounded and moreover, the charge of the Court, which is set forth in full beginning at page 11 of the appendix, demonstrates beyond peradventure, that the charge of the Court was just as confusing as the indictment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.984" offset="6387336">Accordingly, we request that this Court hold that the Court of Appeals had proper appellate jurisdiction to review the dismissal -- the denial of the motion is dismissed, reversed, the Court of Appeals with -- and remand with instructions to dismiss the indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1604.796" offset="6522546">Since the Government deems the issue of appealability to be the most important of those raised in this case, I would like to defer the statement of our position on the other substantive issues unless and until the Court otherwise desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.162" offset="6588061">It's the position of the Government in this case that the interruption of the trial process by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals was not justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.005" offset="6631424">That Court was without jurisdiction to hear an appeal from an order denying dismissal on double jeopardy grounds before the case was retried following its reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.633" offset="6681893">The right to appeal is a statutory one, not a constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.673" offset="6706030">It arises in this case under the provisions of Title 28 USC § 1291 which provides for a right of appeal only of final decisions in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.479" offset="6861302">The question is whether it is a final decision as the courts have interpreted that phrase under 1291, and I would suggest that beginning with a line of authority that's founded in the Hickey case that in matters respecting double jeopardy, there has been with the exception of the cases that bring us here today from the Circuit Courts, a recognition by this Court that a double jeopardy claim denial is not final, a final decision for the purposes of being appealable.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard L. Thornburgh</label>
            <text syncTime="2033.963" offset="8239208">Well, I would submit that at that time, it might well have been thought to encompass such a right because it -- the statute was a substitute for the Fifth Amendment right, which prohibits the use of testimony in an incriminating sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.230" offset="8332309">So I think that there is a -- as the Court noted in Hickey, a distinct parallel to the transactional immunity argument and the double jeopardy argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.953" offset="8383195">Indeed, the Court in Hickey noted and more or less assumed that a -- a claim of double jeopardy would be treated in the same way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.949" offset="8427186">That is, that -- that it would not have the affect of interrupting the process but would have to await determination of the case itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.188" offset="8464175">Now, Hickey, in a sense, I would submit, if it -- it remains good law today and we urge that it does, really answers the questions that are raised in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.359" offset="8536795">I think what has happened that the development that brings us to the consideration of the double jeopardy question out of the Circuits today represents the false sense that have been followed in a number of circuit courts which have lead them, on the basis of Cohen, into a path of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.898" offset="8654973">I think, as I mentioned first of all, they have looked at the seductive argument of the uniqueness of double jeopardy drawing on cases like Ball and Green which contained descriptive language about the double jeopardy right which are unassailable, but said not in the context of the appealability of a pre-trial order denying a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.642" offset="8797915">This is an argument that was really first raised in the Fifth Circuit in Gilmore where now, Chief Judge Brown, noted that all appeal rights are statutory and not constitutional and then continued in dealing with double jeopardy as follows and I quote, “There are many instances in which it is ultimately determined that constitutional rights have been violated, but the nature of the asserted right, that is to say, a constitutional one, does not distinguish appellate review of any such question from the assertion of other rights, whether statutory or common law or from a procedural rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.275" offset="8972518">At least, so long as a criminal case is pending, review of such matters as for example, unlawful search and seizure, unlawful arrest, unlawful detention, unlawful indictment, unlawful confession must await the trial and its outcome.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.650" offset="9037928">The Fourth Circuit in Lansdown disagreed and enunciated a view of Cohen which has found double jeopardy claims to be collateral in the Cohen sense and in gender, the line of cases that bring us here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2250.061" offset="9103653">The premise on which these holdings of the Courts of Appeal rely has not been examined in this Court since Hickey, and needless to say, it has not occasioned any action by the Congress to extend the scope of review of interlocutory orders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.851" offset="9174810">I think, when you examine the rationale in Lansdown, in the Fourth Circuit, against the rationale expressed for denying these rights of interlocutory appeal in Cobbledick, Justice Frankfurter's opinion of 1940, the deficiency in the Courts of Appeals' reasoning appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.656" offset="9266030">That is to say, in Lansdown, the Court said, “Even if an appellate court reverses the conviction in a second trial on the grounds of double jeopardy, a defendant has still not been afforded the full protection of the Fifth Amendment since he has been subjected to the embarrassment, expense, anxiety and insecurity involved in the second trial.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.723" offset="9366235">Compare this with Justice Frankfurter's language in Cobbledick where he said to the point, “Bearing the discomfiture and cost of a prosecution for crime even by an innocent person is one of the painful obligations of citizenship.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.124" offset="9435826">That is a painful document – doctrine, I will acknowledge, but as pointed out by Judge Brown, there are numerous cases where an error can be made by the District Court that will occasion embarrassment, expense, anxiety and insecurity to a defendant who later obtains a reversal of a conviction that was obtained through error.</text>

            <text syncTime="3289.660" offset="13262033">I would like to take my remaining time to address the merits, briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.544" offset="13285543">The case as presented by the petitioner states that because of the duplicity of the indictment, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine what the verdict was in the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.005" offset="13367359">I think a search of the record, particularly the charge of the Court in this case, with its final words to the jury being emphasized, makes it clear that what the Government was doing here was not overreaching as the petitioner alleges but underreaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.332" offset="13428694">They were setting a task much greater for themselves, which I would certainly not want to do of securing convictions on both of these offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.932" offset="13467146">The trial judge defined the statute in terms of conspiracy or attempt and then proceeded to charge on the necessity of convicting for conspiracy and attempt, even going to the length in his last words to the jury of pointing out that both of those offenses had to be, result in conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.283" offset="13544469">I don't think that we can assume that the jury did not follow those instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.726" offset="13574248">The colloquy which is relied upon by counsel for the petitioner was not communicated to the jury and I think what we must do is -- is to look at those instructions that were given to the jury and they clearly indicate that they were under an -- a charge to convict of both offenses, conspiracy and attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.215" offset="13652198">And in that event, it strikes me that we -- we need proceed no further.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.834" offset="13674663">Now, with respect to the statement of an offense, the so-called pendent claim, if one refers to the brief and our analysis of the Hobbs Act, the -- the charge, it's -- it seems clear that the acts of what is charged is that the acts amounting to attempted extortion were performed in furtherance of a properly alleged conspiracy and that there was no failure to charge in the terms of the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.372" offset="13800887">So, that I think that when we do get to the merits after this trail regarding the appealability of pre-trial, that we find, indeed, that if this is the type of claim that is going to inject itself into our appellate process, willy-nilly, on a piecemeal basis, we will suffer considerable delay and misuse of appellate time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3468.929" offset="13979042">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.395" offset="13996910">Turning first to the last comments of -- of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.538" offset="14041527">The indictment here is reproduced at page 9 of the appendix and it -- it only takes up a-- a short -- excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.529" offset="14093458">I may have -- page 5 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.011" offset="14107460">It only takes up a little bit more than a page and that it really is very instructive to read that indictment because that indictment does not charge, properly charge a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.122" offset="14155839">It does not charge any agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.931" offset="14167124">It charges a conspiracy and attempt by attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.613" offset="14189798">There is no language in there to suggest in anyway that these defendants agreed to commit an attempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3531.253" offset="14228355">They charge they attempt it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3533.268" offset="14236400">It doesn't say that they attempt it together, that they agreed to attempt they -- that they -- they conspire in any way, except the -- the single bare word conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.938" offset="14279137">For that reason, we believe that the indictment fails to state an offense because now with the attempt portion of the charge deleted, it charges a conspiracy to commit attempted extortion, which we have noted is not a crime under the Hobbs Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.222" offset="14348309">The -- the charge of the Court cannot, we -- we submit, correct the deficiencies of the duplicitous indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.386" offset="14388955">The charge at page 22 of the appendix talks about the charge against each individual defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.951" offset="14447156">Now, here, we have two separate charges.The Court lumps them together as the charge.He then goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.095" offset="14483728">On page 26 of the appendix, the offense charged, lumps them together again and so forth throughout the remaining part of the charge of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.915" offset="14539003">Now, the -- the position of the -- of the petitioners is that -- that where there are two separate charges, where there is a duplicitous indictment to lump them together as one, creates something which is incognizable by the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.530" offset="14605458">It -- the jury is considering something which is completely separate from the two crimes charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.841" offset="14626774">They're -- they are asked to consider something which is -- which is not within the province of the criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.158" offset="14675989">Turning back to the appealability question, I think it's important to note that -- that the petitioners here are not trying to get into the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.588" offset="14717680">They are not testing their right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.529" offset="14725517">They were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.183" offset="14728129">The question is, did the Third Circuit have appropriate and proper federal jurisdiction to consider their claims and -- and that I think is an -- an important question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3666.057" offset="14767626">The -- in reaching that question, the question of finality becomes very important whether or not it is a final decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.446" offset="14805138">And in Stack versus Boyle, very similar situation to this where bail was considered to be a final decision and reviewable pre-trial and whether or not the trial went on before the Appellate Court reached that, made no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.104" offset="14871803">The fact is, is that the -- the appellants in Stack versus Boyle had a right to have the Appellate Court reach the question of whether the bail was excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.789" offset="14906493">In Harris versus Washington, here, I think Harris is a very important case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.745" offset="14930317">Albeit in utilizing the state courts, but the -- it was a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds in the trial court which was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.466" offset="14973262">A writ of prohibition was entered by the Court of Appeals and reversed by the State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.237" offset="14992280">So, this Court had before it only one issue whether or not the denial of a -- of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds was a final judgment in the words of that statute, for purposes of review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.893" offset="15058944">And as we pointed and as the Government agrees, the criteria for final judgment and final decision are the same and have been held to be the same.</text>
