            <text syncTime="58.660" offset="335342">This is an appeal from a criminal conviction of Mrs. Iñez Moore in East Cleveland, Ohio Municipal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.609" offset="363136">Mrs. Moore is a grandmother.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.701" offset="371495">She was convicted under a city ordinance for living in her own home with her own two sons and her two grandsons.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.975" offset="400648">She appealed the conviction to the Ohio County Court of Appeals, which affirmed with one judge dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.052" offset="428964">Her conviction was further appealed to the Ohio Supreme Court which dismissed the appeal for want of a substantial constitutional question and the case was further appealed here.</text>

            <text syncTime="97.885" offset="492285">That five-day prison sentence was suspended on the condition that she, by July 1st , 1974, which was roughly 45 days after the conviction was handed down, that she put her grandson, John Jr., out of her home.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.966" offset="552576">She has failed to do that, pending the appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.228" offset="573578">It is the appellant's position in this case that the East Cleveland ordinance, which prevents many family members from living together with their families in the city of East Cleveland, substantially interferes with fundamental rights of privacy and association in matters of family life.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.964" offset="636586">This ordinance is both over-broad and violated of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.472" offset="658633">And the justifications offered by the city in support of this ordinance simply do not support the substantial interference of constitutional rights.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edward R. Stege, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="157.018" offset="728746">Well, I am suggesting that all the cases such as, for example, such as Row v. Wade, the abortion decisions, when a State passes a statute that interferes, I think the Danford case of last term, which interferes too seriously with a fundamental right such as, in that case, the right of privacy, the right to control the decision to terminate one’s pregnancy, that in a sense if the statute interferes too deeply with that fundamental right, it is truly over-broad.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="189.656" offset="859358">It is one thing to say that the statute violates the right in question, and therefore, it cannot stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.128" offset="885271">It is another thing to say, as I think of the term “over-breadth” to me, that it covers areas that it should not cover so that even though it does not violate any right in this case, we are not going to let it apply because it may infringe on rights in other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.850" offset="948070">Which meaning do you adopt?</text>

            <text syncTime="216.048" offset="964893">I take it the fundamental right you are talking about are perhaps, at least you raised in that is the right of a person to give a home to a near relative who is in need, that is, the grandchildren here.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.380" offset="1026228">Where do you place that fundamental right?</text>

            <text syncTime="259.527" offset="1138868">I think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.240" offset="1141689">I think the fundamental right here does not arise from any one single point in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.869" offset="1168230">It arises from several different influences in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.013" offset="1184739">First of all, it arises from the line of cases beginning with Skinner v. Oklahoma, which discuss and afford protection to the right to procreate, the right to create a family, the right to determine the extent of one’s own family.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.440" offset="1246493">That is one clearly defined source of constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.530" offset="1266868">The second line of cases is that line beginning with Myron v. Nebraska and continuing on through the Yoda case, the school education case, which gives parents and which gives persons within the family the rights to control the very upbringing of the members of the family, particularly the minor children, to make decisions about the rearing of those children, the secular, the moral education of those children.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.597" offset="1371149">Thirdly, we have the associational interest involved, which had been recognized most specifically in the Meryl context in Griswold and Eisenstead, which I think also extend to the relationships among family members.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.430" offset="1650450">I am conceding that there could be a cut-off point but for a very different purpose than this ordinance is designed.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.675" offset="1675423">The purpose would only be to determine at what very attenuated point in the family blood lines, do family members who are related to the thirty-second degree, let us say, stand in effect as strangers to one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.445" offset="1730489">That would be the sole function of that kind of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.224" offset="1741565">I would emphasize that I do not think that that kind of examples has a lot of practical significance for a city like East Cleveland.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.938" offset="6748507">He was not living in the premises in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.068" offset="6768987">Further, we would like to point out again from the Appendix of appellee’s brief that the initial citation occurred in January 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.267" offset="6817784">From that point until April 1974, the Housing Department of the City of East Cleveland worked with the appellant in trying to resolve this question of occupancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.102" offset="6869089">It was not until April 1974 that this matter was taken to Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1706.375" offset="6926244">Your Honor, the procedure with respect to Code citations are to notify the party involved, either ask them to call the Housing Department to set up a conferences with them to find out what can be done to correct the situation, including conferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.830" offset="6992073">There is nothing in the record but I can only make this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.821" offset="7019972">In a usual situation like this, the housing inspector, if there is a possibility of a variance, would make a verbal response to that person involved in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.717" offset="7071590">But again, there is nothing in the record to reflect that and I could not find anything in the record of the Housing Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="1757.871" offset="7132194">When you look at this situation, you have to look at the entire Housing Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.781" offset="7151838">One of the things that I focus on at this point is that under the Housing Code, there is the sub-tenant (ph) group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.888" offset="7184230">They are, for example, and I take exception with regards to hardships.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.556" offset="7210979">With regards to a variance, a showing of hardship is made if it can be done in harmony with the ordinance, that is, to maintain the safety, the welfare of the community, variances are granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.883" offset="7280256">In this situation, the record does not reflect it and to my knowledge there was no showing of any need or any hardship as to why the grandson should remain in the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.266" offset="7329784">Again, I go back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.823" offset="7336053">If these arguments made on behalf of the appellant were made by John Moore, Sr. involving personal rights, I think you would have a different situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.440" offset="7382447">But here, you have the appellant, a grandmother making these arguments of personal rights in which there is no guardianship, no adoption on her part of John Moore, Jr. Therefore, these are the types of things that John Moore, Sr., as a natural parent, has a right to determine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1855.811" offset="7523926">The nominal head of the household, in this case would be the appellant - she is listed as the owner of the premises, can have one unmarried child with her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.709" offset="7567498">Also, in the situation says he had a son, Dale Sr. was there and Dale Jr. was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.263" offset="7601771">Looking at the total situation, the premises could accommodate the three individuals that the Housing Department would not give a citation on that type situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.907" offset="7656315">When you bring in John Jr. who is there at that point, you have exhausted the ordinance which allows the unmarried son to be there.</text>
