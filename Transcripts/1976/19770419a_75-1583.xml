            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100561">We will resume arguments in 1583.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.204" offset="113309">Mr. Bell.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="randall_t_bell" startTime="9.893" stopTime="256.257">
            <label>Mr. Randall T. Bell</label>
            <text syncTime="9.893" offset="140058">Mr. Chief justice, and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.361" offset="162001">We are astonished that anyone could come in to this court and suggest, as we understood counsel, yesterday to suggest first that South Carolina is deliberately evading the provisions of Section 5 for Voting Rights Act in this case, and second the Attorney General in 1972 did not look at the submission of our senate plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.376" offset="258027">We believe that both of these suggestions are flatly contradicted by the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.481" offset="286448">It has been said, that after the objection was entered pursuant to the court order in Harper v. Levi in 1973, that South Carolina has continued to enforce its plan, rather than coming up with a new reapportionment or submitting to the District Court of the District of Columbia, an action seeking a declared court judgment that the plan is enforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.240" offset="393446">Now, of course, from 1973 until commencement of this suit, the judgment of that District Court was in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.169" offset="429181">It was appealed by the United States to the Court Of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.509" offset="450497">Judge Green in her District Court order specifically said that the order was without prejudice to any right of appeal on the issue, and so we fail to see how that constitutes bad faith or evasion on our part.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.391" offset="506086">We feel also that the record of South Carolina’s compliance with the Voting Rights Act, since its inception should dispel the notion that there is any bad faith or evasion on our part in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.087" offset="556868">We promptly submitted this plan, we mailed it off three days after the Governor signed it in to law, which is, I think is very prompt compliance, in 1972, South Carolina has always complied with the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.407" offset="614128">We are quite proud that we are the only covered jurisdiction and this court has judicially noticed in Perkins v. Matthews that we are the only covered jurisdiction that is rigorously and faithfully complied with the Section 5 pre-clearance provision since the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.832" offset="675882">We did so in this case, the Attorney General determined that our submission was complete, which we think was his determination to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.188" offset="705243">We think, this court clearly said that, in Georgia v. United States, and so we fail to see where the evasion is on our part.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.045" offset="740665">Where is our bad faith?</text>
            <text syncTime="163.604" offset="754876">In fact, we feel that the record indicates the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.041" offset="768669">Now, the record also shows that the Attorney General did look at our submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.726" offset="795418">All of the testimony in the record, all of the evidence in the record points in that direction that nothing to indicate that agency action was withheld which was repeatedly suggested yesterday.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.215" offset="837319">Quite obviously, agency action was not withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.391" offset="850066">The Attorney General received the submission, he reviewed the submission, he reviewed the plan and he acted, it is because he acted, and not because he failed to act, that we have this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.486" offset="898445">The Plaintiffs disagree with that action but it simply is not plausible to claim that he did not look at the plan or did he totally withheld Agency Action, or that he did not review it at all, so that is not the case we are arguing here, it is a case in which the Attorney General did receive the submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.480" offset="982455">If there is any question about that I think it is a dispelled by looking at the memorandum he filed with District Court a year later, in which he said, we have again reviewed this submission and we find that our decision there was sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.900" offset="1052150">That is the same letter in which he went on to say that the plan had a substantial racial effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.813" offset="1079735">But he starts that memorandum by saying, we have reviewed all of this again, that indicates that he had reviewed it once before and he said we have reached the same conclusion, that that conclusion was sound.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="256.257" stopTime="258.517">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="256.257" offset="1125501">That letter is an Appendix here somewhere.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="randall_t_bell" startTime="258.517" stopTime="391.611">
            <label>Mr. Randall T. Bell</label>
            <text syncTime="258.517" offset="1134592">Yes, Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.026" offset="1144623">You will find that letter is on page in the Appendix starting at Page 51.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.559" offset="1194778">I am sorry that is the objection letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.430" offset="1202197">The memorandum which I am referring is reprinted in the Red Brief in the Appendix there, and you will find that begins on Page 4(a) of that Appendix and the language I am referring to is in the first paragraph of that memorandum.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.390" offset="1278057">It says there, "we have again examined our files to determine whether the conclusion reached, and the reasons for that decision are sound, we conclude again that they were".</text>
            <text syncTime="305.784" offset="1323614">So we think that the record, the facts in this case simply do not support most of the arguments that were being made yesterday in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.693" offset="1379307">It seems to me that to adopt that the position which was urged before the court yesterday, is quite clearly going to create significant problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.403" offset="1418073">If the court decides to review under the Administrative Procedure Act is permitted, I think yesterday’s argument gave us a good foreshadowing of what is going to happen, we are going to have a host of collateral issues being raised in lawsuits on this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.051" offset="1484737">All of these will have to be resolved in future litigation, I do not think those issues are right for adjudication in this court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.619" offset="1510964">They will have to be resolved, in collateral suits in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.643" offset="1531131">Some of the issues that were raised in the questioning yesterday are very difficult issues, who can seek review.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.754" offset="1559552">Private parties, the submitting authority, both.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.516" offset="1574599">Can private parties seek review of objections as well as non-objections, and I think the difficulty of that question is shown by the fact that the private parties in the United States disagreed on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.848" offset="1615872">Mr. Wollenberg said, private parties can not.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.070" offset="1624754">Mr. Turner said they can if there is some fundamental error that led to the objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.094" offset="1652861">That is a difficult question which would have to be resolved.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="391.611" offset="1666968">Suppose that the Attorney General does not object, or suppose he specifically says that he is not planning to object.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.634" offset="1707092">He says he's carefully reviewed the plan and the state statute goes in to effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.651" offset="1743141">May a private party then bring an independent suit to enjoin the operation of the statute, not on constitutional grounds but on the ground that it does not comply with Section 5?</text>

            <text syncTime="437.005" offset="1848571">I think the problem, and I think it is a significant problem; there are certainly reasons why private parties should be allowed in certain circumstances to litigate that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.747" offset="1891516">I think the way that has been handled so far and it seems to be something that is acceptable to Congress, but Congress has not changed the Act, it is a liberal rule of intervention, now private parties have intervened...</text>

            <text syncTime="609.181" offset="2537263">Now, the reason Section 5 was enacted, and I think this is quite clear is because traditional suits were considered not to be an adequate remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.384" offset="2578014">But why weren’t they considered to be an adequate remedy, there was a very specific problem that Congress was addressing.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.901" offset="2604137">It was a practice which they had seen occur and in some states in the South on a massive basis of undercutting successful Fifteenth Amendment litigation, private parties would have a voting qualification, stricken as unconstitutional they would win their case and the state would react by changing the qualifications, so that there had to be new litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.013" offset="2692535">Now pre-clearance and the suspension effect of Section 5 has taken care of that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.232" offset="2717403">So that the subsequent contest on the merits, the constitutional contest now is the effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="711.499" offset="2946550">To my knowledge, no suit has been -- a substantive Section 5 suit has not been brought in a local District Court when the Attorney General has not objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.620" offset="2995033">Another reason it's hard to cite authorities because this case is one of the first cases in which someone challenged the Attorney General’s non-objection by bringing an action other than the subsequent contest on the merits provided in Section 5, which we think is the remedy that Congress intended to be available and we think it is an adequate remedy today because there would be no undercutting of judgments which was the problem that Section 5 was addressed to in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.459" offset="3126377">I think, at the time Congress extended the Act in 1975, there was no decision of this court which would indicate that the substantive standard of Section 5 is clearly different from the Fifteenth Amendment standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.428" offset="3198265">Some members of the court feel that the standard is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.004" offset="3212476">The substantive standard both under the Fifteenth Amendment and under Section 5, and so I do not think Congress was dealing with a situation of which this court has announced a clear rule that substantive Section 5 coverage was different from substantive constitutional coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.926" offset="3284261">So that it would have to deal with that issue by amending Section 5 or leaving Section 5 the way it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.407" offset="3310174">It seems to me that that was the issue in the Beer case which came after the 1975 extension, and as I say, it seems to me from my reading of that case that the court had not made up its mind on the issue yet, and certainly it is a difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.639" offset="3375062">I think our view would be that Congress has resolved that question by saying “Here is the subsequent suit, why would Congress take care to preserve that suit, if it was not because it foresaw exactly the factual situation we have here, private parties disagreeing with the non-objection by the Attorney General".</text>
            <text syncTime="838.797" offset="3455728">It seems to me that’s why Congress was careful to preserve that subsequent contest on the merits.</text>

            <text syncTime="892.214" offset="3669410">It seems to me though that the question of purpose and effect is often one in which no bright line can be drawn, and that the Attorney General, if that standard is different clearly could object and if he found a clear discriminatory effect, I think if that standard is different that that would certainly be a possibility for him to object.</text>

            <text syncTime="939.980" offset="3860417">The Attorney General was faced with the situation in which a previous plan, similar to the plan that is now before the court had been objected to in March of that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.054" offset="3912767">But the objection was not based on a reasoned decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.390" offset="3938053">He said “I can not make up my mind”, therefore under my burden of proof standard in my regulations interpose objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.738" offset="3967415">He said “we are unable to reach a conclusion”.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.224" offset="3977446">That is what he said in March, to Act 932.</text>
            <text syncTime="972.582" offset="3990821">Now when he received Act 1205, the plan we are talking about now, in June the situation had changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.629" offset="4026974">For one thing, constitutional court had found that there was no discriminatory purpose behind that plan and in fact, the plaintiffs in that case had conceded that there was no discriminatory purpose behind the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.284" offset="4089668">So, he was dealing with a situation in which parties to that litigation had conceded that there was no discriminatory purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.393" offset="4638030">He first says, “we think that our function is to do what the District Court of the District of Columbia would do”.</text>

            <text syncTime="1162.144" offset="4749103">Then he goes on and explains that a little bit more, it seems to me that he indicates other factors besides just the fact that that judgment had been entered in the constitutional case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1560.819" offset="6343826">Precisely and we think that is what Congress has said and what this court said in Allen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.033" offset="6372665">Congress knew that the Attorney General did not make a reasoned decision on the merits in 1975 and they did not change the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.049" offset="6408714">Mr. Turner suggested yesterday that they or I understood him to suggest that they always give reasons, when they make a response but his guidelines say that they do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.284" offset="6445599">If he fails to object or says no objection 51.20 of the guidelines say nothing about him giving reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1593.350" offset="6473916">If he objects, under the section dealing with notification of decision to object, it says that sub (a) that he will give reasons there and Congress knew that the interpretation of Section 5 was that he does not have to give reasons, he does not have to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.064" offset="6544760">There's language of this court in the City of Richmond case, which indicates that, and the proponents placed that interpretation on it in 1975, Congress knew that’s what people thought it meant and Congress did not change the language of the section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.749" offset="6619470">I do think, to return to a point that I was addressing earlier that all kinds of questions will be raised if this sort of litigation is opened up, not just question of who can seek review, but the question of whether venue is in the District of Columbia or in local courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.163" offset="6701181">Whether 14(b) of the Act is a limit on the general venue provisions of the APA, indeed whether 14(b) requires a Three-Judge Court in an APA determination, since Three-Judge Courts are required elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.836" offset="6763875">Of course, there was not a three judge court in Harper v. Levi.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.068" offset="6776832">How soon must review be sought?</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.102" offset="6784878">There was great emphasis placed on the timeliness of the Harper V. Levi suit, in this case, but what happens if people wait a few months longer?</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.329" offset="6817792">All of these are collateral questions that I think would be an enormous waste of judicial time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.827" offset="6847781">Why not go to the remedies Congress has provided which get to the merits of these plans?</text>

            <text syncTime="1700.370" offset="6902011">If I may, I would like to address myself also to the question of special elections in 1978, and just briefly of course, we think the issue is entirely hypothetical because the District Court was correct in its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.218" offset="6961361">We would note very quickly that under the Attorney General’s guidelines were these objections ultimately to be sustained, we could go before him and ask him to withdraw it if the facts of the law have changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.333" offset="7009844">We believe that they have in this case and we would want to see that and also everyone admits that we have the right to come in to the District of Columbia court and seek the declaratory judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1762.846" offset="7151846">As I say, we do basically consider that to be hypothetical, of course, our position is that the judgment of the District Court should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1786.282" offset="7245678">Section 5 says that when that happens the state is entitled to enforce the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.629" offset="7275039">On these facts, we ask this court to hold that South Carolina may enforce its plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.177" offset="7297191">Because congress said what it meant in Section 5, and Section 5 means exactly what it says, that we can enforce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.088" offset="7364901">If the court please, I do not find it reassuring that Professor Bell says that great strides are being made under the Voting Rights Act, because great strides are not being made with respect to the South Carolina senate which remains all white, all of the Attorney General and the memorandum that Professor Bell keeps referring to that is in Appendix (a) in Red Brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1843.329" offset="7473779">In that memorandum, the Attorney General found that with proper districts it would be assumed that if there were racial voting that blacks could elect four or five members of the state senate, and maybe progress elsewhere in the country, in Georgia and in Mississippi and indeed in the South Carolina House as a result of orders of this court or objections of the Attorney General, progress has been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.871" offset="7571999">We are here to try to get progress in the state senate of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.051" offset="7588718">Much has been said about the 1975 re-enactment by Congress of the act and it must have been accepting 60 day limit and everything for which Professor Bell has been arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.811" offset="7631768">Professor Bell overlooks the language in the house that is set forth in Footnote 42 of his brief at Page 29 where Mr. Representative Edwards, expressed great approval for the Harper and Levi decision which has just been decided when Congress was re-enacting in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.447" offset="7742318">And we have to say I think that Congress in that re-enactment was thoroughly aware of Harper v. Levi and I want to refer the court also to the Senate Report number 94-95 in 94th Congress, first Session, Page 18, where a reference also was made to what was then to the reference to Harper v. Kleindienst, and Connor v. Waller.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.645" offset="7867079">So Congress in 1975, I think, was well aware of the fact that if Attorney General went completely out of the statutory scheme and abdicated his function that some result would be reached.</text>

            <text syncTime="1983.623" offset="8034994">Yes Sir, I think that the kind of determination that the Attorney General is intended to make under Section 5 is the kind of determination that the Attorney General, that would be made by the District of Columbia court if the case were presented to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.949" offset="8112316">And this court in the Thermtron case and in Dunlop v. Bachowski has made very clear that where an agency goes entirely outside of its statutory function that this court will fashion a remedy without upsetting the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.916" offset="8188176">A limited and narrow remedy and we are asking in this case only the most narrow and limited remedy which was applied in Harper v. Levi which was an order to the Attorney General not to reach a particular result but in order to perform his function and to reach a decision that was independent, and that is what he did and it was a decision that was entirely negative to the statute and he indicated that it has been his view for at least a year, that the statute was an improper statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2073.862" offset="8396006">In failing to object, he took an option. But just like the District Court in the Thermtron case which remanded a removed case on a ground that was not authorized in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.580" offset="8474791">In that same and was mandamus for that despite statutory language and history of non review of remand decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.812" offset="8507705">Just like that decision in Thermtron, the case here was that the Attorney General putting aside his own views as to validity of the statute, feeling that he was compelled, constrained, to follow a District Court judgment which was not on the Voting Rights Act which was on the Fifteenth Amendment and where the burden of proof had been on the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.309" offset="8613763">And where the District court had disclaimed, that it was passing on Section 5 recognizing that that was a function for the D.C. courts or the Attorney General. He felt constrained to follow that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.387" offset="8666008">I cannot think of a clearer case of well intentions and good faith, no doubt, but a clearer case of abdication of his clear function under Section 5 to make a judgment under the standards of the Voting Rights Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2165.818" offset="8763810">It was an error of law, Your Honor but it was an error of law of kind and degree that goes far beyond an ordinary review on the merits where factual questions are taken into account and statutory policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.221" offset="8825354">In other words anything can be called error of law but when the Attorney General says “I won’t exercise my own judgment because I can’t, and I can’t exercise my own judgment because the District Court reached a conclusion under the Fifteenth Amendment while disclaiming the Voting Rights Act”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.409" offset="8890138">Under those circumstances I say, like in the Thermtron case he has abdicated his function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.972" offset="8912394">And like Dunlop v. Bachowski, I think that this court can fashion a remedy which will not open up the chamber of horrors that have been suggested to Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.563" offset="8958788">Not open up general review, everyone coming in to attack the Attorney General, but after all the purpose of Section 5, was basically to place the burden on the covered states to demonstrate that their changes of electoral procedures were proper under the standards of the Voting Rights Act and if the Attorney General in passing on that didn’t apply the standards of the Voting Rights Act, but applied a standard of a District court on the constitution, it seems to me that it is legitimate to call that an abdication of function.</text>
