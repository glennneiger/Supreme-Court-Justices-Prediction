            <text syncTime="16.213" offset="165326">In the Scarborough case is a case here on writ of certiorari, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.213" offset="197300">The case involves the prosecution of a convicted felon for possessing firearms in violation of Title VII of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.348" offset="253933">We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Circuits regarding the statutory of required nexus between the interstate commerce and the possession of the weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.993" offset="304506">The District Court and the Court of Appeals held that the Government met its burden by proving a connection if it demonstrated that the firearm possessed by the felon had previously travelled in the interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.516" offset="362602">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we affirmed, both the tax and the legislative history of the statute evidenced a congressional intent to outlaw possession broadly and to require no more than the minimal nexus that the possessed firearms have travelled at some time in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.483" offset="450374">Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a dissenting opinion and Mr. Justice Rehnquist have no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
