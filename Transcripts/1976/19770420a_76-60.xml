            <text syncTime="149.733" offset="699348">I am David M. Kandell, First Assistant Attorney General in the State of Texas, with me this morning is Mr. Lonny. F Zweiner, an Assistant Attorney General and the Honorable Mark White, Secretary of the State, of the State of Texas whose has both, lawyer License to practice in this court and authority to this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.712" offset="791299">Despite the fact that in testifying before the House Committee considering extension of the Voting Right Bills, Mr. Stanley Pottinger who is that time Chief of the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, testified that there was no need to extend the Voting Rights Act in 1975 to the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.102" offset="888893">The act was amended and on September 18th of 1975, the Attorney General Mr. Levi and Mr. Bravesi, the Bureau of the Census issued a statement which merely recited the other requirements of the Voting Rights Act and then said that the Director of the Bureau of the Census and the Attorney General had made their determinations pursuing to Section 4(d) and 4(f)(3) of the Act and under those determinations, Texas Statewide was now, covered by the Act, published on September 18,1975 and that began the Texas?s saga with the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.689" offset="1071227">Now, some 20 months later and many thousands of submissions later, we are still submitting every change made in several thousand voting elections agencies in the State, from the State itself on down to Voter Districts to the Attorney General for his clearance.</text>

            <text syncTime="287.991" offset="1252413">Yes, Mr. Justice Brennan, our estimate in the brief is, it has been 5,000 submissions and they are going at the rate of 18 to 25 a week.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.103" offset="1300896">Out of that vast number of submissions 26 have been disapproved according to the sector wide at this late date.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.698" offset="1355230">The petitioners in this suit, petitioners in the lower Court were the Governor of the State of Texas, Dolph Briscoe and Secretary White.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.529" offset="1390548">And it was our complaint then, as it is now that the manner in which we were brought under the coverage, denied us rights, were unfair and were not consistent with the Statute or with the holdings of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.618" offset="1454914">We have basically two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.334" offset="1465781">First of all, we say that the Justice Department, the Attorney General has misconstrued and misapplied the Section 4 of the Act, in his instructions to the Bureau of the Census, that portion of the Act, that calls for the determination as to other fewer than 50% of the citizens of voting age were registered in 1972 or whether fewer than 50% of such persons voted in the Presidential election in that year, also misconstruing and misapplying Section 4(D) which advices what elements are to be considered and determining whether or not the State has used a tester device within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.656" offset="1667133">We also say that we were mistreated, if you will, in that the determinations of the Bureau of the Census and of the Attorney General, that Texas came within the factual requirements of the Statute were made arbitrarily without affording the state an opportunity to be heard without considering a very much evidence which was available at that time and by which had it been considered by the Census Bureau, the determination would have been; the Texas was not covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.397" offset="1798058">I would like to make it clear, at the outset, we do not question of the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.048" offset="1828674">We recognized that that has been determined in the South Carolina against Katzenbach, and we do not raise those issues at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.199" offset="1893248">Under the 1975 Amendments, I repeat if I may, there were two determinations to be made to bring Texas or any other state within the coverage of the Act as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.451" offset="1950300">First of all, the use -- determination by the Attorney General that in November 1972, the State or a political subdivision had used a tester device as newly defined by the Act to include voting materials in English only, and the second was that, with respect to which state or subdivision the Director of the Census found that fewer than or less than 50% of citizens of voting age were registered on November 1, 1972 or that less than 50% -- and again the magic words, such persons voted in the Presidential election of November 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.125" offset="2128977">It was interesting to hear that the Solicitor General speak about in the last argument, speak about the need to determine the questions from the face of the Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.222" offset="2173386">We sort of wish that Solicitor General?s office would accord us the same right, because it is our feeling that when one looks at the face of the Statute, with which we are concerned, there is no question but that we are correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.053" offset="2236706">The United States in making its determination as to this 4(b) requirement ignores the first language.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.788" offset="2267635">They do not even make any determination, how many voters were registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.863" offset="2283936">They say that is unimportant, because they find that fewer than 50% of the citizens of voting age voted and therefore coverage is brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.434" offset="2338166">We say that the language, such persons obviously refers to the words, citizens of voting age who registered and that it is given that interpretation without dispute, Texas does not cover.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="574.893" offset="2400024">Or it is the face of the statute does say that those determinations and certifications by the Attorney General and by the Director of Census are un-revealable at in any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.362" offset="2465957">As I understand that you are not saying that?s not constitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="596.071" offset="2484765">No Sir, and we are not asking that they be reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.846" offset="2503887">We filed this suit before they -- the determinations become effective upon publication of that, and we had -- white had made many efforts to go before them and to present to them evidence, as to the numbers without success and so before they made any determinations, before anything was published, we brought this suit, asking for injunctive relief and asking that the District Court instruct them, as to what their duty was in making these determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.572" offset="2662711">Like the Dunlop case, which I heard yesterday, as to whether or not the Secretary Of Labor could rightfully refuse to bring the suit, not review of his determination itself but the matter in which it was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.734" offset="2715374">We feel that the Courts do have jurisdiction to instruct the Census and the Attorney General?s office as to how they are to go about the process of reaching these determinations, which they do not consider determinations at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="692.937" offset="2872213">In Thermtron, for instance, where remand of a removed case is not reviewable itself but the court could held -- this court held -- they could the review the fact that the district judge refused to review before it.</text>

            <text syncTime="754.270" offset="3117555">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.467" offset="3134378">It is our contention that, Section 4(b), sub-section 4(b) of the Statute should so construed that the words, ?Such persons?, refer to persons who are citizens of voting age who had registered in November of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.739" offset="3219433">It is un-controverted that the Census Bureau made no such determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.579" offset="3246809">They completely ignored the earlier language of the section that they were to find whether fewer than 50% of the citizens of voting age were registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.318" offset="3289755">They paid no attention to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.752" offset="3299472">It is also un-controverted that using Justice Department figures, there were 7,600,000 and some odd thousands citizens of voting age and according to our figures 5,200,000 citizens of the State were registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.612" offset="3366868">That being so, way more than 50% of the citizens of voting age were registered and of such persons, those 5,200,000, I think, it is some 3,600,000 that voted in 1972 election which again is well over 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.455" offset="3454326">Under our interpretation, more than 50% were registered and more than 50% of ?such persons? voted in 1972 and Texas is not covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.081" offset="3504795">The language of the statute is clear and non ambiguous, and that was as much admitted in the Court of Appeals where Judge Makinen(ph) said at the outside, appellants would seem to have the better argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.398" offset="3570101">It is a rule of statutory construction that the legislative enactments be so construed as to give effect to all parts and as a matter of fact, the United States in its brief at Page 37 says, ?Whatever force this contention referring to our contention might have as a purely textual argument?, and I do not find it shocking that we would insist that the text of the Statute be followed, that is what we ask.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.853" offset="7211884">I would like to just describe the Voting Rights Act amendments of 1975, as they are relevant to this case, then discuss the statutory preclusion of review of the coverage determinations that is contained in Section 4(b) of the Statute, as it effects the District Court?s jurisdiction, and then address the merits of the contentions, Texas has advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.994" offset="7316478">The Statute appears in the brief in opposition filed by the respondents at Appendix 1 (a) through 6 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.954" offset="7384292">There are one or two provisions which we have not set forth, which I will mention briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.733" offset="7407384">One preliminary word, the Statute was adopted with Texas, specifically in mind and so far as the minority language group guarantee is concerned, both the Senate and the House reports describe this in detail, as did the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.791" offset="7503619">Now, the 1975 amendments contained a number of titles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1856.182" offset="7525144">In Title 2 of the amendments, Congress made express findings in Section 4(f)(1) that is on Page 4(a) that voting discrimination against citizens of certain enumerated language minorities was pervasive and national in scope and that to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments, it was necessary to eliminate that discrimination by prohibiting English only elections as to those people and by adopting other remedial devices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1888.849" offset="7655861">The term language minority was in turn defined in Section 14(c)(3) of the Act which we have not printed, to mean persons belonging to American-Indian, Native Alaskan, Asian-American or Spanish Heritage groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.234" offset="7745408">The devices under Title II that Congress adopted, included extension of the existing Voting Rights Act prohibitions against the use of ?tests and devices? as a pre-requisite for voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.570" offset="7806744">A requirement for pre-clearance under Section 5 of changes in the coverage jurisdictions election laws and there were necessary assignment of federal examiners to register voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.747" offset="7855436">Now, let me distinguish Title II from Title III, because there is some material in the record that refers to Title III.</text>
            <text syncTime="1944.376" offset="7878006">In Title III of the amendments, Congress also adopted some separate remedies for jurisdictions, in which minority language voters were disadvantaged because of educational deficiencies, but there did not seem to be evidence of intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.619" offset="7934953">Jurisdictions covered by this provision, must also cover conduct elections only in English, but the special remedies, such as Section 5 or voting examiners are not applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.842" offset="7975808">Now we are not concerned with Title III, in this case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.553" offset="7998692">In this case, we are concerned really only with members of the Spanish Heritage category of language minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.142" offset="8033069">In Section 4(f)(2) of the Act, Congress prohibited denial or abridgement of the right to vote because a person is a member of the enumerated language minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.631" offset="8078940">It added a third sentence to the existing triggering provisions, providing that the prohibition against the use of tests and devices, contained in the act would apply in state and political subdivisions as to which the Attorney General determined maintained on November 1, 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.519" offset="8162532">Any ?test or device? as defined in the act and with respect to which the Director of the Census determined that less than 50% of the citizens of voting age who were registered or less than 50% voted in the Presidential election of November 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.151" offset="8225121">Now, this was a change in the coverage formula, the previous coverage formula, in the 1965 Act and the 1970 Act had referred to persons of voting age, because Congress was addressing the problem of language minority, for the first time, it focused on citizens voting only, and it adopted a change in the third sentence, specifying that only citizens could vote, that is how the alienage problem got into our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.864" offset="8331910">The term ?test or device? had been defined under the old act as meaning prerequisites for voting, requiring demonstration of literacy or education achievement or knowledge, good moral character or proof of qualifications by some sort of vouchering.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.264" offset="8397529">In Section 4(f)(3), Congress amended the definition of ?test or device? to add a new concept which is what we are dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.407" offset="8434101">It referred to provision of voting materials ?only in English language? where the Director of the Census determines that more than 5% of the citizens of voting age residing in the state or political subdivision are members of a single language minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.094" offset="8500870">Now, the 1965 Act as amended, makes no provision in these triggering sections for hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.511" offset="8542561">It also bars review of a determination by the Attorney General or Director of the Census with respect to the triggering provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2358.543" offset="9534587">Returning then to the structure of the Statute, I have just mentioned that under Section 4(a) there can be a bailout suit with respect to a determination of the use of a ?test or device? for the discriminatory purpose or effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.551" offset="9602715">This is the only time that such an inquiry has made with respect to the definition of ?test or device? there is nothing in Section 4(c) defining the original ?test or device?, nothing in Section 4(f)(3), defining the new language ?test or device? authorizes an inquiry into whether or not the ?test or device? has a purpose or effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.134" offset="9689023">So that, when you go back to the triggering provision and look at what the Attorney General has to determine, you will see that on Page 4(a), all that he determines, is whether the jurisdiction maintained on November 1, 1975, any ?test or device?.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.045" offset="9748687">There is no statutory authorization for the triggering determination to inquire into whether it was used with a discriminatory purpose or effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="2428.579" offset="9814829">Now, I would like to talk about the jurisdiction, because section 4(b) bars review in any Court of a determination and certification, of the Attorney General and the Director of the Census, under Section 4 and certain other enumerated sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.660" offset="9867074">First, let me say that the Attorney General now agrees with the Court Of Appeals construction of Section 4(b) in which the Court Of Appeals held that there was a very, very limited ground for inquiry under the Statute and that this suit is permitted because of that very limited inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.055" offset="9952651">Let me say the outset, that in Gaston County against United States under the old Act in 395 US, the Court stated at Page 291 that the coverage formula chosen by Congress was designed to be speedy objective and incontrovertible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.813" offset="10023704">As we read section 4(b), the only matter that can be opened to record, opened to review on this record is whether the Attorney General or the Director of the Bureau of the Census applied some coverage formula other than the formula chosen by Congress, and that is all that can be reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.920" offset="10104161">In the face of an expressed preclusion of judicial review worded like section 4(b), only inquiry that is available on this record is whether the defendants exceeded their statutory authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3250.828" offset="13103750">In so far as Texas? arguing that is a matter of law, the Director of the Census erred in relying upon Census data, now he had to determine how many citizens there were.</text>

            <text syncTime="3298.545" offset="13294653">It is raising an issue of law as to the meaning of the statute, we think that that much is reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.815" offset="13323701">We also think its contentions are defeated by the plain legislative history because Attorney General John Katzenbach got up and actually said the words, ?such persons? in this statute means persons who actually voted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.188" offset="13377199">The statute has been reenacted, it is been construed that way consistently.</text>

            <text syncTime="3330.900" offset="13424115">The issues, the triggering determinations here involved with the Court called in South Carolina against Katzenbach, objective statistical determinations by the Census Bureau in a routine analysis of state statutes by the department of justice.</text>
