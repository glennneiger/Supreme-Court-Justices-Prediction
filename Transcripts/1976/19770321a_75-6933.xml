            <text syncTime="62.399" offset="350045">The facts in this case are the petitioner Nathaniel Brown was arrested and in addition to being charged of certain traffic offenses, a complaint that were filed against him charged that he did unlawfully and purposely take drive for operate a certain motor vehicle without the consent of the owner of that motor vehicle.</text>

            <text syncTime="100.516" offset="502495">The complaint that was filed against him in the first charge listed the name of the owner of the automobile and it listed her address.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.360" offset="549934">Two days later, petitioner answered that charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.743" offset="567488">He waived counsel, he waived trial by jury and without any plea negotiations being entered into, he pled guilty to all of the charges that were lodged against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.899" offset="608030">He was sentenced to 30 days in the workhouse fined $100 in Court cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.546" offset="630704">30 days later as petitioner was leaving the workhouse, waiting for him at the gates of the workhouse were police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.098" offset="656827">These are officers arrested petitioner and charged him with stealing the same motor vehicle that had been the subject to the first charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.246" offset="697473">This time this complaint that was filed against him though, alleged the date of the offense to be ten days prior to the date that was alleged in the first complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.889" offset="748046">After certain procedural matters, petitioner conditionally pled guilty to the charge, but he expressed understanding that a subsequent motion to withdraw the plaintiff’s misindictment on the grounds of Double Jeopardy could be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.962" offset="804366">The State agreed to this procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.527" offset="814606">The motion was filed, hearing was had and motion was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.756" offset="827459">Petitioner then was sentenced to six months in the county jail; sentence was suspended and placed on one year probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.218" offset="857343">Petitioner appealed his conviction to the Ohio Court of Appeals, Eighth Appellate District.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.711" offset="879285">That Court affirmed to conviction holding that the two charges were the same offense within the meaning of Double Jeopardy Clause applying this Court’s test in Blockburger and it says they were the same offense, however because different dates were alleged and the complaints supposedly different crimes were committed.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.320" offset="1029751">They could constitutionally charge a person there with multiple counts, if they provided to give the person adequate notice of this offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.140" offset="1060993">I would cite examples of those types of crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.776" offset="1079592">They are more not really crimes of common law that emitting noxious odors each day…</text>

            <text syncTime="260.570" offset="1142704">Those statutes give the accuse adequate notice that each day he does it he is going to get nailed for his misdeeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.203" offset="1173320">Also in those instances, there are valid interests that the State has been protecting an individual -- protecting society from that type of offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.051" offset="1212712">Now, admittedly I am sure Gloria Ingram did not feel any better by having her car -- Gloria Ingram was a victim by having a car and missing ten days as opposed to only a few hours.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.363" offset="1369970">Well, in a theft case, I was going to getting into that later.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.205" offset="1385330">In a theft case, such as this just because it was alleged different dates in the complaint, does not make it two different crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.557" offset="1414691">They could conceivably under the Ohio Court of Appeals’ opinion have alleged file ten complaints against him alleging different dates and it would have been just arbitrariness on top of it and I would think this Court’s opinion in In re Snow.</text>

            <text syncTime="600.702" offset="2503266">The reason was that in the two trial Courts, we had really two trial Courts even in this same one.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.424" offset="2526149">The east Cleveland Municipal Court and the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court both of those judges were concerning whether or not they are lesser included offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.156" offset="2557078">As far as they were concerned, if they were lesser included offenses, the indictment had to be dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.495" offset="2574423">All the papers and motions and arguments in the trial Courts were focused on whether they were lesser included offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.719" offset="2599396">It made no difference about the dates and the complaints.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.092" offset="2608801">We took the case up to the Ohio Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.389" offset="2622071">You are looking at the brief in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.405" offset="2634087">All the arguments were addressed to lesser included offenses and that is why the Ohio Court of Appeal spent so much time in their decision stating that it was a lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.435" offset="2674211">Then all of a sudden, they came out with this decision that it was because of the dates in offend.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.202" offset="2693228">I then filed a motion to reconsideration, timely filed in that case, which I am allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.672" offset="2711201">I filed a timely motioned the reconsideration stating as a continuous offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.566" offset="2726770">That is why we have a different issue here today and we do not have the issue of lesser included offense because the Ohio Court of Appeals explicitly held that it was a lesser included offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="762.066" offset="3148699">Now, that statute under which he was convicted, prohibits taking, operating or keeping a car without the owner’s consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.252" offset="3185480">The complaint filed against him charged taking, driving or operating now apparently the person who drew the complain copy the wrong form because the statute had been amended in March of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.117" offset="3220902">But anyway it has never been alleged, it is nothing but the statute in effect at the time of arrest that he was charged with.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.702" offset="3243263">And that statute covers all types of means and methods in which one person can deprive another person of dominion control and possession of the property.</text>
