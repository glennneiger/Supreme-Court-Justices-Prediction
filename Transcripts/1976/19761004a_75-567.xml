            <label>Mr. Robert Mix</label>
            <text syncTime="49.562" offset="298770">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.050" offset="312667">Gentlemen, I am Robert Mix appearing here on behalf of Corvallis Sand &amp; Gravel Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.128" offset="345059">The issues in the case are essentially the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.581" offset="362822">Those made by the State are: Was the change in channel of the Willamette River from a loop approximately three miles in length to a basically straight channel across the neck of the loop avulsive.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.066" offset="432726">In that connection, it should be pointed out that the land involved in this case is not only the changed channel but a portion of the river as it had historically flowed in its natural pit.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.024" offset="492599">The other issue made by the State is whether or not the change of channel transferred private dry land to the State is fee simple, by virtue of the presence of the water, which had submerged the private land.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.507" offset="562502">The issues made by Corvallis Sand are the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.354" offset="581937">Does the State has sufficient title to maintain ejectment, to recover the bed of the river when its title is based on sovereignty and when there is no issue in the case as to interference with the public right of navigation and fishery by Corvallis Sand?</text>
            <text syncTime="143.684" offset="675247">In this connection, the Sand &amp; Gravel materials that were removed from the river, were removed under permits issued by the Core of Engineers.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.928" offset="720177">The second issue made by Corvallis Sand, does the State by virtue of its sovereignty has sufficient title to recover money damages for removal by Corvallis Sand of Sand and gravel materials from the bed of the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.307" offset="797709">Again, there being no issue as to interference with navigation or fishery by Corvallis Sand.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.481" offset="838460">In support of its position --</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="186.276" offset="845565">Mr. Mix, isn’t one of the underlying issues in the case at least if you take some of the amicus briefs that a question of what law governs on this issue of title whether it is Oregon law or Federal Common law?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_mix" startTime="200.741" stopTime="228.772">
            <label>Mr. Robert Mix</label>
            <text syncTime="200.741" offset="903453">Yes, Your Honor, it is my understanding of the Bonelli decision that we are now in an area to be controlled by Federal Common Law and that decision is at the core of the courts receiving this case, and the Court is expelled out as a matter of Common Law the extent of the State’s title.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="228.772" offset="1015570">Well, of course, Bonelli is distinguished below its fact, isn’t it?</text>
            <text syncTime="232.526" offset="1030617">There you were dealing with what had been an interstate boundary and the Court in its original jurisdiction cases had always treated that as a matter of Federal Common Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.187" offset="1069278">But, the Willamette River at Corvallis has never been an interstate boundary.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_mix" startTime="246.671" stopTime="356.909">
            <label>Mr. Robert Mix</label>
            <text syncTime="246.671" offset="1087146">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.778" offset="1091639">As to the Willamette River, it is my understanding of Bonelli that the Court said that first the State’s title to the bed is a limited title, that the State’s interest in the bed must be related to navigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.882" offset="1171991">Third, that that title is determinable if the navigable aspect of the use of the bed ceases.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.683" offset="1207204">Fourthly, that the State’s interest in the bed is “as a bed”, and in that connection, the court sighted that the case of State v. Gill from Alabama, in which the Alabama court held that the State holds title to the bed “as a bed” and not to the individual grains of sand or lumps of mud.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.952" offset="1320262">The first basis on which Corvallis Sand claims that the State cannot maintain the ejectment, is that the Common Law concept of the ownership of the beds of navigable fresh water streams controls in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.325" offset="1381807">That doctrine was announced by this Court in the case of Jones v. Soulard, decided in 1860.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.055" offset="1412736">Oregon was admitted to the Union in 1859, and it is submitted that as of the time Oregon became a State, the Common Law controlled the ownership of the beds of navigable streams and under the Common Law, the State interest did not extend above tide water.</text>

            <text syncTime="356.909" offset="1528093">How is the basis of the Federal Court jurisdiction in Jones v. Soulard do you remember?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Mix</label>
            <text syncTime="363.453" offset="1554320">Your Honor, it is not made clear in the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.782" offset="1571665">As to jurisdiction, we take the position there is jurisdiction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.333" offset="1605833">All the property that has been involved in this case originally was patented out by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.470" offset="1638329">Secondly, on the basis of the equal-footing doctrine, which was a basis for jurisdiction also as I understand it in the Bonelli case.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.157" offset="1681170">Also on the basis of the fact that the Willamette River is navigable, and I hope to talk about that later at least until the Bonelli decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.699" offset="1731325">Also on the basis that the Oregon Courts ruling, which in effect said that the State has a fee simple title to the bed is contrary to Bonelli.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="420.561" offset="1782734">If your first basis for jurisdiction were federal jurisdiction, the idea that the land was originally patented by the Federal Government were adequate to sustain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.115" offset="1828919">Any real property dispute that a role is west of the Appellation Mountains you could bring in Federal Court, could you not?</text>

            <text syncTime="438.838" offset="1855877">Yes, Your Honor, and the Court has stated this as a basis for jurisdiction.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Mix</label>
            <text syncTime="444.687" offset="1879283">In Hughes v. Washington and also in Borax Limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.688" offset="1895270">And also as I -- well, not in Bonelli.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.282" offset="1905614">No I do not think the federal aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.241" offset="1913451">The federal patent aspect is mentioned in Bonelli.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.768" offset="1927557">Now, Your Honor, my recollection maybe in errand -- apparently, it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.123" offset="1945007">It was not my understanding that Bonelli involved a boundary between two states.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.150" offset="1981056">Another basis for jurisdiction is the problem of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.677" offset="2007178">This again, I hope to discuss later, but it is on the basis that the riparians became vested with certain rights that they were granted under the Common Law and that those rights have been divested and particularly in this situation, and it should be pointed out that the states -- at least I have not questioned jurisdiction in previous cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.808" offset="2115743">Continuing with the basis of Corvallis or the Common Law as being controlling here, under the Common Law, the State had no interest in the beds of navigable fresh water streams.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.606" offset="2162973">Again, Oregon became a State in 1859 and the Common Law was controlling, in my view, until at least 1876.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.183" offset="2201216">When the court gave the opinion in Barney v. Keokuk, the patents involved in this case are dated approximately 1853, 1859, 1865, and one of them involving one small government lot is dated 1883.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.375" offset="2281986">However, that was a homestead, not a donation land claim and the entryman had made his entry in his filing in 1875.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.885" offset="2328066">We took the position in the Oregon Courts that his riparian rights related back to 1875, which would be before Barney v. Keokuk.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.915" offset="2364115">The Oregon Court rejected that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.326" offset="2381774">The Oregon Court did not, to the best of my knowledge until 1908, in the case of Hume v. Rogue River Packing Company make a ruling that the beds of navigable fresh water streams belong to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.396" offset="2442065">And, by that time, all of these rights had been vested.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.833" offset="2455857">The Oregon Legislature did not until 1967 pass a statute claiming that the State owned the beds of navigable fresh water rivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.394" offset="2494101">Now the second and alternative ground for ownership by Corvallis Sand is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.670" offset="2523149">Accepting the line of decisions of the court which began with Barney v. Keokuk in 1876 that the State owns the bed of navigable fresh water streams, but that the State has the right to grant to the riparian, whatever portion of that title it wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.190" offset="2597232">In applying that line of decisions, it is our position that in 1859, when Oregon became a State by constitutional provision yet adopted the Common Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.623" offset="2646969">This was accomplished by continuing enforce of the statutes of the territory and, one of those statutes made the Common Law controlling in Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.411" offset="2682182">Then it is our position that in 1859 Oregon, even though it owned the beds of the navigable fresh water streams, made an election to apply the Common Law and that the riparian received his traditional rights and that it is a denial of due process to now try to take those rights away from him.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="666.060" offset="2764729">Would you analogize that situation to a case where Oregon had received lands from the Federal Government at the time of Statehood, which were unrestricted (Inaudible) and turned around and conveyed them to private individuals?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_mix" startTime="679.280" stopTime="768.097">
            <label>Mr. Robert Mix</label>
            <text syncTime="679.280" offset="2817601">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.117" offset="2825020">In that situation, I assume we are talking about lieu lands, and in that situation, the State of Oregon would be in the position of a private land owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.835" offset="2871831">When it granted, if it gave land that was riparian, and did not reserve any rights from the deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.785" offset="2899626">The entire title would pass including the traditional Common Law of riparian rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.393" offset="2934107">The third basis for the position that the State cannot maintain the ejectment is based on Bonelli, which approaches in many ways, at least in my view, the Common Law and again, Bonelli held the State’s title is limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.905" offset="3032119">It must be related to navigation, it is determinable, the State’s interest in the bed is as a bed and my interpretation of that is that as part of the navigational servitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.083" offset="3100873">The public would have the right to anchor on the bed as part of the fishing servitude for example, it would have the right to way down the bed, to have used the bed for spawning salmon and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.410" offset="3150192">But, that it is not proprietary.</text>

            <text syncTime="768.097" offset="3172866">did I ot understand you say that at no time as Sand &amp; Gravel Company every interfered or conducted activities that would interfere with these various rights?</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert Mix</label>
            <text syncTime="782.040" offset="3228664">Yes, Your Honor, and my basis for saying them is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.989" offset="3248413">The Core of Engineers, under the commerce clause issued permits for removal of Sand &amp; Gravel materials and it is our position those permits would not be if -- that the court would not issue those permits if navigation were being interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.942" offset="3344230">And the second basis is that the State at no time pleaded or offered any evidence that there was any interference with navigation or fishery, throughout the case we have maintained there was no interference, and to the best of my knowledge a State has never said there was any interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.139" offset="3433046">The fourth ground relates solely to the judgment for money damages recovered by the State and the State recovered a judgment based on the number of cubic yards of material removed from the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.663" offset="3503159">At Common Law the riparian had the right to remove Sand &amp; Gravel so long as he did not interfere with the public rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.371" offset="3549970">Bonelli, holds again, the State owns the bed as a bed citing State v. Gill, and then Gill, the Alabama Court said, “The title to the State does not extend to the individual grains of sand or lumps of mud”.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.770" offset="3623531">And on that basis, we submit that the proprietary right of removing Sand &amp; Gravel is not owned by the State, but belongs to the riparian and the State cannot recover damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="902.060" offset="3708690">Yes, Your Honor, and as a matter of river hydraulics, the river normally replaces the Sand &amp; Gravel you remove it in the next spring or in the next high water, it washes more material though.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.238" offset="3765428">There is a related matter, it is not an issue directly but it is important and that is the definition of navigable or navigability.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.105" offset="3820912">There is no question, but that in 1971 when this case was tried, that the definition of navigable applied to any stream which had historically been navigated irrespective of subsequent events.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.601" offset="3898862">The Willamette River was used in the early days as the main artery of commerce in the Willamette River, and again, I am referring to the area above Corvallis, which is the disputed part.</text>

            <text syncTime="972.543" offset="3990708">Today the stream is used, fishermen floating down or people floating down canoes and inner tubes and such.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.408" offset="4022160">The historical definitions of navigable are derived from two sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.681" offset="4051208">First, in the Genesee Chief in 1851, the court for purposes of admiralty jurisdiction held that admiralty jurisdiction does extend to navigable fresh water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.245" offset="4125500">In 1870, in the case of Daniel Ball, the Court held it for purposes of the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.314" offset="4165729">Navigable is to be defined as far as fresh water is concerned, as all streams or bodies, which are capably of being used commercially for trade and travel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1373.048" offset="5592641">And I submit that this is a very critical question to the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="1392.921" offset="5672158">Hughes v. Washington, Your Honor I submit, relied upon a construction of a federal patent and it is a question there, it involved the federal patent and the boundary that we were talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.645" offset="5719074">We are talking about actually defining one of the boundaries of a federal patent where you have a federal patent and the construction of that patent and its scope and giving a force and effect such as in use or in Borax question, we concede that there is a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.755" offset="5779573">However, the normal rule is under Joy v. City of St. Louis, which is mentioned in one of the Amici briefs, is that the mere fact that a federal patent was the source of title does not conferred jurisdiction on any court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.015" offset="5836520">There has to be an issue about construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.783" offset="5847596">In this case there was no issue of construction of the patent; the issue here is the effect of a change brought about by a flood on the Willamette River.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.426" offset="5882182">We submit that, that is a question purely and simply of State Law, what the effect of that change was?</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.027" offset="5908618">Now, effectively what we are arguing for is with regard, we submit it first under the equal-footing doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.189" offset="5933278">The equal-footing doctrine is properly interpreted, leaves to the State courts the right to determine under their own rules of property and in their own forum, all questions with regard to the beds of navigable rivers and all questions with regard to the changes in those beds that occurred later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.463" offset="6014362">Simply stated that means that all these questions are State Law questions as we see them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.096" offset="6036932">An alternative view, we believe essentially that, that construction is the proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.033" offset="6060651">An alternative, and perhaps equally acceptable construction to the states that argue is Amici, is about if the equal-footing doctrine does confer jurisdiction under the Federal Constitution on this Court, it confers it to define what the incidence of sovereignty are and no more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.097" offset="6136929">It does not confer a basis for determining questions under Federal Common Law, and to explain that point and what I mean by that is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.831" offset="6175799">The Court could say that as of the date of admission to the Union, the states involved by under the equal-footing doctrine were vested with the fee simple title in the beds of all navigable rivers as to wherever those beds might move in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.271" offset="6261585">However, relying on the analysis of Bonelli, the effect of that decision would be that it would quite title to the beds of navigable rivers in all States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.838" offset="6307874">In the State, in full proprietary and all other sovereign aspects and would do so as a matter constitutional law no longer bringing cases like this before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.058" offset="6360746">Because any effect of where the river happened to be flowing and change by a flood would live those cases out of Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.957" offset="6388331">However, if Bonelli is applied under those circumstances it would mean; State cannot rely upon the equal-footing doctrine as a source of title for relicted beds or reemerged land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.537" offset="6442666">But we submit that still does not present a federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.009" offset="6456563">What it creates is a title vacuum, and that is really what the issue was in Bonelli.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.355" offset="6477879">In other words, the Court as we see it should have gone no further than to decide in Bonelli that equal-footing did not confer title on the State?</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.501" offset="6518525">It should not then have gone and created a Federal Common Law rule, which disposed of the relicted bed of the river and granted it to Bonelli Cattle Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.911" offset="6568158">Because the question there presented is really a question of State Law as the cases of this Court indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.475" offset="6594385">The effects of accretion, the effects of avulsion, the effects of reliction, all of those questions have always been held by this Court to be questions for the State courts, not questions for the federal courts to determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.373" offset="6653944">And we submit that the basis for this second alternative is essentially that when you decide that equal-footing determines that there was no claim in Bonelli.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.043" offset="6720713">That equal-footing could be a basis for the State’s title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.585" offset="6746835">Really it should be up to the State Court to decide the disposition of the property in question at that point, because the third section of the Bonelli opinion begins by stating the question that remains is asked to who owns the subject land under the applicable Federal Common Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.795" offset="6827711">I submit however, that the parties in Bonelli, and having read the briefs, I submit this, indicated that there was no difference between State and Federal Law in this case and they did not bring out any source of federal jurisdiction for creating a Federal Common Law or principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.160" offset="6893121">We are told in Erie Railroad v. Tompkins that there is no longer any general Federal Common Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.399" offset="6922065">So we must look to one of the several sources of specialized common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.943" offset="6944321">None of them, which our brief points out are applicable in the case of the Federal Common Law rules created in the Bonelli decision and I think --</text>

            <text syncTime="1967.404" offset="7970097">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.562" offset="7986711">My name is Peter Herman, I represent the Attorney General’s office, State of Oregon and I am here on behalf of the State Land Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.079" offset="8028821">I feel some clarifying statements here on order in terms of stating the case, I would like to call the Court’s attention to pages 40 and 41 of the joint appendix, the brown document.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.887" offset="8092037">The chart on the left shows the river as it was in 1890, and the Court will note two points A and B.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.983" offset="8136445">This is the neck of the Peninsula, and the overflow channel that was discovered on that date.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.300" offset="8169673">The photograph or the channel on the right, page 41 it shows an enlarged overflow channel and the smaller channel going around the Oxbow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.460" offset="8210320">That was a river as an existed in 1911 after the change took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.917" offset="8256191">Now, the holding of the Bonelli Cattle Company, as we interpreted the decision, was that public title follows the river and its change is to guarantee full public use and enjoyment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.438" offset="8326303">That when the river recedes from riparian property, the exposed land is no longer needed by the State for public purpose, and therefore title goes to the riparian owner, and whether the change is sudden or artificial, acceptable or not, makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.937" offset="8400282">We submit that the rationale should be applied in this case to the fact involving Fischer Cut and in any event, even if traditional avulsion doctrine is to be applied, we submit as a matter of law that no avulsion did in fact occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.714" offset="8479381">And in effect what the court is being called upon to do here is to review the legal conclusions the Oregon courts drew and then essentially agreed upon factual setting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2148.214" offset="8693376">That is the overflow channel that the Court sees on page 40 and the enlarged channel that the Court sees on page 41 with the word ‘Fischer’ in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.775" offset="8731619">Over a 20-year period, there is much flooding, recurrent storms, some major storms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.369" offset="8765996">In 1890 this channel current water and in the intermediate stage of five feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.394" offset="8790029">By 1906, one-fourth of the river was flowing through this channel at the four-foot stage, which is again an intermediate stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.558" offset="8834751">There were some more major storms, and by November -- sometime after November 25 of 1909, the main flow of the river was found coursing through this overflow channel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.486" offset="8882398">Now, the Trial Court held that this constitute an avulsion that the change was sudden and violent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.383" offset="8909983">The Oregon Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court essentially agreed, and ruled that the State had no title to the bed in this portion of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.059" offset="8956690">Now this section of the river is approximately 2,500 feet long, but the Court sent the case back to the Trial Court to determine the precise limits of the avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.515" offset="9002561">Now the issue we raised in our petition is whether under these facts, it was proper for the Court to conclude that an avulsion did occur, and that the public did not have a title in this bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.871" offset="9055955">Stated in other way, we are contending that this was not an avulsion that the public’s title to the river followed the river as it enlarged over the years this overflow channel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3208.895" offset="12936080">Clearing up one basis fact matter, the land in dispute can be divided into two types.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.929" offset="12976204">A comparably small portion of it was under the channel that is being disputed as to whether or not it was revolted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.838" offset="13007864">The balance of it, upstream was in the original bed of the river and I submit this creates two different problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.464" offset="13058333">My concern here is apply to the riparian.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.626" offset="13082992">Being very candid, if the Court had not starting with Barney v. Keokuk, handed down a line of decisions under federal authority taking the ownership of the bed from the riparian and giving it to the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3268.126" offset="13172958">We would not be here today, because all States except Louisiana adopted the Common Law, and there was no question as to what the Common Law meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.930" offset="13224262">It was only when the Court said the States own the beds but they may decide what disposition are going make of them, that we found ourselves in the situation we are in today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.409" offset="13278179">On that basis, Bonelli becomes very important because it points the way to a return to what was the law of the land and it should be pointed out that in 1876 when Barney was decided, 38 states had already been admitted to the Union and in the territories not yet granted Statehood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.867" offset="13391969">It is safe to assume that the principle riparian land had been occupied.</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.463" offset="13534388">Again, by 1876 most of the important riparian land in this country was occupied by riparians; and then Barney v. Keokuk was handed down and the riparian started to have his rights taken away from him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.309" offset="13613696">And again, emphasizing the due process aspect, there is even more than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.140" offset="13641072">There is the problem of the Court taking jurisdiction a hundred years ago and if it is now are going to be declared that the Court does not have jurisdiction, the riparian is left at the mercy of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.708" offset="13703348">And there is a very practical aspect of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.851" offset="13727903">Stating this hypothetically, but it is very real.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.813" offset="13739711">We take a riparian in State A, and State A Supreme Court has decided as Oregon has and as Mr. Herman says that the riparian has no right to below high water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.573" offset="13794777">Immediately across this navigable river is State B, and State B is ruled that the riparian owns the middle of the stream.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.983" offset="13828422">They are both under the Common Law; they are both under applicable constitutions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.688" offset="13851201">How in that situation do we explain to A the State can actually come in and take the portion of the bed in front of your river or of your property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.785" offset="13891639">Sell it off so as long as it does not interfere with navigation and let us take between high and low of the water for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.071" offset="13912746">Someone can sell it in, build a building and you A have no rights left.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.770" offset="13939600">Now there at least, while Bonelli is in dispute here, there is certainly one thing said in Bonelli that should not in my judgment be in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.857" offset="13983903">And that is that riparian thus is important, and there is no reason under our jurisprudence pursuing to a riparian, you do not occupy the same status as other property owners in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.583" offset="14050881">There is no reason to discriminate against the riparian when the courts are dedicated to protecting the property rights in other types of situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.279" offset="14105634">The common law as it applied until at least 1876 would resolve all of these problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="3559.425" offset="14338228">We are the owners by mean conveyances of the property, which was originally patented out by the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.203" offset="14369262">And it is our position that when that property was received from the Federal Government as part of it the riparian rights passed, and that we have succeeded to those rights by the mean conveyances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3583.319" offset="14433732">And that this a matter of Federal Law in interpreting that patent that the State cannot come along and say, “Now even though you have a federal patent, you have got nothing beyond the high water mark”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.702" offset="14507293">Again, very briefly, the Common Law if it is applied we will not have these problems of avulsion, what is navigable, it is a very simple matter to determine the head of tide water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.746" offset="14559537">Turning briefly to the State the matters of the State has raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3621.487" offset="14586496">The law goes back to the Romans, that if a river changes its channel and flows over private property, the private land owner does not lose his title.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.979" offset="14632367">We are not talking about riparian rights, we are talking about the law of submergence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.221" offset="14657340">And the riparian continues to maintain title subject to the public navigational servitude and disagreeing with California’s position, the State does not need fee title to the bed to protect the public and we know this is true, because approximately 20 states within this country the State has declared or has adopted the Common Law and the riparian owns the bed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3667.317" offset="14769771">And there is no record to my knowledge of the riparian successfully interfering with the public rights.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3673.913" offset="14796102">And the Oregon courts decided likewise in this case, with respect to the avulsive channel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3685.063" offset="14840720">And this is an illustration of the lack of need of fee title in the State and what we are disputing here really is proprietary rights of the riparian on the one hand versus the right of the public to use the water on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3699.503" offset="14898502">And there is no real conflict except that one is created hypothetically by saying, well, we hold it in trust but I submit that is a misapplication of the trust doctrine.</text>
