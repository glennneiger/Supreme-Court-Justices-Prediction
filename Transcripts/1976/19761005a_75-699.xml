            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="12.903" offset="152039">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.724" offset="163324">This case is here on appeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.319" offset="185790">The issue concerns the imposition of a support test on widowers, but not widows as a condition on eligibility for Social Cecurity survivors’ benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.890" offset="224033">The appellee is a retired federal employee and a widower.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.784" offset="243573">Following the death of his wife he applied for Social Security widower’s benefits, under his deceased wife’s earnings account.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.578" offset="278786">That is he sought to tack Social Security retirements benefits, Social Security survivors’ benefits on to his existing civil service pension.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.757" offset="319537">If appellee had been a private employee rather than a civil servant, he would not have been able to tack benefits in this way even without regards of the support test he challenges here.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.407" offset="362064">Reason for this is that both widows and widowers to be eligible for survivors’ benefits must pass what may for convenience be called the PIA test.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.454" offset="410338">PIA refers to the Primary Insurance Amount, which is the maximum monthly old age benefit to which a veteran is entitled under his or her own earnings account.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.733" offset="459448">Only a survivor whose PIA is less than that of the deceased spouse is entitled to a survivors’ benefits and it is undisputed that if appellee’s lifetime earnings have been covered by Social Security, he could not have passed this test.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.507" offset="518485">The PIA test bars a widower from tacking a smaller survivors’ benefit on to an existing Social Security old age benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.415" offset="550146">The theory behind this rule is that Social Security benefits are not vested rights, but are payable on the basis of probable need.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.646" offset="583060">If a widower is already receiving old age benefits in access of the survivors’ benefits to which he would otherwise be entitled, he probably is not needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.067" offset="624751">But the PIA test standing alone is insufficient, inadequate to weed out non-needy federal pensioners, such as appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.599" offset="666861">It is inadequate to weed out this category of non-needy widowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.763" offset="691520">To achieve this end of weeding out such widowers, Congress has imposed a second test, the support test that is at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.873" offset="727987">Under this test a widower must prove that he was receiving more than one half of his support from his wife at the time of her death, disability or retirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.866" offset="771977">The practical effect of the support test is suggested in the Appendix to our Brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.375" offset="794025">In short, if the support test were eliminated, approximately $447 million annually would be required to be distributed to non-needy widowers and out of this from $300 million to $350 million would be required to be distributed to non-needy pensioners such as appellee.</text>

            <text syncTime="208.096" offset="932892">The problem in this case is that the support test does not apply to women.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.739" offset="951386">A widow age 60 year older who passes the PIA test is entitled to survivors’ benefits without regard to support.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.650" offset="983047">Thats is a woman, similarly situated to appellee that is a retired female civil servant whose husband’s lifetime employment had been covered by Social Security, would be entitled to survivors’ benefits and this loophole in the Social Security law does not appear ever to have received explicit congressional attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.035" offset="1060578">And it is upon the existence of this loophole that creates different treatment for this small narrow class of men and women upon which appellee’s case largely depends.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="250.095" offset="1100807">Mr. Jones I am also a little rusty on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.305" offset="1109688">This $440 million figure which applies to the small narrow class, is that based anything on the record or is that something you have developed subsequently just in the briefs here?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="263.526" stopTime="458.064">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="263.526" offset="1154619">It is not in the record Mr. Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.146" offset="1165068">The methodology underlying the estimate is spelled out in the Appendix to our Brief on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.469" offset="1210312">The amount involved was not for an issue in the District Courts as far as I understanded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.647" offset="1235076">The appellee could not pass the support test, he had not in fact been dependent upon his wife and for that reason he was denied widower's benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.278" offset="1277604">He then brought this suit in District Court and the District Court declared the support test as to widowers unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.510" offset="1310518">Relying in large part upon this Court’s opinions in Wiesenfeld that is Weinberger against Wiesenfeld and Frontiero against Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.992" offset="1356493">Before turning to a discussion of those two cases which underpin the appellee’s arguments here, I would like to make some general observations about the appellee’s arguments on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.875" offset="1411977">Although appellee is a man and it is the denial of benefits to himself that he complains of, he has sought to portray the statutory classification as discriminating principally against women.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.225" offset="1469342">He contends that the real discrimination here is against the deceased working wives whose widowers must now prove support.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.356" offset="1501943">That is largely against the deceased working wives of civil servants.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.433" offset="1526185">Of course, as an analytical matter the discrimination if any, bears equally upon these widowers and their deceased working wives.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.220" offset="1573310">These two categories, one male and one female, necessarily are present here in a one to one ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.565" offset="1606746">That suggests that this case does not involve sex discrimination at all, but rather discrimination, if any, against certain kinds of families that is appellee’s kind of family.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.418" offset="1658155">But putting that aside at a minimum, all other things being equal, the choice of which sex to characterize is the disadvantage class here would appear to a matter of purely rhetorical significance, yet all other things are not equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.024" offset="1736523">There is no legislative motive here to discriminate against women.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.847" offset="1751883">Congress plainly designed the support test, simply to deny benefits to non-needy widowers, such as appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.513" offset="1782498">The difference in treatment is aimed at men not at women.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.812" offset="1803710">Since this is so it may seem all the more puzzling, why the appellee has worked so hard to characterize the support test as discriminating principally against women.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.255" offset="1853447">But there are suspect three good reasons for this approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.136" offset="1872986">First, appellee is attempting to obscure the fact that what he seeks here is a double benefit that is it is a windfall in a nature of Social Security survivors’ benefits on top of the civil service pension.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="458.064" stopTime="463.979">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="458.064" offset="1932755">Yeah, but if he were -- if the genders were reversed she would get this windfall, right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="463.979" stopTime="467.556">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="463.979" offset="1956369">That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart that is the loophole.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.245" offset="1969430">Widows would get the benefit.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="467.556" stopTime="474.564">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="467.556" offset="1970684">Well, anytime if somebody does not like a provision of the law he calls it a loophole, this is a provision of the law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="474.564" stopTime="508.288">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="474.564" offset="1998688">Sometimes they call it unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.336" offset="2021780">But it does seem to me that the appellee understandably seeks to divert the Court’s attention away from the obvious rationality of Congress’ decision to deny him this double benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.008" offset="2072457">In that purpose I would like to frustrate that it is claimed here that what he seeks is a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.957" offset="2096281">It is true, it is a windfall that is available to women and of a special narrow class, but that does not mean it is a constitutional matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.383" offset="2125956">It should also be made available to him.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="508.288" stopTime="510.140">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="508.288" offset="2133584">Well that is the question in this case, isn’t it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="510.140" stopTime="733.746">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="510.140" offset="2141003">That is correct Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.828" offset="2151765">I think the second reason that the appellee seeks to characterize this as a women’s rights case, but that the cause of women’s is now a fashionable one and the appellee seeks to ride on its skirt tails, but it is the responsibility of this Court to act on the basis of what reflects a proper accommodation of the respective roles of Congress and the Courts and not to act on the basis of what maybe favored by the shifting tides of extra judicial legal fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.385" offset="2286035">But the third reason by appellee maybe characterizing this as a women’s rights case is the one that disturbs me the most.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.393" offset="2322084">Appellee maybe implicitly suggesting, that the rights of women are constitutionally entitled to higher protection than the rights of men.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.094" offset="2360849">As a lawyer and as a member of the class that would thereby be disadvantaged I would urge this Court to reject any such settled suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.292" offset="2397630">Women constitute a majority of the voting age population in this country, unlike racial minorities for example, women have the political power, if they choose to use it to remedy any statutory inequality of which they perceive themselves to be the victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.651" offset="2475057">In short, women are not a discrete insular minority that requires special judicial protection against an indifferent or a hostile legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.855" offset="2523853">This is not to say that women have not been subject to legal and social discrimination in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.572" offset="2550812">That history of discrimination justifies remedial legislation that extends to women certain benefits or opportunities that may not be made available on the same basis to men.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.602" offset="2602848">This Court so held in Kahn against Shevin, but further than that, the Courts may not go.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.995" offset="2628448">Men and women are entitled to the same stature under the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.480" offset="2646420">The ssame constitutional analysis must apply whether the discrimination of which appellee complaints is directed against men or against women.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.141" offset="2693022">With these preliminary thoughts in mind, I would now turn to discussion of this Court’s opinions in Frontiero and Wiesenfeld.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.703" offset="2735236">Statutory classification at issue in Frontiero was conceitedly, superficially quite similar to the one involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.073" offset="2776719">But superficial similarities of that kind are largely irrelevant to equal protection analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.165" offset="2805140">At the heart of any equal protection inquiry is whether the challenge classification is rationally related to a permissible and a substantial legislative objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.248" offset="2849444">In Frontiero the differential treatment accorded men and women, furthered no objective other than mere administrative convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.246" offset="2881417">The Government so conceited and this Court so held, and that objective the Court held was insufficiently substantial that justified the difference in treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.427" offset="2922168">That rationale is not applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.623" offset="2934916">The statutory classification challenged here is not routed in mere administrative convenience.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.669" offset="2963128">Instead, as I will show momentarily, the classification reflects Congress’ legitimate efforts rationally to allocate source that scarce, Social Security’s moneys on the basis of the probable needs of competing classes, special beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.651" offset="3031047">Yes Mr. Justice Stevens.</text>

            <text syncTime="752.515" offset="3110564">Well, the rational bases or the social welfare considerations on which the Government relies here are spelled out at length at Pages 15 to 36 of our main Brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.140" offset="3173048">But I can summarize them here.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.071" offset="3184751">The Social Security provisions for widows and widowers have a separate and different history.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.796" offset="3211710">In 1939, Congress determined to pay monthly benefits to those groups of survivors whose probable need was the greatest and it identified those groups, its elderly widows, dependent children and aged dependent parents and although a major purpose of the support test, excuse me, of the survivors’ benefits was to replace the support lost by a dependant upon the death of the wage earner.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.762" offset="3343471">Congress did not restrict widow’s benefits to those women who were in fact dependant upon their husbands and the reasons for this Mr. Justice Stevens were too full.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.946" offset="3388297">First, in 1939 and for many years thereafter, very few aged women were in fact economically dependent upon their husbands and to impose the support test, would have placed a substantial burden upon all of those widows and upon the administrative agency as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.841" offset="3479830">That burden would have been incurred to weed out a very small percentage of non-dependent women.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.200" offset="3509297">The appellee here conceits, that the imposition of the support test upon widows would entail, and I quote from Pages 65 and 68 of his Brief, "an exorbitant administrative burden, a potentially monstrous proportion".</text>
            <text syncTime="868.039" offset="3572617">That is the appellee’s language that is not our language, so that to some extent Mr. Justice Stevens, you are correct that the extension of benefits to women does have some basis at administrative convenience, but at the same time, the non-dependent women who would have been weeded out by a support test, are very likely to have been needy in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.686" offset="3683168">Then the women who had passed the support test that is the women who receive less than half their support from their husbands are very likely to have been either deserted or to have been living in other circumstances of substantial need.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.687" offset="3743249">Very few aged widows were truly self sufficient and it was both reasonable and should remain for Congress to extend widow's benefits to these women without regard to dependency.</text>

            <text syncTime="1369.815" offset="5579762">The criterion was considered substantially, rationally related to a need to distinguish between those who would need additional support and those who did not and this statute serves exactly the same purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.874" offset="5643919">Now, it is true that we have here, as we did in Lucas, a problem of overinclusiveness.</text>

            <text syncTime="1428.668" offset="5815177">The Wiesenfeld opinion must be conceded contains language that have taken a face value, but requires a widower support test to be struck down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.983" offset="5856451">The Court stated that “The constitution forbids gender based differentiation that results in the efforts of female workers producing less protection for their families and as produced by the efforts of men.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.481" offset="5914443">But that statement can not be lifted bodily and applied out of context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.424" offset="5934191">In the first place, the statement was made with regard to a statute that the Court found have no rational basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.802" offset="5959687">The Court’s rationale in Wiesenfeld was that the statutory bar against father’s benefits was inconsistent with the legislative purpose providing children deprived with one parent with the opportunity for the personal attention of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.050" offset="6024679">Neither that rationale, nor any similar rationale, is available here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.293" offset="6045682">The support test for widowers is fully consistent, I submit with the underlined legislative purpose of restricting benefits to those groups that may largely be presumed to be non-need, excuse me, to be needy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.729" offset="6103360">But secondly, if the statement in Wiesenfeld were detached from its factual context, it would amount to a per se constitutional rule, that is what appellee suggest that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.882" offset="6156023">But the Due Process Clause affords no basis for such a rule, such a flat declaration of what Congress may not do in the Social Security Act would, I submit, constitute a radical and unwise departure from historical principles of equal protection that would allow no way to be given to governmental interest that might be served by a particular gender based classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.054" offset="6260722">This Court has always given way to such interest in equal protection cases in the past and it should do so here. Mr. Chief Justice, I would like to reserve my remaining time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1574.374" offset="6398022">Pursuant to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, payments into Social Security's old age and survivors’ insurance program are exacted from gainfully employed men and women without regard to the sex of the contributor, whether the wage earner is a man or a woman, equal earnings require equal contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.354" offset="6485897">In contrast to the gender neutral contribution system the program draws a sharp line between the sexes amid pay outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.437" offset="6522260">Benefits to a spouse available under a male wage earner’s account are not equally available under a female wage earner’s account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.864" offset="6555906">The Court below ruled that this separate and unequal payout system discriminates invidiously against the wage earning woman and her spouse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.851" offset="6595925">That decision and all other, five other, the Federal Court judgments on the same point. Solidly anchored to this Court’s 1973 judgment in Frontiero v. Richardson and 1975 decision in Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.026" offset="6676591">Thus the issue on which this appeal turns is cleanly posed, do Frontiero and Wiesenfeld impart principled cses for deciding gender discrimination cases formed from the same mould or all the Frontiero and Wiesenfeld precedence shallow and evanescent as the Secretary would have it today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.045" offset="6780663">In Wiesenfeld the Court declared unconstitutional, the Social Security Act's provision of a mother’s benefit, but no father’s benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.081" offset="6816817">When Wiesenfeld was presented to this Court, the Solicitor General described the gender differential varied issue as very closely analogous to the one at par, and in Frontiero the Court held unconstitutional a military fringe benefit arrangement displaying a gender line, virtually identical to the one at par.</text>

            <text syncTime="3248.499" offset="13094459">Mr. Justice Stevens, if you believe that this statute was constitutional when first enacted and that recent social history has largely eroded the factual basis on which the classification originally depended, I would think that the appropriate remedy would not be to determine in the first instance that this statute is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.830" offset="13191844">I do not think that this Court should sit as a committee of revision on the Social Security Act in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.250" offset="13217444">It seems to me that if you believe that recent social history has undercut the foundation of the act in this respect, you should advice Congress of the fact that changing events have cast serious doubt upon the continued viability of this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.097" offset="13288810">But you should give to Congress the opportunity to sort out this very complicated matter which -- no matter how this Court would dispose off it -- would result in an irrational and unfair allocation of Social Security moneys.</text>
