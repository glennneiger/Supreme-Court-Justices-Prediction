            <text syncTime="46.273" offset="285599">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.422" offset="298138">This case arises out of $700,000 loan that was made by Third National Bank to certain borrowers to finance the construction of a commercial office building.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.651" offset="335128">The payment of the loan was secured by deed of trust under the terms of which certain real property was conveyed to a trustee, who was granted the power to sell the property, in the event of default.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.957" offset="380372">The loan was originally made in May of 1973 and originally matured in May of 74.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.608" offset="406912">However, at the borrowers’ request three different extensions of the maturity date were granted, the last of which expired in July 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.339" offset="445887">In August of 1975, the bank determined that the loan was in default and in September 1975, the bank gave the requisite notice of foreclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.988" offset="488414">The process of foreclosure in Tennessee is an exercise of private contractual right and is not accomplished through judicial means.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.344" offset="521851">After the notice of foreclosure was given, the respondents filed this action in the Tennessee Chancery Court seeking to enjoin the foreclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.460" offset="550377">The chancellor granted a temporary injunction restraining the bank from foreclosing.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.324" offset="569812">The bank then moved to dissolve the temporary injunction relying on the provisions of 12 United States Code Section 91.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.240" offset="601472">The chancellor granted that motion holding that Section 91 of the Banking Act, forbid a Tennessee Court from enjoining the National Bank prior to foreclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.279" offset="649642">Respondents filed an interlocutory appeal to the Tennessee Supreme Court, which in its decision, judicially created an exception to the anti-injunction proviso of Section 91.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.229" offset="697394">The Tennessee Supreme Court held that the anti-injunction proviso does not apply for a bank’s debtors seeking to restrain the foreclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.045" offset="736682">The structure of my argument will be first to examine the grammatical and historical meeting of the anti-injunction proviso in Section 91, then the decisions of this Court and the State Court’s decisions and having done that to explore, whether under the circumstances present in this case, there is any constitutional impediment to its historic and natural construction.</text>

I have never sold it to you and it turned out to be simply a mistaken identity on the part of your client.</text>

            <text syncTime="250.979" offset="1104381">Yes sir, this Court in 1888, when it decided the case of Pacific National Bank versus Mixter said that it was an absolute prohibition and that the remedy and that was an attachment case and not an injunction case, I do not think that is important.</text>

            <text syncTime="268.310" offset="1173763">Well, but it could be quite important, could it not because if you read the Section of the statute you are relying on is used in generous type I think, attachment and execution are both remedies prior to judgment, initiated by a plaintiff and certainly you could read this word injunction is being so limited.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.809" offset="1679702">Justice Stevens, I am not saying that I concede how the statute would be read under those extreme cases.</text>

          </turn>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="406.474" offset="1726409">Well, if one could distinguish between tort and contract, could one also not distinguish as your opponent does, between cases in which the plaintiff is a creditor and those in which he is a debtor?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_p_kanaday_jr" startTime="415.999" stopTime="765.093">
            <label>Mr. Thomas P. Kanaday, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="415.999" offset="1764444">Yes, but I am not saying that the statute affords us the liberty to make those distinctions either between tort, contract, debtor, creditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.086" offset="1816793">I am relying on to the facts of this case where there is a private contractual right that there is an absolute prohibition on the statute from the interference prior to final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.568" offset="1862768">If there is any confusion about the proper construction of anti-injunction proviso, it arises that because in its present form, Section 91 as an amalgam of two unrelated statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.158" offset="1909162">The first portion of the statute, voids preferential transfers of property by Insolvent National Banks, the second portion of Section 91 prohibits a state court from issuing attachments, injunctions and executions against a National Bank prior to final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.057" offset="1972692">The issue in this case of course, is rather a State Court can issue an injunction against a National Bank before closing on collateral, prior to final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.126" offset="2025041">Now, because of the holding of the Tennessee Supreme Court, I think another way of stating the issue is whether the preceding language relating to preferential transfers in some manner does restrict the otherwise, unqualified meaning and unqualified language of the anti-injunction proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.472" offset="2098393">Until, 1864, a National Bank could not even be sued in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.564" offset="2118768">In that year, a statute was adopted affording jurisdiction and actions against National Banks in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.339" offset="2145831">In 1873, the Congress adopted the anti-injunction proviso as a limitation upon the jurisdiction of state courts to grant certain types of remedy at certain stages of the litigation in the state court proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.685" offset="2223258">In 1873, there was a revision of the banking and the judiciary code and as a result of this revision, there was an inadvertent deletion of the anti-injunction proviso and it was left out of the code for some two years by mere inadvertence.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.241" offset="2285430">Then, in 1875, there was another revision of the code and the anti-injunction proviso reappeared without explanation at the end of the Section which rewarded preference of transfers by Insolvent National Banks and it has remained in that position through the present day.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.642" offset="2355020">It was in that position when this court issued its decisions in Mixter, Van Red and Earle.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.241" offset="2389501">The Tennessee Supreme Court reached the result that it did by taking the erroneous view that “We look to the purpose of the statute which was to secure the assets of a bank whether solvent or insolvent for ratable distributions among its general creditors.”</text>
            <text syncTime="591.004" offset="2464525">We say that was not the purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.563" offset="2474765">The clear purpose was to limit the jurisdiction of the state court to grant extraordinary remedies at a certain stage in the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.917" offset="2500156">There was a limitation on the Jurisdictional Grant of the 1864 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.159" offset="2521159">The first case that this court has decided on it was Mixter, Pacific National Bank of Boston versus Mixter which in 1888 held that the anti-injunction proviso nullified an attachment which had been obtained by a creditor of a national bank against funds of that bank on deposit in another bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.428" offset="2606213">The Court clearly rejected the argument that the anti-injunction proviso of Section 91 is somehow limited by its preceding provisions awarding preferential transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.441" offset="2646233">The court said, “As it stood originally, as part of Section 57, after 1873 and as stands now in the revised statute, it operates as a prohibition upon all attachments against national banks, under the authority of state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.478" offset="2714360">The form of its reenactment in the revised statute does not change its meaning in this particular.</text>
            <text syncTime="660.227" offset="2741423">All attachment laws of this state must be read as if they contained in expressed terms that they were not able to apply to suit against a national bank, the remedy is taken away all together and cannot be used under any circumstances” and it was further said, that “If the power of issuing attachments has been taken away from the state court, so also is the power of issuing injunctions that is true.”</text>
            <text syncTime="686.247" offset="2845495">And that was, this Court’s unanimous construction of the statute in 1888.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.773" offset="2875588">The Mixter case then was followed by the case of Earle versus State of Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.791" offset="2895650">In that case, a creditor of a bank customer sought to reach funds on deposit in the bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.163" offset="2917175">The bank claimed no interest in the funds and was a mere stakeholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.326" offset="2929818">This court concluded that this was not an action against a bank or its property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.043" offset="2948626">It is interesting to note that the Supreme Court in the Earle decision dissolved the attachment against stock which the bank held is collateral for a loan of that customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.501" offset="2986452">But unhappily, we do not have a statement of the reasoning of the court and doing this, presumably because of the applicability of the anti-injunction proviso.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.611" offset="3026889">The present case is clearly not within the ambit of the exception in the Earle case.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.930" offset="3048205">For in the present case, the proceeding is brought by the respondents against a national bank as named party defendant and obviously the injunction which they seek would materially affect the bank property rights and its collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.048" offset="3108705">The final decision was in 1905 in Van Reed versus People's National Bank, which reaffirmed the holding of Mixter again in an attachment case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.392" offset="4950024">You Honor I think that the statute clearly on its face, means that its purpose is to protect creditors from ratable distribution, protect the assets of the bank from ratable distribution among its creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.911" offset="5012091">The statute defines; it is self defining in that the heading of it regulates transfers by banks and other acts in contemplation of insolvency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.670" offset="5067157">It goes further after that heading and it prohibits transfers, assignments, payments of money of committed act or an act of insolvency or in contemplation there off with a view to prevent the application of the banks’ assets in a court with the National Banking Act and with a view to prefer one creditor over another, then Your Honor, it has a semicolon and it says and no attachment or no injunction attachment or garnishment will issue against any bank, against any, in their case it says state bank, pending a final hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.807" offset="5239774">It says also against the bank or its assets and I submit there is an important clause, but Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justice I submit that it is free and clear of ambiguity, that you cannot pull the last clause of that, that entire statute it is one sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.137" offset="5321067">I submit that you cannot pull the last clause and apply to wherever it is that you want to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.359" offset="5349906">I submit that this is good law and I would like to say initially that I do not argue or that responded does not argue with that law, but the petitioner goes further and says that this court has ruled three times, that the courts cannot interfere with national banks to protect the assets of its debtors pending a final hearing, always pending a final hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.581" offset="5474772">Now, I submit that these cases did not hold that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.530" offset="5494625">I would like to take a very quick look at Mixter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.512" offset="5510507">Mixter was decided by Chief Justice White or Mixter was an opinion written by Chief Justice White in 1888.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.522" offset="5538615">In that particular case, the bank owed Mixter $15,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.911" offset="5564110">Mixter began a suit by attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.539" offset="5574664">Now, the bank was not insolvent on the date apparently that that attachment issued, but just prior day too, it closed its doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.187" offset="5633283">Then it resumed business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.220" offset="5641328">During the resumption of business, the attachment issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.675" offset="5663167">Now, I would like to say to the court that in the Mixter case, I have felt that it must be a typographical error because the year was one year preceding the period of time that is involved and I think when the court reads that case, it will see what I mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.208" offset="5725338">Nevertheless, the bank was in severe financial difficulty at that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.153" offset="5761074">This would be I think the obvious reason why the court extended or appear to extend the statute to mean that the banks did not have to be insolvent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.334" offset="5817812">The Earle case decided by the court in written and the opinion written by Justice Harlan in 1900 did not go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.102" offset="5860861">This was a case in which one Mr. Long as I recall had a judgment for some $31,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.260" offset="5925541">An attachment issued by garnishment and the court in that instance hailed that this last clause related back to the rest of the Section.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.098" offset="5992937">Now, it also in that instance went on to say that this was not an asset of the bank, but nevertheless it clearly allowed the attachment by garnishment to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.331" offset="6045808">There is then another case, this is Van Reed decision written by Mr. Justice Dave (ph) in 1905 and this case was another simple attachment by a creditor, in which event the court related back to the Mixter case and extended the statute to apply beyond insolvency, but I submit to the court that these banks clearly protect or these cases clearly protect the bank against interferences of its asserts by the creditors.</text>

            <text syncTime="2103.674" offset="8515216">Tennessee Law as Mr. Kanaday stated to the Court earlier, has a five-day notice requirement.</text>

            <text syncTime="2431.409" offset="9826145">First of all, that the statute on its face is free of ambiguity.</text>

            <text syncTime="2445.164" offset="9881106">Third; that the construction they seek would render in violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2475.188" offset="10001270">First of all now, there is nothing here which would interfere with the bank’s rights, ultimately.</text>

            <text syncTime="2507.233" offset="10129479">If the Court finds at that time that there are no irreparable damages in the picture and no showing of irreparable damages, then there will not be an injunction granted.</text>

            <text syncTime="2646.468" offset="10686409">If as the Tennessee Supreme Court held and if as the respondent urges on this court the prohibition against the issuing of injunctions is somehow, constricted by the preceding language in Section 91 relating to preferential transfers to condition to Insolvent Banks to the securing of a bank’s assets for ratable distributions among its creditors, then, this court find it necessary to ignore the statutory context in which the anti-injunction proviso was adopted and that was as an amendment to the statute conferring jurisdiction on State Courts to hear actions against National Banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.473" offset="10894344">It will not only be necessary to ignore the context of its enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.076" offset="10916809">It will be necessary to ignore the decision of this Court in the Van Reed case while in the Mixter case, as Mrs. Pigg stated, there was no insolvency in the bank at the time that the attachment arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.717" offset="10979399">It did become an insolvent, but the Van Reed decision dispelled any notion that the application of anti-injunction proviso is in anyway limited by the state of dissolvency of the bank in question or the securing of assets for ratable distribution to its creditors and then make that quite explicit in the Van Reed opinion, there's no intimation that the bank and Van Reed was insolvent or was having financial difficulties or had committed preferential.</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.021" offset="11224532">Now, I take if there's nothing in that statutory procedure that would violate what you refer to as the anti-injunction provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3175.384" offset="12802014">I think that policy that is expressed in this act is a concern incident to the Federal regulation of the national banks for the liquidity of the banks, for the ability to immediately realize on important types of assets that are within the bank’s control.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.122" offset="12881008">That asset maybe a bank account as it was in Mixter, the asset maybe or the property right which is important to the solvency and the continuing management of the bank, maybe it is collateral, banking up a loan.</text>

            <text syncTime="3289.183" offset="13257276">Mr. Justice Stevens, I must admit that because I view the entire injunction proviso as a limitation on the congressional grant of jurisdiction to State Courts that you got me into that corner and if I am going to be faithful to that position, I suppose view it as a jurisdictional limitation that it might well do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.329" offset="13369812">Yes sir.</text>
