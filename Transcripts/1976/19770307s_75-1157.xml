            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="13.803" offset="155726">This case is here on appeal from the United States District Court for the Western District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.366" offset="185923">New York law provides that a new county charter will go into effect only if it is approved in a referendum election by separate majorities of the voter's who live in the cities within the county and of those who live outside the cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.178" offset="253215">A three-judge Federal District Court held that these requirements violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.487" offset="282472">And a direct appeal brought the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.520" offset="298563">For the reason set out in some detail in the written opinion of the Court filed today, we have concluded that the provisions of New York law here in question no more than recognized the substantially different electoral interests of city dwellers and non-city dwellers in a new county charter, in view of the realities of the overlapping and competing local governmental units in the political structure of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.440" offset="418308">Granting to these provisions of New York law, the presumption of constitutionality to which every duly enacted state and federal law is entitled, we hold that they do not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.884" offset="480062">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.954" offset="492287">The Chief Justice does not join the opinion of the Court, but concurs only in the judgment.</text>
