            <text syncTime="13.228" offset="153530">This case is here from the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.023" offset="172651">It involves a challenge to a New York reapportionment in so far as that statute applied to Kings County.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.970" offset="216537">The challenge was and is that the -- that the -- that the State impermissibly used racial criteria in drawing certain district lines in the -- in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.490" offset="270558">The Court of Appeals rejected that challenge and we affirm that judgment by both of seven to one.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.098" offset="305040">Mr. Justice Marshall takes no part in this case and Chief Justices filed the dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.142" offset="329177">I have filed an opinion which gives two essentially independent reasons for the -- for the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.199" offset="373376">Neither reason commands a majority to the Court but there are five justices who joined one or the -- joined one or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.835" offset="411933">The first reason is that what the State did was authorized by the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.229" offset="441504">The second reason is that without any help in the Voting Rights Act, what New York did violated neither the Fourteenth nor the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.642" offset="495211">In the first reason, Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Stevens joined me.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.048" offset="532828">And in the second reason, Mr. Justice Regnquist and Mr. Justice Stevens, in any event the judgment is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.071" offset="568877">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.704" offset="583401">Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a -- an opinion concurring the judgment and he is joined by Mr. Justice Powell.</text>
