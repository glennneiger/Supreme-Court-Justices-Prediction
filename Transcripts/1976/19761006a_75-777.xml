          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="67.583" stopTime="616.267">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="67.583" offset="370840">Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.206" offset="389335">This case is here on Certiorari to the District of Columbia Circuit which sitting on banc and dividing five to four, denied enforcement of the Board’s order against responding union.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.528" offset="446595">The question presented is whether a union engages in an unlawful secondary boycott within the meaning of Section 8(b)4(B) of the National Labors Relations Act, when it causes the employees of a firm of which the union has a collective bargaining agreement containing a work preservation clause to handle prefabricated goods that their employers contract with the general contractor obliges the employer to install.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.394" offset="586089">This was a question which was mooted, but not decided in National Woodwork, a 1967 decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.446" offset="630288">The facts are briefly these.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.099" offset="640842">Austin the engineer and general contractor for construction of a home for the aged in Brooklyn, specified the use of climate control units, manufactured by Slant/Fin Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.013" offset="708551">Under these specifications, Slant/Fin was to cut thread and install at the factory the internal piping on the units which carried a one-year warranty contingent upon factory fabrication of the internal piping.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.178" offset="797158">As a result of competitive bidding, Austin awarded a subcontract for the heating, ventilating and air conditioning work on the home to Hudik.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.407" offset="846060">This work included as Hudik was aware, installation of the Slant/Fin units.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.904" offset="880123">Now Hudik, the subcontractor had a collective bargaining agreement with the respondent union, a local of the Plumbers and Steamfitters Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.314" offset="925681">Rule IX of this agreement provided among other things that radiators branches, convector branches and coil connections shall be cut and threaded by hand on the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.113" offset="984927">Shortly after the Slant/Fin units which had been purchased by Austin arrived on the job site, the union business agent went to Austin, the general contractor and informed him, his project superintendent, the union’s members would not install the Slant/Fin units because the piping inside the units was Steamfitter’s work and the business agent then went to Hudik and told him essentially the same thing, adding that the prefabrication of the internal piping in the units was in violation of Rule IX of the collective agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.276" offset="1169560">As a result, Hudik’s employees refused to install the Slant/Fin units, where upon Austin filed an unfair labor practice charge with the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.653" offset="1211043">The Board concluded that the union’s refusal to install the Slant/Fin units was a secondary boycott in violation of Section 8(b)4(B) because the Board found it, while the refusal of Hudik’s employees to install these units was based on a valid work preservation clause in the agreement with Hudik and was to the purpose of preservation work they had traditionally performed, Hudik was incapable of assigning this work to his employees, and therefore, the union in exerting strike pressure on Hudik, had coupled it's work preservation objective with an unlawful secondary objective of also trying to change Austin’s manner of doing business with Slant/Fin.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.612" offset="1442905">Now, Board entered an appropriate remedial order and the Court of Appeals as I indicated denied enforcement of the Board’s order, the Court, majority of the Court finding that the Board’s reliance upon Hudik’s lack of power to assign the work was inconsistent with the principles annunciated by this Court in National Woodwork.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.130" offset="1544992">I would like to turn to National Woodwork, Section 8(b)4(B) makes it an unfair labor practice for a labor organization or it's agents to exert strike pressure against an employer for an object, of forcing any person to cease using handling or otherwise dealing in the products of any other person or to cease doing business with any other person.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.630" offset="1686994">A proviso states that this provision shall not be construed to make unlawful, any primary strike or primary pickets.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.497" offset="1738507">Now, as this Court recognized shortly after the 47 Amendments which added the secondary boycott provision to the Act that Section 8(b)4(B) must be interpreted so as to foster the dual congressional objective of preserving the right of labor organizations to bring pressure on offending employers and primary labor disputes, and of shielding unoffending employers from pressures and controversies not their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.522" offset="1894510">Now, the text of achieving this accommodation is a very, very difficult one.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.583" offset="1922827">For the distinction between legitimate primary and illegal secondary activity as this Court has indicated is rarely a glaringly price line.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.683" offset="1975176">Union activity is secondary, if an object of the activity is to force cessation of a change in business relations between two entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.416" offset="2018122">On the other hand, the objectives of even primary activity includes the desire to influence others to withhold their patronage from the employer against whom the pressure is exerted and some union activity, which I submit is this case, who have both a primary object and a secondary object and in that event the activity is unlawful for Section 8(b)(4) prescribes activity, if an object is secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.304" offset="2157720">Now, let me illustrate the way these principles were applied in National Woodwork and try to point out the difference that the Board sees between the situation here and that which was before the Court in National Woodwork.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.599" offset="2230863">The issue in National Woodwork was whether a union that engaged in a lawful secondary boycott by refusing to permit its members who are employed by Frouge a general contractor to install prefabricated doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.832" offset="2311843">Finishing doors was worked and Frouge’s employees had traditionally performed on the job site and the collective agreement had a work preservation clause similar to one here which provided that Frouge’s employees would not be required to handle doors if it has been finished off the job site.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.643" offset="2399092">The employees struck when Frouge nevertheless ordered the pre-finished doors, although he was not required to do so, on his contract with the project owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.440" offset="2458233">The court stated that the determination whether the union’s activity was primary or secondary turned on whether hope from the Court under all the surrounding circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.999" offset="2512463">The union’s object was preservation of work for Frouge's employees or whether the agreements and the boycott were tactically calculated to satisfy union objectives elsewhere.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="616.267" stopTime="625.556">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="616.267" offset="2565544">Well, Mr. Come, assume there has been no provision in the contract and that the strike otherwise would not have violated the contract, the result would have been the same.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="625.556" stopTime="742.940">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="625.556" offset="2602742">That is correct Your Honor and I think that the contract does not make the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.627" offset="2642971">The question is whether the activity that was engaged in is secondary or primary.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.411" offset="2674109">Now, applying the text that I outlined to the facts in National Woodwork, the Court found that the contract clause was a valid work preservation clause, therefore, no violation of 8(e) and that the facts established that the union’s object in invoking the clause against Frouge was solely the preservation of the traditional task of jobsite carpenters.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.107" offset="2796884">Frouge had the option of prescribing pre-finished doors or not prescribing it, it elected to order them and that got him into his problem with the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.406" offset="2882148">Now, the facts here we submit, are different from the situation in National Woodwork and I might say that at the same time that the Board decided National Woodwork, in that very case, you had three subcontractors who were in precisely the same situation that Hudik was in here, the Board had found an 8(b)(4)(b) violation as to them, the Court of Appeals had sustained that finding, but the union did not bring that before the Court and was for that reason that that issue was not before the Court in National Woodwork.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="748.394" offset="3094053">But this court’s decision in National Woodwork upheld the determination of the Board.</text>

          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="754.790" stopTime="847.272">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="754.790" offset="3119653">It upheld the determination of the Board as to Frouge who have the power to control whether or not, his employees were to pay the price of the work of finishing the doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.295" offset="3201678">In contrast, the Frouge, who was free to decide whether or not to use prefabricated doors, Hudik was obligated by his contract with Austin to install the prefabricated climate control units?</text>
            <text syncTime="790.905" offset="3264058">By demanding that Hudik’s employees perform on the jobsite, the internal piping work on these climate control units, the unit was seeking work that Hudik never possessed and did not have a right to obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.595" offset="3326856">Confronted by the union’s demands of the work, Hudik as a practical matter had available only two courses of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.265" offset="3373563">It could have induced, try to induce Austin to change his specifications for the job or failing that to terminate his contract with Austin.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.440" offset="3418285">The second course, like a refusal to bid on the job initially, would not have preserved or produced work for Hudik’s employees, indeed it would have be a loss for them, the rest of the piping work that they had on this job, the first course inducing…</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="847.272" stopTime="857.686">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="847.272" offset="3489547">Well, I suppose Mr. Norton J. Come, there was another alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.089" offset="3500832">It could perhaps negotiate with his employees in payment of bonus, to installing the ducts.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norton_j_come" startTime="857.686" stopTime="1023.863">
            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="857.686" offset="3531238">The Court of Appeals mentions that alternative Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.996" offset="3548479">On this record there was no suggestion that that was ever contemplated by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.766" offset="3587558">On this record, the demand was solely for the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.530" offset="3626638">Now, the first course namely inducing Austin to change its specification would have produced this work only if Austin were willing to do that, so that in these circumstances, you find that whereas the union, to be sure, may have been motivated by a work preservation object.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.276" offset="3745547">It could not have obtained that object without changing the decision of Austin and possibly also Slant/Fin whereas in the Frouge case, Frouge could have granted the union’s demand, primarily changing its own decision, discontinuing ordering pre-finished doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.310" offset="3845753">Now, granted that the line between whether a cessation of business is an object or whether it is just an incident of lawful primary activity, granted that that line is a fine one and it is difficult in some cases to find out which site is aligned, it falls on, we submit that it was at least within the Board’s province to conclude and was reasonable in so concluding that given a situation such as you have here or in order to attain the union’s work preservation objective, the employer pressure, even though he was the employer of the employees involved and only give them what they sought by changing the decisions of third parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.441" offset="4082213">That involves too much of a impairment of the rights of third parties to be regarded as purely incidental to legitimate primary activity and for that reason that the Board was awarded and concluding that the union’s pressure here at least an object included an unlawful secondary one describe by it 8(b)4.</text>

            <text syncTime="1030.876" offset="4224006">The Board did not have an 8(e) charge attacking the validity of the work preservation clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.105" offset="4256920">It assumed that the work preservation clause was lawful because on its face it was susceptible of being applied in a lawful situation and as I indicated in my answer to Justice White’s conclusion, it was not crucial to the Board’s decision to determine whether the clause was lawful or unlawful because whether the clause is lawful or unlawful, you cannot use secondary pressure to implement it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>

            <text syncTime="1115.988" offset="4564434">I want to deal with two situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.069" offset="4572793">In the first place, if the contract was not intended, prior to that it covers finishing piping work on the jobsite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.299" offset="4613648">If it was not intended, however, to apply to a situation, where a sub did not have control over the work, obviously it would not, an action would not lie if one were brought, but it could be brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.422" offset="4682194">On the other hand, if it and whether you determine the legality of the contract from the circumstances under which it was entered into because 8(e) makes it a violation to enter into an illegal agreement and the mere fact the union may unilaterally later seek to apply it to a secondary situation, does not necessarily make the contract unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.865" offset="4815941">So you have the initial question as to whether the contract was intended to cover a situation where Hudik lost control.Assuming that it did then we get into the question as to whether or not the contract would be said nonetheless be safe from illegality by the construction industry proviso to 8(e) which privileges certain subcontracting agreements for what would to be done at the jobsite in the building construction industry, even though those contracts in other industries may violate section 8(e), but even those contracts, a legislative history makes clear cannot be enforced by restricting force and it would violate 8(b)(4), a law suit, and the only way that you could enforce the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.632" offset="5030981">So if I can sum up after giving, I think too long an answer to your question Mr. Justice Marshall, if in fact it is to be determined that this contract was intended to encompass a situation where Hudik lost control over the work, the union maybe able to get damages in a law suit, but it could not resort to economic pressures that would violate 8(b)(4), that is not a question that was before the Board.</text>

            <text syncTime="1902.595" offset="7710830">Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.982" offset="7728385">In National Woodwork as Mr. Come said this Court canvas at least the beginning of this problem and we would emphasize that it did not reach this issue not because it was forecasting a difference, but because as it was explicitly stated in the opinion, the union did not take a cross appeal from, did not file a cross petition from the portion of a case in which it did not prevail, and therefore, the Court said that this further issue was not before them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.092" offset="7860878">However, we do not believe that National Woodwork is immaterial here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.126" offset="7885015">The Court did not simply decide a case on its facts, as five Court of Appeals recognized thereafter, it stated a method of decision, a method of decision for determining what is the primary dispute is stated in the opinion Mr. Come has quoted the operative language and its whether under all these surrounding circumstances, the union’s objective was preservation of work for the employees and this is my addition of the employer who signed the agreement and who has been struck and now going back to the Court or whether the agreements and boycott were tactically calculated to satisfy union objectives elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1995.603" offset="8082918">The touchstone is whether the agreement or its maintenance is addressed to the labor relations of the contracting employer, these are his only employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.900" offset="8132029">That would not attest which was new, but as the opinion demonstrates, it goes all away back to the basic understanding, beginning with Duplex verses Deering, which was a very long time ago and during all the intervening time, there has been an understanding that there is a difference between primary activity and secondary boycott and that the essence of a primary activity and a primary strike is that it is strike by employees against their own employer in defense of there own working conditions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2243.929" offset="9076198">Now, the Board suggests in its reply brief in point one of the reply brief that we overstate the proposition, we overstate the test of what is primarily activity because there can be some situations in which the employees own conditions are matters which they cannot validly strike (Inaudible) and they give the example, suppose the employees wish to have a clause in the agreement saying that they do not have to work on a job where other employers employ non union men or suppose that they negotiate, asked to negotiate an agreement saying that they do not have to handle goods coming from a struck plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2303.956" offset="9316316">In a one view of world we would far prefer working conditions could be anything that affect employees, but we recognized that in those two situations, which are the situations of the Denver Building case and the issue covered by 8(e), Congress has decided that while you could reformulate the matter to say that the immediate employees, who do not want to work on the same job site with non union people are having their working conditions affected, it is only in the most remote way and that the real problem is the problem between the another employer, namely whether he is going to recognize the union and his own employees and is only a derivative affect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.079" offset="9500741">Here the question of whether there is going to be a work preservation agreement and whether these pipe fitters and steamfitters are going to do the work they have done for years is an immediate and direct concern to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.358" offset="9561867">If they worked fewer hours, if they have less work, fewer the more work obviously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.289" offset="9585586">Their wage rates, however high they may be multiplied by fewer hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.535" offset="9606589">They are directly and immediately threatened in the most basic ways and we think that the distinction between the case here where the whole pattern of the Act sanctions, the unions concerned and denominated working conditions, these employees own working conditions and the situation where the employees are really interested in the working conditions and the employment relationship between other employers is plain.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="2454.441" offset="9918282">Well, these are the kinds of calculations that both the employers and unions and their members have to make all the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.861" offset="9955898">The union is saying “Our long run interest is preserving this traditional work.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.207" offset="9977318">The employer’s reply argument is that “I will not be able to bid and secure as much work as I otherwise would.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.077" offset="10008770">And the Union says that “We are prepared for that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.355" offset="10025906">That is our calculation and that is our gamble.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.510" offset="10034474">That is no different from the Union saying, “We want to work for $8 an hour” and the employer saying, “Most of the bids come out in a way which means, that if my labor costs are over 750, I cannot secure the work.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.381" offset="10113991">The Union says, “We think the labor, there is more elasticity in the bid market than you say.</text>
            <text syncTime="2510.796" offset="10143666">We think that we can organize enough of the workers in this area, so that we can maintain our labor condition and we insist on the conditions we ask.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.784" offset="10191627">The whole theory of the Act is that a matter like that is to be worked out between the employer and his employees and they are represented it through bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.319" offset="10225795">If the Union is wrong it is wrong, but that does not mean it is not seeking to preserve its traditional standards or in the wage case I gave to get the wagers that the employees believe are worthwhile for their work and to denominate that as turning from primary to secondary, if the employer accepts a bid for 750 and then says, “I no longer can pay you $8, which is really the Board’s theory, because I no longer have control over the matter,” it seems to us to be a perversion of the whole theory of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.080" offset="10388799">The board’s position, as Mr. Come has indicated is that an employer, who cannot give the employees immediate satisfaction without changing an agreement, he has subsequently reached with someone else, is a neutral.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.005" offset="10476466">It seems to us to be defective on many, many scores.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.828" offset="10491826">Let me begin with one which has already been explored and that is once the two employers have reached their agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.358" offset="10529861">Who is the primary, and there are two possible answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.056" offset="10548669">The Board first ventured the answer in the Western Monolithics case, which Mr. Come mentioned, which is a Ninth Circuit case which eventually became a Ninth Circuit case, that the general contractor becomes the primary because he has the right of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.112" offset="10632887">The Ninth Circuit in an opinion by Judge Eugene Wright said “No, you cannot say that the general contractor with whom the union has no contacts does not bargain, he does not employ any of their members is the primary and the Board was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.625" offset="10715016">As Mr. Come indicates, subsequently in the Board case, there has been a suggestion that no one is the primary, that whereas at the time the agreement was negotiated, the Union would have had the right of enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.926" offset="10772172">Once their employer enters into an agreement with somebody else, there is no primary and we think that that is flatly inconsistent with the whole theory of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.374" offset="10813968">As I was indicating in my answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist and as this Court has reiterated time and again, most recently in the Machines case, Preemption case last year, the theory of the Act is to center a labor conflict in the bargaining unit of an employer and his employees and the theory of the Act is that so long is it dealing with lawful mandatory subjects of bargaining, what the wages are, what work the employees will insist on doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.084" offset="10960776">That is a matter not to be settled, not by outside parties, but by a test of economic strength, if reason is either side sees it fails and to say that employers can by agreements among themselves, change the situation entirely and create a situation where even though the Union does not enter into a no strike clause and thereby retains its right to enforce its agreement by its normal strike weapon, it has lost that strike weapon, it has nobody against whom it could employ economic force if there is no primary dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.151" offset="11129109">It seems to us to be flatly and absolutely inconsistent with the genius of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.244" offset="11161501">I would like in conclusion, because I think my time is up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.604" offset="11190863">I would like at this point to turn to a discussion of two cases in this Court upon which the Board places reliance and which we think they misunderstand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2789.358" offset="11257945">The first is the Denver Building case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.926" offset="11268185">In Denver building, the crux of the dispute was the fact “A” subcontractor on a jobsite was employing non-union labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2803.721" offset="11315310">The unions who are concerned about that did not go to the subcontractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.498" offset="11338507">Rather they went to the general contractor and told him that they wanted the subcontractor off the job or convert it into a union contractor or else they were going to strike and the Board found that that was a violation of 8(b)(4)(B).</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.555" offset="11402664">Now, it seems to us that the plainness of Denver building trades is that the – who has the ultimate economic control is not determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.413" offset="11462118">It is plain that the general contractor in the Denver case had the right of control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.638" offset="11495033">He could both originally as you were pointing out Mr. Justice Stewart, have given the contract to somebody else and he could have terminated the contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.254" offset="11545501">He could have told the subcontractor that he had to operate union on that job, at least or maybe over all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.165" offset="11585103">Yet, the Board found and this Court agreed that that was a secondary boycott.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.832" offset="11615823">We do not understand how the Board can draw any conflict from the proposition that a union which has its real dispute with a sub can strike the general when right here what the union is trying to do is strike the sub who is the person who employs the employees who have a complaint and the person who entered into the collective agreement which begins the matter in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.871" offset="11731911">The second case in this Court that the Board mentions, second case that the Board mentions in this Court is the Sand Door case, the carpenter’s case in 357 U.S. which Mr. Come has mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.262" offset="11801501">Prior to 1959 and under the Sand Door rule, there were agreements that the parties could enter into which were lawful, but which the Union could not enforce by collective economic action, even against the employer with whom they had entered into the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2950.303" offset="11901707">The theory of Sand Door with which we agree is that while both contracts were lawful under the statute as it stood then, they could not turn what was otherwise a secondary boycott into primary activity and we do not argue here that the original agreement turn what would otherwise be secondary activity into primary activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.827" offset="12027826">We simply say that the original agreement was a traditional…</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="3292.428" offset="13270210">Because our understanding is that it relates only to contracting and subcontracting of work on a site and here the problem is in part, a problem of what work is to be done offsite and what work is to be done onsite.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.905" offset="13332068">Therefore, our source of validation is that the agreement, the desire of these employees to preserve their traditional work is a primary demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.098" offset="13396852">It is the same type of demand a group of factory workers could make, saying we do not want you to contract out assembly line work which we have always done in this plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3335.921" offset="13444185">Mr. Gold, putting it a little different, your contention if the contract is legal is because you understand that it is within the rationale of National Woodwork, is it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence Gold</label>
            <text syncTime="3343.931" offset="13476159">Absolutely and I cannot add to that and I will not try.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.057" offset="13512731">I want to point out although it is a secondary aspect of our argument that the Board says that we must have an object, a secondary object in this case because the employer has only two choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.820" offset="13611787">Either he can cease doing, the employer Hudik, either he can cease doing business with Austin or he can attempt to get a change in the agreement between Austin and himself and as the Court of Appeals pointed out, there is a third option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.820" offset="13687751">If somebody breaches an agreement, he can seek to pay a premium or some other compensation for the breaching dead on with the work as Mr. Come indicates that is not a choice that any contract breaker really relishes, but to say that it does not exist and that there are only two choices seems to us to be illogical in the extreme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.525" offset="13810527">Finally, I do want to note – I do want to take up a point that the Board makes in its reply brief in terms of the so called secondary object conjoined with primary object.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.917" offset="13876146">It is our view that that type of approach destroys the primary secondary dichotomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.559" offset="13922749">Let me give two examples in addition to the example here to show that this is not a sue generous situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.408" offset="13958066">Suppose that the employees meet and discuss the matter among themselves and decide that they do not want to work weekends, that is hardly an unrealistic hypothetical as the members of the Court who heard the Jewel Tea case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.704" offset="14027238">Well remember, thereafter their employer enters into an agreement with somebody else which requires him to have three shifts, seven days a week in order to complete the work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.598" offset="14078856">As we understand the Board’s theory, this primary agreement becomes unenforceable, because the employer has given away his right of control, he would have to renegotiate his agreement with the general contractor from whom he accepted this bid, knowing that was inconsistent with the agreement he had made with the union.</text>
