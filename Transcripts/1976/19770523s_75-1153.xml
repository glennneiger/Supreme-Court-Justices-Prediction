            <text syncTime="11.839" offset="147883">This case is here on direct appeal from the Court of Appeals of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.265" offset="173587">The State of Michigan has enacted legislation authorizing union representation of local governmental employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.652" offset="215070">A union and a local government employer are specifically permitted to agree to an agency shop arrangement whereby every employee represented by a union even though not a union member must pay to the union as extension of employment a service fee to union duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.589" offset="306812">The issue in this case whether this arrangement violates the constitutional rights of government employees who object to public sector unions as such or to various unions' activities finance by the compulsory service fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.817" offset="383716">For the reasons set out at some length in the written opinion of the Court filed with the clerk this morning, we hold that a state law authorizing unionization and an agency shop arrangement for public sector employees in this case, Detroit school teachers is not constitutionally invalid for collective bargaining purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.400" offset="486116">But we further hold that under the First and Fourteenth Amendments, no such employee maybe required to give financial support to the furtherance of any idealogical cause with which he disagrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.403" offset="546093">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Michigan is vacated and the case is remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this Court's opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.345" offset="593845">Mr. Justice Rehnquist and Mr. Justice Stevens while joining the opinion of the Court have each filed concurring opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.390" offset="630103">Mr. Justice Powell has filed an opinion concurring only in the Court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.567" offset="650792">The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Blackmun have joined Mr. Justice Powell's separate opinion.</text>
