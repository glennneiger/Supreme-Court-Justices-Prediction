            <text syncTime="1813.665" offset="7358046">Preference to my remarks I’d like to advice the court that I have somewhat of a speech impediments so if any time I mumble or the Court does not understand any remark, I have to say, please let me know and I’ll attempt to repeat it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.663" offset="7430040">If the Court please in Woodson v. North Carolina, this Court struck down a state law and one of the grounds it gave was because this law failed to provide for the particularized consideration of relevant aspects of the character and record of the defendant affected under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.281" offset="7540485">The Court went on to remark and I quote very briefly, “Justice requires consideration of the character and propensities of the offender.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.827" offset="7590640">And then the Court remarked and I quote again very briefly a comment that “this is a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.100" offset="7663783">Now then the day -- this court has been asked to receive from Woodson from that constitutional principle by emasculating a provision specifically tailored to furnish a trial judge with the kind of information that this court said was constitutionally required before the imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.392" offset="7784991">I’d like digress a moment about as to how this case got here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.840" offset="7818742">It has been urged that counsel didn’t have the confidential part of the PSI report.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.221" offset="7844237">That the Supreme Court of Florida didn’t have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.462" offset="7857194">I’ll tell why they didn’t have it is because trial counsel and the trial court didn’t ask for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.798" offset="7886555">There were two motions for a new trial filed in the trial court and none of those is any mention made that the trial judge erred in refusing to disclose the confidential part of the PSI.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.179" offset="7952071">Because you see, if it had been, then under the Florida rule, the PSI could have been made part of the record on appeal and it would have been before the Supreme Court of our statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3033.205" offset="12236152">Let’s think about this for a minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.259" offset="12248377">In securing information upon which to prosecute a crime, a prosecuting attorney relies on immunity in order to get people to testify in front of a grand jury thus immunity is a tool that he uses to get the information that he needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.370" offset="12324864">Just so then, I say that confidentiality is the tool that the judge can use in getting the needed information to ensure that a just punishment is meted out to a wrong doer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.946" offset="12391111">But even then, in the exercise of the discretion, if the trial judge feels that the confidential aspect of the PSI is of such gravity, he can in the exercise of his discretion, disclose it to the defense attorney so that he may rebut it if he can.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.239" offset="12476374">But petitioner here says -- he says not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.831" offset="12494660">When a trial judge exercises his discretion against disclosure, it is contended before this court that this, ipso facto constitutes a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.476" offset="12557249">It seems to me that the premise that must undergo such an argument as that is that trial judges are simply incapable of separating the wheat from the chaff when reading the PSI and thus whenever the discretion is exercised, against disclosure automatically this results in a due process, a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.005" offset="12675427">Now I deny this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.515" offset="12681383">I can’t subscribe to that.</text>

New York, Mr. Justice Black said it better than I can when writing for a majority of this court and he said, I quote his words, “the Due Process Clause should not be treated as a devise for freezing the evidential procedure of sentencing in the mold of trial procedure.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3196.478" offset="12889318">Well, this court rejected that argument in Williams v. New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.806" offset="12906559">And again, very briefly I’d like to read and I quote, “It is urged however that we should draw a constitutional distinction as to the procedure for obtaining information where the death sentence is imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3216.684" offset="12970088">We cannot accept the contention.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.867" offset="12982836">It’s the words of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.032" offset="12987538">And on down, I quote again, “We cannot say that the Due Process Clause renders a sentence void merely because out of court information, excuse me, void merely because a judge gets additional out of court information to assist him in the exercise of this awesome power of imposing the death penalty or sentence.”</text>
