            <label>Mr. Stuart Bernstein</label>
            <text syncTime="57.681" offset="331250">Alright Sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.640" offset="335012">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.599" offset="346924">This case arises under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.184" offset="369180">It’s primarily concern is the regard if any to be paid to a prior time-barred discriminatory Act and the application of a current, neutral, nondiscriminatory seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.187" offset="429262">United Air Lines like other domestic air carriers in the United States up until November of 1968 maintained a policy which required that its Stewardesses, now called flight attendants, be and remain unmarried and that in November 1968, they entered an agreement with the Air Line Pilots Association, the collective bargaining agent for the flight attendants abrogating this rule, offering reinstatements to those who have been terminated and who have protested through company or federal or state agencies to effect with the discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.009" offset="552560">Reinstatement was offered without back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.476" offset="566353">That policy was ultimately in case of Sprogis v. United Air Lines in the Seventh Circuit to be discrimination on the basis of sex in violation of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.834" offset="611806">In February 1968, Miss Evans the respondent here resigned upon marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.818" offset="635734">She claims that it was involuntary that she was forced to resign and since this arises on a motion to dismiss that is admitted for the purposes of this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.091" offset="672828">At the time of her discharge, Title VII provided that a charge claiming a violation of the Act had to be filed with Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within 90 days of the event.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.982" offset="720370">It's conceded that Miss Evans did not file such a charge within that time limit and in fact did nothing with respect to that for a period of four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.791" offset="755688">In February of 1972, she applied to United Air Lines for pre-employment as a Stewardess and in fact was hired as a new employee at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.097" offset="796857">She was sent to training school along with other new employees, finished the training a month later and in March 1972 was assigned to the line to assume the duties of a flight attendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.942" offset="840220">At that time as your court may know it had already been decided that the limitation of their position to members of the female sex only was a violation and the job had been opened up to males as well as females.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.240" offset="893406">She worked as a Stewardess as a flight attendant from March 1972 upon completion of training till February 1973 at which time she filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission in which she alleged that it a was violation of the act for United to have refused to credit her with seniority for her earlier employment which ended in the 1968, when they designed her seniority on rehire in 1972.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.126" offset="1117014">There is nothing in this record to the contrary.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Stuart Bernstein</label>
            <text syncTime="260.115" offset="1140942">That’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.886" offset="1144077">There is a period upon after termination which seniority is lost, discharge under these circumstances it's lost immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.188" offset="1181275">She received in due course the permission, the right to sue letter from the EEOC and suit was filed in September 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.066" offset="1208756">The United answered and I will allude to this later, in its answer, it admitted that the termination had been by resignation, but denied the allegation that had been involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.904" offset="1252119">It also added as affirmative defense at the time issue and then raised that by motion to dismiss.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.637" offset="1279077">The district court held that there was no continuing violation, that the act of the termination assuming to be discriminatory was completed long ago, the 90-day limit had run on that and that it was not continuing, consistent with decisions of this court and other courts, I don’t think that is an issue here as to whether or not a discharge is impleaded that not continuing and held that what she was really trying to do in this case was to reassert a claim which had been time bargaining mainly the 1968 termination of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.923" offset="1400181">Matter was appealed to the Court of Appeals and the interim the case Collins v. United Air lines have been decided in the Ninth Circuit where the Ninth Circuit held that a similarly situated former United Stewardess who applied for reinstatements after four years of unemployment, didn’t stay the claim against the company because there was continuing violation, held there was no obligation to rehire.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.004" offset="1496521">When the Seventh Circuit first was faced with Evans case on appeal, it determined consistent with the District Court that there was no cause of action, no continuing violation, action was based on the Time Barred Act and saw no difference between the situation before it because United had voluntarily rehired Ms. Evans than the situation in the Ninth Circuit were United had refused to reinstatement Mrs. Collins and so the result should be same in the event and dismissed and affirmed the dismissal by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.418" offset="1618147">It noted if the rule should be otherwise, employer such as United Airlines would have the temptation not to rehire employees who otherwise would be rehirable because you get into this upon doing so and the situation should not be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.952" offset="1680318">A petition for rehearing was filed and pending the determination on the ruling on the petition this Court issued its decision of Franks v. Bowman Transportation Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.233" offset="1725458">The Court of Appeals there upon granted the petition and on rehearing reversed itself without reference at all Collins for the problem that Time Barred first event and says that under Franks v. Bowman, the relief requested could be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.049" offset="1788674">Obliviously, Franks v. Bowman has some significance to our position here and I would like to discuss that briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.599" offset="1818872">Franks did not involve as this case did, the question of a time barred claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.854" offset="1835904">In Franks, the issue was whether the court having informed that there was a Discriminatory Act within the time limits by the way, that a permissible form of relief under Section 706(g) of the Civil Rights Act was to accord retroactive seniority and in that instance it would have been seniority from the date that the black Africans who have been discriminatorily refused employment as over the road drivers with Bowman Transport, when they were hired, they could get credit, seniority credit back to the time of first application.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.659" offset="1959097">In that case, the charge had been filed in February of 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.864" offset="1975920">The record in this case, the opinions themselves examine your opinion and the opinion in the Court of Appeals was clear that there were 200, it was a class action incidentally, there were 206 Africans concerned in that case, all who had applied for employment after January 1, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.500" offset="2050526">They are simply could not have been a time limit question in that case; none was ever raised in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.687" offset="2071215">What the Court held was -- that the fact that the 703(h) of the Civil Rights Act said that a bona fide seniority system itself could not be the basis of finding of a violation, did not preclude the granting as a element of remedy under 706(g) the remedial section to the Act retroactive seniority, but that would not stand in the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.857" offset="2179884">So, the Franks v. Bowman presupposed the proof of a Discriminatory Act within the time limit and concerned itself only with the application of remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.721" offset="2227322">The fact is there was a time limit problem in Franks, but that had been disposed off in the Court of Appeals and never reached this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.095" offset="2264834">Well, the Courts in Evans too, the Supreme Court interpreted that to me that the fact that a remedy was available, a retroactive seniority under 706(g) made United’s refusal or failure to accord seniority for the prior employment an offence under 703(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="561.823" offset="2347799">Now, United has never raised 703(h) as a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.730" offset="2359397">Its defense simply was you can’t prove a claim within the time limits provided by the Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.960" offset="2388341">We never get to the question of the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.438" offset="2394193">You don’t talk about remedy until you have proved the violation and none have been proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.404" offset="2414150">Well, the Court had made up the argument for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.819" offset="2419793">It said the United’s argument appears to rest substantial on 703(h) and the Supreme Court disposed of that in Franks.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.822" offset="2459812">I submit to you Your Honor that the holding of the Court of appeals on Franks and Evans too is misleading of Franks, nothing to do with the case whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.297" offset="2505683">In fact, the NAACP which has filed an amicus curiae brief in support of respondent concedes that.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.656" offset="2523133">That Franks was not a case involving time limits, it really does not reach the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.972" offset="2548419">We, therefore, submit that the Court of Appeals was simply in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.153" offset="2557092">We have a simple situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.881" offset="2563988">When act occurred, action was not taken within the prescribed time.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.013" offset="2584573">That act is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.068" offset="2588753">Though it was a pre-act violation, a post act violation on which such statute is run there is no different posture than a pre-act violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.792" offset="2619681">This is our basic position.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.068" offset="2628772">Now, there is one other line of cases that have been cited by counsel for respondents to support the position.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.695" offset="2655313">These are the so called departmental seniority cases typified by United Paper Workers in the Fifth Circuit Court and the District Court of Virginia which are the leading cases in this direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.643" offset="2695019">It may well be that those cases will stands from review.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.061" offset="2708707">After your honors have finish consideration of the TIME case and East Texas Motor Freight case which are now pending before you, where some challenges made through the departmental seniority cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.615" offset="2754996">But many of them, the departmental seniority cases have no application here because the theory there is that a freshly neutral seniority system is in fact discriminatory because it requires that seniority be exercised on the basis of seniority credits which employees were prohibited from gaining because of prior unlawful practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.102" offset="2840886">So, although it appears at that the black employees in the paper makers for example could bid into lines of progression formally held by white employees and whites could equally did it for black positions, yet no white would ever been in black position because they were the lower rated positions, lower paying positions and since you have to bid it on the basis of departmental seniority in order to move up into a higher paying job you have to sacrifice your just in seniority.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.542" offset="2938689">I think that’s an entirely different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.172" offset="2945167">The point there is that the courts have found that that seniority system is at that time a discriminatory act.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.268" offset="2977559">The system is discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.004" offset="2984455">Now, they say, there are some questions as to whether or not their position is viable, but however, this court may resolve the issues before in the over the road cases that you have under consideration doesn’t reach the point here.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.691" offset="3039208">Now, one way to bring this to a focus to show that inevitably respondent cannot prevail unless reliance is placed on the time-barred 1968 act, its look the way this matter arose, certainly at the state of the pleadings.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.127" offset="3093020">As I said, there was an allegation in the pleadings that the termination was involuntary and was forced by United Airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.982" offset="3120397">We have admitted only that there was a resignation.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.526" offset="3134607">It would not be an illegal act, not be of violation to act of any time and had an employee voluntarily resigned upon being married, will be no longer have the rule and many stewardesses and flight attendants still do resign upon getting married.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.081" offset="3184762">The percentage is not the same but it's certainly not rare, they are numbered in the hundreds.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.759" offset="3207541">There are still circumstances in which marriage, a woman who withdraws herself from the job market upon becoming married.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.134" offset="3229066">So, the mere fact that resignation wouldn’t be sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.851" offset="3239933">If this were to be sent back to the District Court for trial, since it stands on answer denying it, it would be incumbent upon the respondents to prove, in fact, that the resignation had been involuntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.290" offset="3285595">In other words, there in fact had been a violation of the act but that would require proof of a 1968 time-barred claim in order to sustain the position here.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.259" offset="3329481">Now, this brings us around to Machinists v. National Labor Relations Board, the decision arising under the National Labor Relations Act and there’s court seven Franks case itself, analogy to that statute are extremely helpful in applying the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="833.654" offset="3435120">You say there was no burden on the respondent here to demonstrate that the 1968 termination was involuntary by showing for example that upon her marriage, her supervisor came and said, of course you know, you got to resign and that could be the way you would show the involuntary in this way.</text>

            <text syncTime="903.796" offset="3715675">That’s correct Sir, but the point is not the burden as much as is that, that must be proved at that point and she must rely then on a 1968 Time Barred Act in order to assert the point that an application of a seniority system in 1972, she should have been given credit for that service which ended in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.129" offset="3796968">If I, may I would like to allude to the Machinists v National Labor Relations Board case.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.539" offset="3822673">That was in 1960 case and arose under 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act which is the analog of Section 703(d) of the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and in that it provides that charges be filed with the National Labor Relations Board within six months of the alleged unfair unlawful labor practice and under Title VII, it's the unlawful employment practice, again now a six month of period.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.210" offset="3965301">There the issue was what effect will be given to a pre 10(b), a pre-six month incident to cast light on an event occurring within the 10(b) period.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.942" offset="4008246">In that case, an illegal Union Security clause has been entered into through collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.476" offset="4034369">It was illegal because at that time the union did not represent a majority of the employees and in order to entered into it Union Security Clause, the Union must be the majority representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.183" offset="4073239">Contract was entered into and of course, since there was a Union Security Clause, employees had to joined the union, so that the very soon the union had a majority by operation of the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.670" offset="4107198">More than six months after, the execution of the contract, but within the period of it's enforcement, a charge was brought against the employer and Union alleging that this was an unlawful labor practice under the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.716" offset="4175326">The matter came before this court and it was held that since the contract on it's face was completely lawful, legal agreement and its illegality if any could only be established by proof of what had happened at the execution of the contract more than six months earlier, that such evidence was not admissible to prove the violation within the limitations period and the National Relations Board decision holding that in fact such evidence could be adduced was reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1050.964" offset="4304370">Now, we submit your honor, we have the same situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.157" offset="4313148">There is simply no way that a respondent can make out it's assertion here that United failed to credit her with seniority, earned up to 1968, in it's present application of it's neutral, nondiscriminatory time in the position seniority system which the company now has, unless that is proved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.529" offset="4402591">Because this respondent in 1972 was no different position than a new employee who had never worked for the company or an employee who had quit clearly on the voluntarily basis four years ago or an employee who had fired for cause or theft and then been rehired four years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.705" offset="4471345">In none of those instances, would it be suggested that employee was entitled or any of these employees were entitled any prior seniority and the only distinction you can make among those groups and the respondent here is that in fact that she worked for United up to 1968 and was terminated under this no marriage policy, a claim which is time barred.</text>

            <text syncTime="1124.557" offset="4598718">The case that the court did discuss the concept of a continuing violation in that case and it said that if in fact we were to follow the theory of the Board, the Labor Board in that instance the violation would never end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.188" offset="4649187">As here, respondent could have waited 20-30 years and come in and said well back in 1972, he gave me the seniority I was entitled to, and therefore, it's a continuing violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.354" offset="4685863">It went to that point as well as to the point as when did the initial event occurred which started the statute to run and they held that was the execution of the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1356.645" offset="5527110">By way of argument, Mrs. Evans’ case can be summarized in a nutshell as consisting of two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.335" offset="5553859">First that her charge was timely because it was filed during the pendency of the employment practice which she is challenging, namely United’s practice with respect to her seniority, whereby they deny her credit for any time worked before 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.934" offset="5616240">Secondly, that United’s practice with respect to her seniority is illegal because it gives present vitality to United’s past, open, admitted, across the Board pattern and practice discrimination of which Carolyn Evans is an identifiable victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.832" offset="5699832">The real issue in this case is not one of time limits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1416.881" offset="5767959">Her only affective avenue of relief would be by way of success in McDonald litigation as class member in McDonald.</text>

            <text syncTime="1626.755" offset="6607535">I think the best analogy I can give would be under the Wage and Hour Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.190" offset="6621223">If an employer says to a perspective applicant, I am not going to hire you because I can only afford to pay you $19 an hour and the employee says well that is 40 cents below the minimum wage and runs down to his nearest regional office of the US Department of Labor and files a claim, he is going to be tell the employment has no obligation to hire him.</text>

            <text syncTime="2422.963" offset="9792384">The Machinists case is clearly distinguishable from this one on three grounds; statutory policy, the statutory language and the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.545" offset="9830627">First let us take a look at the Machinists case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.171" offset="9841180">It was decided under the National Labor Relations Act in 1960 around the time of Steel Workers trilogy decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.464" offset="9870333">At that time, as Mr. Justice Harlyn expressly stated in his opinion, I refer to 362 U.S. 428.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.956" offset="9908263">The National Labor Relations Act was being viewed in the context of that case is primarily a regulatory statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.732" offset="9931459">The chief concern in that opinion was institutional stability in labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2464.101" offset="9956850">By contrast in the Evans’ case Title VII applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.007" offset="9972524">In 1964 and 1972 Congress reiterated the fact, as this Court Recognize in great (Inaudible) that the purpose of Title VII was remedial, (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.886" offset="10024037">Congress recognized that it would be upsetting the applecart.</text>

            <text syncTime="2504.412" offset="10118183">I think what we were discussing here though is a NLRA case which arose at a time in 1960 with the particular interpretation on Section 10(b) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.771" offset="10175548">I will agree that there are appropriate analogies with the National Labor Relations Act as this Court made clear in the Franks’ case, but the analogy does not apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.084" offset="10220792">The second distinction that I would make is on the statutory language, whereas the NLRA prohibits complaints issuing based upon acts occurring prior to the six-month period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.281" offset="10269588">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act does not use those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.929" offset="10284217">Title VII speaks in terms of challenging a practice occurring with 180 days, the challenged practice, but more importantly the legislative history is really to key difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.976" offset="10324341">As Mr. Justice Harlyn stated in the Machinists case 362 U.S. 426, Congress’ policy was to let sleeping, collective, bargaining contracts lie.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.148" offset="10369063">Congress specifically, Mr. Justice Harlyn said, specifically adverted to the problem of the contracts with minority unions, had previously taken pains to protect minority unions against belated attack and had enacted 10(b) with that purpose in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.056" offset="10432697">In Title VII by contrast, Congress has accepted the continuing violation theory, wrote in a two-year back pay limitation rule, has implicitly indicated with those two actions that there are cases when an employer’s past actions can be brought in to assess responsibility to assess liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.594" offset="10518901">Congress was explicitly concerned with seniority when it considered amendments for the 1970, for the Title VII in 1972 and Congress specifically approved the Paper Makers’ case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.062" offset="10568743">We believe it is clear from the legislative history the cases that Congress accepted at the time it acted prior to the 72 amendments that Congress intended to prohibit practices which in present operation perpetuate the effects of the past the discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2854.355" offset="11517928">I would also like to return to a point which was made by Mr. Bernstein regarding the Paper Makers’ case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.337" offset="11561814">Mr. Bernstein indicated that under Paper Makers there was a present discriminatory seniority policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.062" offset="11584697">I believe that an alternative wording or an alternative interpretation to that case is more suitable and correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.347" offset="11617925">That is that the Court in Paper Makers found that the seniority practices and issues were in fact facially neutral and arrived that the discriminatory nature thereof only by reference to past discrimination which was incorporated and in fact in that case plaintiffs did have to prove the existence of past discrimination, the past discrimination that was in hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.096" offset="11720847">I would suggest also that there are strong policy references for accepting the principle advanced by Ms. Evans here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.800" offset="11755642">If this court reverses the Evans decision, we feel that it maybe well nigh impossible in the future to attack the non-overt, non-obvious, subtle but pervasive practices in employment which do in fact extend discrimination into the present be it in a departmental seniority system, seniority practices and employment seniority system, a promotional system, possibly in the testing area as well because the only really effective way to get at subtle but pervasive discrimination is by looking at the roots of the practice, the historical background of the practice, how did it originate, what affect does it have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.874" offset="11939962">If we cannot look at that then I submit that the really pervasive form of discrimination in our society today maybe untouchable because the days of the overt and the obvious seems to be passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.244" offset="11989490">Seldom if ever or less often than before do we see explicit signs of discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2986.335" offset="12045810">Today the prevalent form of discrimination is subtle and we believe that the way to get at it is with the principle we have here and upholding of the Evans decision, far from opening a Pandora’s Box will keep open a necessary avenue of relief under Title VII.</text>

            <text syncTime="3052.140" offset="12309020">Well, what I am suggesting Mr. Chief Justice is that it is rare for an employer to rehire a past discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.153" offset="12337128">I am also suggesting that if it can be demonstrated that the employer’s action is in fact based upon past discrimination, but he does not rehire because the person is a past discriminatory that that would be closer to our case different from the Collins case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3085.020" offset="12440573">Mr. Chief Justice Burger, the point that you just made concerning the disincentive to hire was made by the Court of Appeals in Evans one, it seems to concern it very much, although it completely ignored it in Evans two.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.640" offset="12482996">The same point has disturbed the District Court in California last year in the case in which it attempted to reconcile, Collins and Evans and expressed some concern about that dichotomy now between these cases that it was perfectly alright not to rehire, but once you did, you ran into this host of problems that have been raised here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.372" offset="12549974">That was Kennan v. Pan-Am cited in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.388" offset="12566065">I wish to respond very briefly to some of the points made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.653" offset="12579126">We agree there can be a continuing violation, no question about that and we agree if there is a continuing violation that the statute now provides as a result of the 1972 amendments, that there can be a two-year period of back pay, but that two-year period is a limitation of liability, not a statute of limitations point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.959" offset="12656344">Up to that point, the limitations for back pay was drawn from the various state laws as it is now under Section 1981 of the earlier Civil Rights Act and it was to make uniform.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.515" offset="12698558">A back pay period that the 1972 amendments were passed, and Griggs is a good example of a continuing violation where the employer at the time of the litigation required a passage of a one Electic test and the maintenance of the high school diploma in order to progress into higher paying jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.471" offset="12778388">That was going on, the aborted attempt to justify that and this court said that it had a dispirit affect now and therefore was now a discriminatory even though facially neutral because the requirements for the test and the diploma were required of blacks as well as whites.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.982" offset="12840455">It was neutral than discriminate, the fact is that the blacks could more readily -- the whites could more readily meet the requirement than the blacks and was therefore held to be now a discrimination and a continuing discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.122" offset="12884968">That is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.072" offset="12892805">There is no contention here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.304" offset="12897716">There never has been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.598" offset="12902836">That the united seniority system which is based on date of hire is discriminatory in any way with respect to race, sex or any other matter, in fact I think that has been completely conceded all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.192" offset="12953304">United seniority system has not been challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.900" offset="12964067">The thesis stated in respondent’s brief on page 14 is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.637" offset="12987055">By relying on the 1968 termination, as creating a break in service and giving affect to that break in service in its current seniority practice with respect to Ms. Evans, United is actively enabling that prior discrimination to reach effectively into the present.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.738" offset="13051420">It says we are treating it as a break in service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3240.762" offset="13063541">Yes we are, we concede.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.629" offset="13070960">That is exactly what it was, it was a break in service and it would be a break in service for any employee, no matter how that break occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.316" offset="13101784">But the fact that we do not give credit for that break in service in 1972 does not create a present discriminatory act, as counsel insists, it is inevitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.583" offset="13138774">There is no way you can get to this point without relying on a time barred claim and United is sensitive to the problems of the civil rights movement as its counsel and I do not think it is incumbent upon us to defend ourselves here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.100" offset="13196870">We concede for the purposes of this case, that the no marriage rule was a violation, up until 1968 when we abandoned it and we concede that if Ms. Evans had filed the charge within 90 days of her termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.267" offset="13249533">She should have been back working long ago with full seniority and…</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3289.232" offset="13257370">Mr. Bernstein, but if you go to the trial in this case and suppose the respondent could show that another employee in the same position was discharged for theft and three years later it was found out that employee was not guilty of theft and was rehired and automatically given full seniority rights, that would put a damper on you, would it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="3356.570" offset="13526744">I am sorry, in this case I cannot go to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.329" offset="13541791">Let us suppose this Your Honor, let us suppose we had a system in which for all employees who voluntarily quit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.474" offset="13574392">We would permit them to return four years later and give them full seniority credit for past service, but we would not do the same thing for employees who had been terminated because of the “no marriage” rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.410" offset="13614098">I think you can make out a different case, but that is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.215" offset="13629353">You would say then our present practice, our present seniority system is discriminatory because it grants the seniority on a different basis to employees whose only differentiation is prior discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.693" offset="13675224">I would concede that is the kind of case that is typified by United Paper Makers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.203" offset="13697272">That is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.946" offset="13704273">If such a case exists I suggest the counsel bring a new cause of action against us, but that is not what has being tried here, that is not the issue at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.513" offset="13742516">A counsel says that the Machinists can be distinguished because of the historical context in which it arose, the congeniality for collective bargain agreements, the desire to stabilize labor relations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.993" offset="13796433">The fact is that in that case this court cited with approval an NLRB case Bowman by name, the citation of which is 113 NLRB 731, I have 1975 in my notes, but I am sure it was, must have been 1955 and cited with approval by the court in Machinists that was a seniority case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.321" offset="13881801">There an employee who had been on layoff, on return from layoff was given less seniority than he was entitled to under the collective bargaining agreement by some conspiracy between the union and the company because he had occupied the supervisory job in the meantime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.907" offset="13940106">So he was in a lower seniority slot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.592" offset="13950868">Well, six months after he came back, there was a layoff and because of his low seniority, relative low seniority because of what happened when he came on board, he was laid off earlier than he would have otherwise been and at that time he filed an unfair labor practice charge and the Board held it was time barred because the event that caused that situation occurred when they failed to give him the seniority to which he was entitled and there the same point was made that if otherwise this can go on for ten, 20 30 years indefinitely and you simply read Section 10 (b) out of the National Labor Relations Act, just as you had read out Section 706 (e) out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.936" offset="14116276">Your Honor, our thesis is a very simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.291" offset="14129650">There is no way that the case can be made out here without reliance on the time barred event and the statute limitations sort to of be mean anything then the Court of Appeals should be reversed in District Courts opinion, reinstated.</text>
