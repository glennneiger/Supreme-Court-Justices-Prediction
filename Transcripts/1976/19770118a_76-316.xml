            <label>Mr. William C. Canby, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="75.353" offset="405797">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.118" offset="424918">This case is about two lawyers who advertised in their local newspaper and were disciplined for it; but as I intend to show, it is also a case about the delivery of legal services in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.351" offset="477790">The question presented here is whether a disciplinary rule, Rule 2-101b of the Code of Professional Responsibility, which is embodied in a rule of the Arizona Supreme Court, violates the First Amendment or is invalid for conflict with the Federal antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.893" offset="563994">The rule itself prohibits any attorney from publicizing himself or his partner in local newspapers, among other things.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.602" offset="602760">It has set forth at Pages 3 and 4 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.588" offset="618747">The facts which gave rise to this controversy concern a very unusual law practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.758" offset="643406">Mr. Bates and Mr. O’Steen, by graduation from law school, worked for about a year-and-a-half, for the Maricopa County Legal Aid Society and then set out on their own to develop a very special kind of practice, which they intended to aim at that group of people who were above the poverty line and not eligible for legal services, but are below the level of affluence which the regular users at the legal profession enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.828" offset="783736">Consequently, they set up a firm, which was organized to do a business depending greatly on systems where the attorneys set up forms of their own design, used paralegals to a great extent, used automated equipment and, most important of all, charged very low profit for each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.916" offset="876105">As a result, we were able to offer a fairly narrow line of services which lent themselves to standardization; but they found a great deal of difficulty in getting the word out, and in the course of a two-year period, their practice did not thrive.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.127" offset="956876">They wanted to make it thrive and they wanted to produce the services and they wanted to have clients, so they put together an advertisement, which appears at Page 409 of the printed Appendix, and they run it in the Arizona Republic, a newspaper of general circulation in Phoenix, Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.683" offset="1035139">This advertisement, among other things, advertised uncontested divorce -- both spouses signed papers -- $175 plus a stated court filing fee; name change for a stated fee; uncontested adoptions and bankruptcies for stated fees; and an uncontested divorce where the attorneys would prepare all the papers for a person who was intent upon getting his own divorce himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.691" offset="1167109">This was published, and as a result of it, disciplinary proceedings were started by the State Bar of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.838" offset="1211726">Hearings were held and the Administrative Committee which first heard the case found that they had violated the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.606" offset="1246835">They permitted a full record to be made, but their finding was simply that the Rule of the Arizona Supreme Court had been breached by the publication and that the two appellants here should be suspended from practice for six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.264" offset="1317470">On appeal to the Board of Governors of the State Bar of Arizona, this was modified to a week’s suspension for each.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.993" offset="1344324">And when it went to the Supreme Court of Arizona, that was changed to a censure; but the finding that they had violated the canon was upheld and a censure was ordered by the Supreme Court of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.695" offset="1403152">The Supreme Court, in their opinion, specifically rejected the First Amendment claims and the antitrust claims which appellants here had asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.734" offset="1459367">Now, a restraint on this kind of advertising, of course, strikes appellants as a severe interference, a classic interference with the communication of information to their clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.349" offset="1521748">And as I say, their clients were ones who are perhaps the great middle mass, by and large, of the population.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="360.554" offset="1546616">You mean the files, Mr. Canby, or you mean the potential clients?</text>

            <text syncTime="367.228" offset="1573261">And I might add that an American Bar Foundation study, the Curran and Spalding study which is cited in our brief, indicates that one-third of all the adult Americans never use a lawyer in their lifetimes; another third do so once.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.475" offset="1642329">And it also indicates that a great number of people in the United States do not know how to find a lawyer, they do not have regular contacts with lawyers, and they also do not have a very good idea, many of them, of what lawyers charge for their services.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.896" offset="1700007">And in fact, a good portion of them tend to overestimate the cost of lawyer services.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="403.904" offset="1719965">Mr. Canby, you have emphasized the modest-means type of client.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.906" offset="1748072">The firm was also in the business of representing plaintiffs in personal-injury cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.400" offset="1770015">Did they draw any line with respect to the economic status of that type of client?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_c_canby_jr" startTime="424.258" stopTime="527.453">
            <label>Mr. William C. Canby, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="424.258" offset="1801467">No, Mr. Justice, and I hasten to add that they did not draw an economic line with any client.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.834" offset="1823723">The record indicates that the overwhelming majority of their clients range from the poverty level practically up to very few with incomes over $25,000 a year for a family.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.172" offset="1881088">But they do not have a policy of turning away people who have a greater income than that for any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.551" offset="1914629">The first contention which we assert here is that this provision violates the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.678" offset="1943155">And of course on a Commercial-Speech Doctrine, we rely very heavily on Bigelow v. Virginia, which upheld the First Amendment right to advertise an abortion service, and we also rely, of course, very heavily on the decision last term in Virginia State Board of Pharmacy, which held that there was a First Amendment Right for drug-price advertising, that case being brought by consumers who wanted to know drug prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.652" offset="2075021">But I submit that all of the elements which the Court found commanded First Amendment protection in Virginia State Board of Pharmacy are present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.332" offset="2113682">In other words, the great public interest in the economic allocation of resources, the importance of economic information, and particularly price information, to the consumer in making up his decision as to whether or not to avail himself of legal services and what attorney to get are served by the kind of ad that my clients ran.</text>

            <text syncTime="554.908" offset="2324020">In other words, if they gave ten recent recoveries that were very high, this, it seems to me, could be misleading if it gave a false idea of their practice, or it might even be argued that it overstates the role of the attorneys in getting those judgments.</text>

            <text syncTime="965.825" offset="3967645">The Governing Council of the American Medical Association this year held that physicians can advertise fees for specific services, and that ruling is set out in the Appendix to their amicus brief, the American Medical Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.711" offset="4039220">In other words, they did not see it as inconsistent with professionalism of the most discretionary sort to advertise a set fee for a set service and, in fact, set fees are even permitted by the American Bar Association.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.042" offset="4112572">In its 1975 amendments, it authorized attorneys to advertise in the classified pages that a written list of fees is available on request.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.890" offset="4171922">Well, if an attorney can make up a written list of fees and give it to people who see reference to it in an advertisement, I see no reason why that written list cannot simply be advertised and make the consumer have that information at much greater ease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.949" offset="4248200">But the set fee is still there and it has written down, and it has chosen by the attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.130" offset="4276935">On the side of the State in the First Amendment question, there is really here quite a burden to be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.462" offset="4314237">I think that Bigelow and the State Board of Pharmacy are clear that there is a very high State interest required that since the protection does extend to commercial speech, the First Amendment tilts in favor of publication and a State really ought to show interests which justify the prohibition of all of this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.898" offset="4407965">The first justification, which is heavily urged by the appellee in this case, is that this is really a form of barratry; that if advertisements are widespread, then people who would not have availed themselves of legal services will do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.211" offset="4465225">And if that is the definition of barratry, then we simply have to face that and say we are guilty, because ignorance is not a very good way to control who uses the legal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.402" offset="4517992">And to say that those who know they have causes of action or those who know they need wills or those who know they need divorces can get them, but those who do not know this cannot and that that is the way we control the flow of litigation or the use of legal services.</text>

            <text syncTime="1244.347" offset="5081819">I think the reason that these institutional efforts, although they are very helpful, really have not succeeded are two: one is that they do not permit enough information to be conveyed; and second, it is a limited effort, because it is really not directly in the economic interest of those disseminating the information to disseminate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.359" offset="5161859">And because of that, the efforts do not work as well as they do when the person who is disseminating has as personal interest in getting the message across.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.182" offset="5209088">Another argument that is used by the State, although I should say before I bring this one up that we are talking here about the State interests which might support this kind of a regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.294" offset="5261542">We are not talking about anything in this record, really, because the appellants were charged not with deceptive advertising or not with poor quality of services or anything else; they were charged with advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.790" offset="5319534">And the findings all along the way simply said they advertised, they are disciplined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.368" offset="5345865">So we are really simply anticipating arguments the State might make for a constitutional rule justifying this kind of an overbroad total ban, and we submit that its overbreadth itself is enough to strike it down.</text>

            <text syncTime="1679.805" offset="6823664">Well, the normal rule, I suppose, of this Court is that you decide statutory grounds and avoid constitutional decisions when possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.208" offset="6865251">I think that in this case, the First Amendment argument is admittedly simpler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.292" offset="6901614">And there certainly are occasions when this Court has decided a constitutional argument where there is a clear violation of the constitution without entering the statutory ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.153" offset="6949052">Incidentally, in the other drug-price case, Terry v. the State Board of Pharmacy out in California, the Three-Judge Court did just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.512" offset="6986459">There were both First Amendment and antitrust grounds set forth in that case; they decided the First Amendment ground -- this was before the Virginia State Board of Pharmacy case was decided here -- and then they said, "We simply won't reach the antitrust issues".</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.071" offset="7052706">The antitrust issues in this case, of course, revolve primarily around the State action, so-called exemption of Parker v. Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.566" offset="7094711">And here, the Justice Department, whose support we welcome on the First Amendment, takes leave of us and takes this position with some reluctance and I can understand their reluctance, because in the record in this case, for instance, other professions testified as to their practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.595" offset="7178825">The accountants, for instance, had a rule against competitive bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.646" offset="7195021">It was a rule of their national association, and it became a rule of their state association, and it became a rule of the State Board of Accountancy in Arizona: no competitive bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.117" offset="7244863">This was abandoned at the national level, according to the record, under threat of Justice Department action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.906" offset="7276001">It was abandoned at the State level by the State Board when our State Attorney General wrote an opinion to the Board that it violated State and Federal antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.810" offset="7319677">Other kinds of restraints are common.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.047" offset="7328559">The architects, for instance, who permit solicitation, permit solicitation, but not price competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.904" offset="7360010">Well, these are restraints of trade, and they are restraints of trade that regulated professions can easily get incorporated into rules of the profession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.755" offset="7399403">And the restraint is great, as it is in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.512" offset="7414450">The Parker v. Brown, of course, dealt with an anticompetitive raise and marketing scheme that was imposed by legislative command of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.392" offset="7461992">The evolution of Parker into which we believe this case can be fit is that announced in Cantor v. Detroit Edison, where this Court said the practice of furnishing free light bulbs by a regulated utility violated the antitrust laws, even though it was incorporated in a tariff which had been approved by the State Utilities Commission, and the utility was not free under State law to deviate from that practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.677" offset="7591142">Now, in Cantor, the Cantor case, of course, is distinguishable, in that the State was not the one which was doing the enforcing; it was a suit against a private utility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.695" offset="7651224">Here, we are taking the next step basically and trying to prevent the enforcement of a restrictive trade practice which the State has approved by adopting this rule, which was clearly originated by the ABA, both its predecessor and the present one, and adopting it into a rule of the State Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.845" offset="7747772">The language which, it seems to me, the Government is overlooking in Cantor is that which deals with the fact -- and this was dealt with also in Goldfarb -- that whether or not the State is involved there is a threshold question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.332" offset="7821751">And if the State is not involved, as this Court really did not feel it was in Goldfarb, then there is no immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.168" offset="7849023">But that is the threshold question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.914" offset="7856024">Of course, the State is involved here, the court is enforcing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.722" offset="7871279">Well, then, what question comes after the threshold, and that is, is this rule really necessary to make the regulatory system work?</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.104" offset="7912761">How badly does it interfere with the system of free competition that the Sherman Act has mandated?</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.740" offset="7947348">And what interests of the State make this rule necessary, and what ones do not?</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.845" offset="7971798">And in this case, we submit that the same interests which we find to be weak when they are measured as a First Amendment part of the State’s balance are equally weak when they are measured in the antitrust balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.075" offset="8032716">There is no question here, of course, that this is a restraint, and that is the restraint of price advertising affects the price structure, a more or less classic antitrust restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1993.281" offset="8077542">The fact that the State is enforcing it is not the whole answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.750" offset="8111397">For instance, the State was enforcing its own rule basically, or at least a State command was involved, in the Schwegman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.666" offset="8159044">The Schwegman case was an attempt basically to invalidate the state non-signer law under the fair-trade acts, and it succeeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.557" offset="8190600">The State command was invalid, because it conflicted with the command of the Sherman Act; in other words, that fair-trade practice did not fall within an exemption to the Sherman Act that Congress had created.</text>

            <text syncTime="2358.096" offset="9536742">Mr. Friedman, before you commence, let me share with you at least my primary concern of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.717" offset="9575299">I think all lawyers agree that the problem being discussed here today is a very serious one, important for the public and the profession, and the delivery of legal services in our country obviously is defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.092" offset="9632768">The problem that I think concerns all of us on this bench and at the Bar is what to do about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.293" offset="9665578">Lawyers have advertised to some extent always.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.558" offset="9682610">Anybody who knows about Martindale can find out where lawyers went to school, how old they are and, until recently at least, who their clients were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2405.456" offset="9726182">They can also find in what areas of specialization lawyers are professed to be competent in their practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.794" offset="9767560">I hope you will have time to address not just the barebones issue of whether or not there can be any advertising, I do not perceive that as the basic issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.519" offset="9810505">The question is what limits rationally, fairly, constitutionally may be imposed; who imposes those limits, and how are they enforced?</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.730" offset="9867348">These are the broader contours of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.786" offset="9875498">We could decide this case and may very well do it in a very narrow way, but that would not advance the resolution of the fundamental problem.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_m_friedman" startTime="2451.544" stopTime="2631.745">
            <label>Mr. Daniel M. Friedman</label>
            <text syncTime="2451.544" offset="9910606">Well, let me address myself directly to that question, Mr. Justice Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.659" offset="9935057">I think we start with the basic issue that has been suggested in this case is a narrow one, whether there can be an absolute ban on all advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.596" offset="9970792">And the position of the United States is that this absolute ban imposed by the State of Arizona goes beyond the permissible limits of the First Amendment; it is inconsistent with the First Amendment because of the strong interest in members of the public in getting information about legal services, both their availability and their cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.114" offset="10056892">Now, we also, of course, recognize there is a very strong interest in ensuring high ethical standards at the Bar, as this Court has indicated, both because of the critical role that lawyers play in the administration of justice and their role as officers of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.513" offset="10130453">Obviously, lawyers do not stand in exactly the same position as the average merchant who is selling a standardized product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.149" offset="10165039">He is selling a special service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2518.800" offset="10179563">But we think that the First Amendment requires that any restraints that the State does impose upon the dissemination of information by lawyers to the public as potential clients cannot go beyond what is necessary adequately to protect the State’s interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.797" offset="10279560">Now, that ultimate balancing in First Amendment cases has to be done by the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.252" offset="10305369">Of course, the State has the power to prevent misleading and deceptive, false advertising by lawyers; and the State has a broader authority than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.852" offset="10351762">There may be many things that a merchant can do that it is not proper for a lawyer to do, because it is important to this country that the people of this country have a high regard for the legal profession because of its critical role in the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2580.743" offset="10427413">But we do not think that because of the importance that the lawyers play in the legal system and in the operation of our country that this means the Bar can say there can be no advertising at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.223" offset="10489271">We do not think the Bar can go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.298" offset="10497630">Now, there are problems, of course, of policing these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.911" offset="10516020">And I might just add in passing that we have indicated in our brief that there are some recent indications of suggestions of what would be permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.803" offset="10555622">We are not espousing any of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.499" offset="10562414">All that we cite these for is to point out that the problem is not to us an all-or-nothing problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.290" offset="10593552">It is not either there can be no advertising or that there is got to be enormous discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.227" offset="10617271">There have to be some limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.348" offset="10625839">Now, one of the problems --</text>

            <text syncTime="2634.648" offset="10642975">I think we start from the premise that some advertising already is permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.338" offset="10661784">So the total ban issue as I perceive it is not here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2650.535" offset="10706505">But Mr. Canby stated quite explicitly that he thought the First Amendment entitled lawyers to talk about the quality of their services.</text>

            <text syncTime="2663.351" offset="10757810">Well, that, it seems to me again, would depend on what is said.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.969" offset="10780275">If statements with respect to the quality of services are misleading, the State can prohibit them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.670" offset="10811099">I do not think a lawyer could publish an ad saying, “Come to me, I am a better lawyer than anyone else in town”.</text>

            <text syncTime="3462.800" offset="13955615">And I think they could also state that on Saturdays, a special for the man who is working five days a week and cannot come to see us during the week, $14.95, I think they could say that as long as it is truthful.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.528" offset="14006502">If, in fact, when people came in for their $25 wills or their $14.95 wills, they quickly told them, “Well, your will is much more complicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.353" offset="14157803">It seems to us that what the cases in this Court starting with Parker v. Brown and going through Cantor have established is one fundamental principle, that if the action challenges a violation of the antitrust laws is, in fact, action of the State or compelled by the State, it is a State action not subject to the strictures of the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.802" offset="14243589">Now, in this case, unlike the Virginia case where all that happened with regard to the fee schedules was that the State approved them or suggested them or authorized them, here, the State commands it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.608" offset="14298864">It is a rule of the State Supreme Court of Arizona, and if I may just complete this, Mr. Chief Justice, the State Supreme Court is the one that exercises the function of the State of Arizona in dealing with lawyer discipline.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.066" offset="14384650">This is not a case where the Bar Association suggests something and the State Supreme Court says, “If you want to do it, go ahead and do it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.443" offset="14418192">Here, as has been brought out, it is the State Supreme Court, the final arbiter on these matters, that has ordered the lawyers in Arizona not to advertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.955" offset="14460197">It is the State Supreme Court that has disciplined these lawyers for advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.417" offset="14482035">The State is speaking in this matter through the only agency by which it functions with respect to disciplining of lawyers and that, it seems to us, is State action under any standard of the term and is therefore not a violation of the Sherman Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3633.069" offset="14636680">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3637.513" offset="14654443">From Mr. Canby and the amici and the Government, I draw a certain common syllogism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.222" offset="14693313">The major premise is that not enough people receive legal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.953" offset="14720167">The minor premise is that solicitation by advertising will greatly aid the deprived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.443" offset="14754126">The conclusion is that the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution requires that advertising be permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3671.060" offset="14788608">In response to this, my own single greatest obligation from all of the sources on which we have drawn is to Mr. Frederick Ballard of the Bar of this city, who almost, Mr. Justice Powell, in response to your comment, in making a speech of his own on this subject directed me to a singularly opposite aphorism by H.L. Mencken, which I repeat: "For every serious problem, there is a solution which is simple, direct and wrong."</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.218" offset="14941268">While we acknowledge the sincerity of those who with Biblical fervor contemplate the vision of striking the rock and having a stream of pure water come out to slightly first of the multitude, we frankly find it astonishing that they can be so blind to the cataclysmic flood which they seek to unleash.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.527" offset="15038548">What you are asked to believe is that if you give your permission, the nation will be dotted with noble souls who will, by advertising, communicate to those otherwise unaware their desire to perform worthwhile and needed service at very low costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.582" offset="15114721">This frankly visionary speculation overlooks the human experience, which tells us that you would be unleashing quite a different flood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.915" offset="15160069">The plain truth of the matter is that advertising law business leads to incompetence, at best.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.967" offset="15192252">In the experience of the Patent Office, which tried it and after full hearings concluded in formal opinion that this was exactly true, is good documentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.537" offset="15238541">But to put it bluntly, it leads to lying, cheating and swindling at its worst.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.695" offset="15259126">We do not have to guess about this; we know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.371" offset="15273859">We know because, as Justice Stewart reminded us this morning, there was no limitation on advertising in the 19th Century, and what I am talking about is exactly what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3805.239" offset="15325372">The only notes we have of an oral argument that was ever made by Abraham Lincoln at the trial court involved a case of the widow of a Revolutionary War veteran who was represented by what was then called a claims agent, who was permitted to get his business by solicitation, and he was doing what within our own time would be regarded as legal work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3829.238" offset="15421398">Lincoln took the widow’s case without charge to try to recover some of what that agent had kept.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.925" offset="15452118">And perhaps some of you have seen the notes of that argument and can imagine the immense force of the underlying phrase at the end of it, which says, “Skin the defendant”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.908" offset="15511991">It is not any wonder that Lincoln told the law students, “Never stir up litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3860.451" offset="15546159">A worse man can scarcely be found than one who does this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3865.777" offset="15567475">A moral tone ought to be infused into the profession which would drive such men out of it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.270" offset="15601434">Now, I want to make very clear that for those of us who oppose a ban on solicitation, we do not regard this as the pieties of the dead to which we are somehow paying lip service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3889.216" offset="15661307">The other side says in its brief that what a different era called runners and cappers are quite anachronisms which do not need to concern us any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.544" offset="15702580">We do not see it that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.400" offset="15713970">We say that the lawyer who directly or true his intermediary goes to the hospital to line up the injured to sue is unworthy of the profession and, in Mr. Lincoln’s phrase, “ought to be driven out of it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3915.193" offset="15765170">Mr. Canby says that he would like to seek controls on that score, but his client said at trial in response to the question: “Do you believe you have the same First Amendment right to go to the hospital or give your cards at the scene of the accident?” was, after some waffling, "I think that it may well be true that if tested, a lawyer has a constitutional right to engage in that solicitation".</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.737" offset="15871331">No lawyer of integrity -- I put it this strongly -- no lawyer of integrity can read our recitation of what actually happens with actual solicitation -- we took the cases from California as an example -- frankly without his stomach turning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.070" offset="15936637">Even when our guard is all the way up, there are persons who solicit the widow and the orphan and the sick to bring actions which are, first and foremost, intended to line the pockets of those who represent them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3974.478" offset="16002257">We say that this is absolutely bad business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.344" offset="16017721">We take as our contemporary champion Chief Justice Roger Traynor, who wisely said, speaking of the very persons that our friends here wish to help, the persons who are inexperienced, who do not know about legal council, who are having their first run up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3995.627" offset="16086894">What Chief Justice Traynor said was, “Clients who need legal assistance only rarely, and are therefore inexperienced in selecting counsel, may be induced by advertisement to select unsuitable counsel, with consequent injury not only to themselves, but to the reputation to the Bar as a whole".</text>
            <text syncTime="4019.372" offset="16181875">Now, the argument which you heard this morning, the counterargument is that all these evils can be avoided by permitting only honest advertising and by controlling the deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4032.589" offset="16234747">If there is one element of sanctimonious pap in this whole case, that is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.402" offset="16265989">The argument fails for three reasons: first, advertising to be gravely undesirable does not have to be misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.267" offset="16301516">There were examples mentioned this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4051.886" offset="16311965">Exuberant puffing of the raps beaten here or the six $100,000 verdicts last year may be true without being very desirable; second, the hustle is peculiarly likely to push people where they should not go when there is no real likelihood that they can appraise their own situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.839" offset="16403707">This is a matter to which I want to return; the third, and the main point I would develop now, the whole talk of controlling misleading advertising by criminal or regulatory sanctions is itself the biggest hoax, the biggest misleading of all.</text>
            <text syncTime="4095.661" offset="16487090">The plain truth is -- and I direct myself, Justice Marshall, to the exchange you had about, are we talking only about absolute control -- what we are talking about is a prohibition of legal advertising in newspapers, in this case by people who are trying to make money out of them, and that is prohibited in our state.</text>
            <text syncTime="4115.506" offset="16566397">And I point this out, that in all of the briefs you have had -- Mr. Canby, the Government and the rest of them -- no one has ever yet told you how these controls are supposed to function.</text>
            <text syncTime="4129.446" offset="16622195">No one gives you more than an amenable invocation of honesty.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.328" offset="16641735">The granddaddy of all false professional advertising, of course, is medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="4139.858" offset="16663782">The spellbinding patent-medicine vendor with his snake-oil cures is a 19th Century legend, which we allow to become amusing because it is so remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4150.247" offset="16705369">We have created a Food and Drug Administration which works in a kind of a way, sluggishly and expensively, to control the abuses of the national drug concerns, few in number, which manufacture the bulk of the products you spoke about in the prescription-drug case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4170.469" offset="16786244">But the only protection the public gets from misleading advertising at the grassroots level is the ethical system of the doctors themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="4182.053" offset="16832637">I level a direct challenge to our adversaries here: if you allow a general pattern of advertising -- and what you do here for lawyers you are going to do for accountants and for doctors; they are in the same pot -- if you allow this, just exactly who is going to look at the hundreds of thousands of ads which may come out?</text>
            <text syncTime="4203.299" offset="16917588">Who is to appraise whether they are misleading?</text>
            <text syncTime="4205.719" offset="16927305">Who is to do anything about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="4207.650" offset="16935037">The institutions do not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.988" offset="16944337">There is no procedure, no structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.504" offset="16954368">All we are doing is opening the gate and saying, “Let her come”.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.960" offset="16972236">Now, Justice Rehnquist, you raised in colloquy the argument of overbreadth, which Justice Canby talked about, the argument that the ban is too broad.</text>
            <text syncTime="4228.723" offset="17019256">Chief Justice Hughes, than whom no more towering debatteur of free speech ever sat here, told us in a similar case that society did not need to pick and choose which professional ads are invidious and which are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.954" offset="17096161">This Court in the recent Mini Theatres' case observed that in commercial speech, the content of a particular advertisement may determine the extent of its protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="4260.208" offset="17145271">Chief Justice Hughes had something to say about content.</text>
            <text syncTime="4263.798" offset="17159586">He told us that professional advertising is what it is: inherently misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="4271.377" offset="17189888">He expressly rejected the concept that control of professional-service advertising must be as narrow as possible to fit only precise abuses.</text>

            <text syncTime="4291.162" offset="17269091">I would like to be specific about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4292.695" offset="17275152">The Supreme Court of Arizona pointed out instances in which even this ad, which is a little squib of an ad meant to be a test case and they make it as perfect as they can; so they tell us first of all that this was a legal clinic, and they somehow imply that there is something virtue or cheaper about it, virtuous or inexpensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4310.136" offset="17344951">But when we cross-examine them on the stand, there is no conception of what a legal clinic is; it is a meaningless term, simply a kind of an invocation of nothingness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4319.903" offset="17384030">More than that, they are offering particularly economical services, particularly beneficial prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="4329.525" offset="17422482">Take, for example, the one of their consent divorces.</text>
            <text syncTime="4333.898" offset="17440037">They have also told us on this record that they charge $40 an hour for their time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4338.545" offset="17458531">They have told us on this record that their divorces take between an hour-and-a-half and three hours' maximum.</text>
            <text syncTime="4344.062" offset="17480683">And it is no wonder that the Supreme Court of Arizona observed that this is outright misleading on its face, this indication of some great bargain for these so-called consent divorces.</text>
            <text syncTime="4356.975" offset="17532301">The one on which there is the greatest tone of misleading, a matter to which I may come back, is to talk about name changes, and that also was picked up by the Supreme Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="4368.354" offset="17577859">The truth of the matter is that anybody in our town who wants to can go and get his name changed for nothing, and you do not need legal services for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4378.026" offset="17616520">So the question of whether somehow this is a great benefaction to mankind is highly doubtful.</text>

            <text syncTime="4981.940" offset="20032115">I want to make clear that we are no more regressive than our friends about the problem raised by Justice Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="4988.109" offset="20056879">Of course we have to do the best we can to extend legal services in the United States; and we have to do a better job than we are doing and we are trying, and that is one of the ways we try.</text>
            <text syncTime="4998.722" offset="20099302">But the bludgeon of the First Amendment, the main point of the colloquy this morning with Justice Stewart, it is simply not a suitable tool or device for doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5009.313" offset="20141620">Let me turn, if I may, to the concept of commercial speech as being balanced against the community values of the control of that speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="5024.596" offset="20202747">My own syllogism, unlike the other side's, is, the legal profession is worth preserving.</text>
            <text syncTime="5030.555" offset="20226570">Its good vastly outweighs its evils; the minor premise is that commercialization is incompatible with professionalism; and the conclusion is, therefore, the profession should avoid commercialization.</text>
            <text syncTime="5046.911" offset="20292086">Now, I know I have to defend that syllogism against hard attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="5050.436" offset="20306192">We all know that law offices are big businesses, that they may have billion-dollar or million-dollar clients, they are run with computers and all the rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5059.637" offset="20342972">And so the argument may be made that to term them “noncommercial” is sanctimonious humbug.</text>
            <text syncTime="5066.456" offset="20370244">But my response, developed more fully in my brief than I can here, is very much the response that Plato made to the same argument 2,000 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="5079.776" offset="20423534">Plato, in his dialogue with Thrasymachus in The Republic, makes two points which have some real bearing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5087.842" offset="20455717">His first point is that because of the degree of special knowledge involved, the professional on the one hand and his client on the other are, as he saw it, “almost like the ruler and his subject” were the fancy words he used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5104.806" offset="20523635">In everyday terms, this means that the professional diagnosis, the problem, and he makes his recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5115.404" offset="20566058">While the client has some choice of rejection or selection of alternative courses of action, he is basically dependent on the advice he receives.</text>
            <text syncTime="5125.079" offset="20604719">In short, Plato saw a profound difference between buying a pot and obtaining a remedy for a disease, just as there is a profound difference between going to the drugstore and getting a bottle of standard-produced pills and going to the doctor and finding out what one ought to do for his illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="5144.206" offset="20681206">Now, this, we developed again extensively in the brief before you, is developed by the sociologists as a recognition that this condition still exists, and it puts very serious problems of social control.</text>
            <text syncTime="5162.299" offset="20753617">The plain truth is that laymen cannot judge a professional performance in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5170.267" offset="20785486">Indeed, they may not even be able to set the goals for the professional’s work, and this means that the two most common forms of control of work in industrial societies, either bureaucratic supervision or customer judgment, are of only limited applicability to the professions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5194.284" offset="20881512">At the same time there is a need for social control, and so we come to the ultimate question: who is going to exercise it?</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.175" offset="20921114">Our adversaries wish it to be exercised by the policemen or a legal equivalent of the Food and Drug Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="5212.185" offset="20953088">We want it exercised by the courts, taking such help as they need from the professions.</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.909" offset="20984017">Now, Plato makes another point which is serious here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5223.188" offset="20997183">I go into this because if we are talking about professionalism and what this is going to do to the profession, then we need to know what a profession is and what this one is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.314" offset="21029679">Plato says, “Is the physician a healer of the sick or a maker of money?”</text>
            <text syncTime="5237.417" offset="21054025">And his answer is that no true professional considers his own good in what he describes, but rather the good of his patient, because the true professional is not a mere moneymaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="5253.712" offset="21119227">And this leads to the related concept of the professional and service, and that has lived with us for 2,000 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="5263.411" offset="21157992">Roscoe Pound was no high priest of sanctimony, and he gave us a firm reminder of the professional who performs service for little or nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="5273.557" offset="21198639">He says, “The spirit of public service in which the profession of law is or ought to be exercised is the prerequisite of sound administration of justice according to law".</text>
            <text syncTime="5287.809" offset="21255586">This, I submit, is a key difference between commercialization and professionalism.</text>

            <text syncTime="5513.294" offset="22157542">Part of the privilege of that status of being a lawyer and an officer of the court is a meaningful set of duties which go with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5521.479" offset="22190352">We are talking about one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5523.759" offset="22199442">More than 100 years ago, the English jurist A.V.

            <text syncTime="5547.286" offset="22293588">What I am saying is that being a professional means taking your place in a whole network of privileges and duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="5555.831" offset="22327756">As this Court said in Cohen v. Hurley -- it was overruled later; but on this point, this quote, the majority quoted it and the minority adopted it, and what you said goes to those duties: "It is certainly not beyond the realm of permissible State concern to conclude that too much attention to the business of getting clients may be incompatible with a sufficient devotion to the duties which a lawyer has to the Court".</text>
            <text syncTime="5585.499" offset="22446352">I have spoken of the direct damage to the public, the kind of thing Chief Justice Traynor was talking about, in letting the snake-oil peddlers loosen the legal profession.</text>

            <text syncTime="5787.276" offset="23253535">Now, with the experimentation, it may go further; but what we are really pleading for is, in the desire to solve this problem, let us not destroy the substance of the shared professionalism which we have built up; and I do not apologize for being classical on this score, Mr. Justice Marshall, because we are dealing with a professional tradition of hundreds and hundreds of years.</text>

            <text syncTime="5856.745" offset="23531374">It is a different day and age; but it is an age in which professional tradition has a contribution still to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="5867.206" offset="23573170">Let me, if I may, conclude on a note of unabashed sentiment. I will not refer to the antitrust subject, merely because it is fully briefed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5877.067" offset="23612667">I sit here with my partner, Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5879.453" offset="23622175">He has just celebrated his 74th birthday.</text>
            <text syncTime="5883.742" offset="23639416">His father, with whom he once practiced, was a territorial judge in our state, and the roots of his practice extended back to the 19th Century.</text>
            <text syncTime="5893.623" offset="23678913">My own father died 40 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="5896.024" offset="23688526">He or I have been members of the Bar of Wisconsin almost for all of this century, my native state.</text>
            <text syncTime="5903.568" offset="23718619">We have with us today a young lady who assists us as the new breed of legal assistant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5909.741" offset="23743384">Because of her age, she probably will be linked with the law until the millennium.</text>
            <text syncTime="5915.812" offset="23767625">The point is that just in this one case on this one side, the professional ties represent 100 consecutive years in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5925.933" offset="23808167">We know the weaknesses of this profession, its limitations and its failures.</text>
            <text syncTime="5932.579" offset="23834708">So, obviously, do the members of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5937.211" offset="23853202">We also, all of us, the few at this table, this Court, the lawyers in this room, the thousands outside, and those who came before us, have taken pride in being associated with what is good about this profession; pride in being associated with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5957.701" offset="23935227">Minor figures we as individuals may be, but our line runs to Cicero and to Marshall and to Hughes, and we, too, hope that we serve in our small ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="5974.178" offset="24001160">May it never be said that this profession was cheapened here in this, its highest sanctuary.</text>

            <text syncTime="5992.072" offset="24072735">Mr. Chief Justice, just two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="5997.485" offset="24094365">The material where the name change is discussed appears on Pages 111 and 113 of the record, where Mr. O’Steen is asked whether a lawyer is needed at all with a client.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="6013.427" offset="24158104">What page?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_c_canby_jr" startTime="6014.346" stopTime="6154.492">
            <label>Mr. William C. Canby, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="6014.346" offset="24161761">Well, 111 of the record, and I am going on to 113.</text>
            <text syncTime="6017.664" offset="24175031">I will paraphrase; I will not read this.</text>
            <text syncTime="6020.556" offset="24186629">And he said, “Well, no, except when it can be done by administrative procedure, going to a department or something, then we send the client on his way with instructions how to do it”.</text>
            <text syncTime="6033.992" offset="24240337">Then the next question is, “Yes, but nothing in the law requires a person who is getting a judicial name change to go to a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="6041.853" offset="24271788">Three out of ten in this county go to the court, go to the clerk and do it themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="6049.875" offset="24303867">What do you say, then, to that?</text>
            <text syncTime="6051.482" offset="24310345">The answer was, “Well, we do not know how well it has done, we do not know where instructions exist for this kind of thing; but we do not feel that we have to advise the people that they could do it themselves.”</text>
            <text syncTime="6066.048" offset="24368546">Now, the final answer to this, of course, is that it does not have anything to do with the ad itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6072.163" offset="24392997">If the Bar wants to make a general rule that every attorney should advise every client that all litigants are entitled to handle their matters themselves, then I think that is perfectly proper and all lawyers can be instructed to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6083.686" offset="24439181">But it does not go to the question of what has been advertised in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="6087.902" offset="24456004">The ad itself offers a service, and it is not deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="6091.562" offset="24470632">The other point that I would like to make has to do with the comment that the court below found the charge misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="6102.013" offset="24512428">The only mention about the expense of a divorce in the lower court’s opinion, the Supreme Court of Arizona’s opinion, is on 12A of our Jurisdictional Statement, which is that blue that is in the Appendix, and it says, “Mr. Justice Gordon, concurring separately, says, ‘Moreover, I am able to foresee instances in which the $175 fee quoted for this service would be unreasonably high.’”</text>
            <text syncTime="6129.461">My clients, in addition to the hours they put in, the brief hours on a divorce, have put in, as the record shows, many, many hours devising systems so that they can handle it this briefly, and they also use paralegal time.</text>
            <text syncTime="6142.598">If divorces can be had more cheaply than this, let another attorney advertise that fact, and the public will be even better served than they are by my clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="6153.351">Thank you.</text>
