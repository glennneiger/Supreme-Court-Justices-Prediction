            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100545">We will hear arguments next in 76-357, Linmark Associates against The Township of Willingboro.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.673" offset="243174">Mr. Hauch, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_p_hauch-_jr" startTime="38.871" stopTime="443.512">
            <label>Mr. John P. Hauch</label>
            <text syncTime="38.871" offset="256026">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.196" offset="269296">In this case, the petitioners are contending the designed ordinance of the Township of Willingboro which prohibits ‘For Sale’ signs in residential premises is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.717" offset="315376">Right now, if you live in Willingboro, and you desire to sell your home, you may not post a ‘For Sale’ sign on your property.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.189" offset="345260">If you desire to engage a builder to aid you in selling your home, how do you ignore if the order you can post it for sale sign on your property.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.282" offset="385593">The justification offered by the township is not the ‘For Sale’ signs are improper, the justification is that the Township Council has a fear that the residents of the community, in the neighborhood will develop what is called a psychological fear, this being by seeing homes for sale in your neighborhood, you get the message that people are moving out and in turn, this might lead to an irrational reaction on the part of the neighbors and they might rush to put their homes in market and rush to leave the town.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.423" offset="542223">Now, mixed in, with this justification is the thought on the part of some people that some neighbors may feel that if this person moves out, an member of the racial minority may move in.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.697" offset="615262">So, the justification primarily is based on a frame of apprehension and fear, yet the ordinance bans all ‘For Sale’ signs on residence in Willingboro.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.092" offset="664894">We can see a number of examples, where the ban would be totally irrational to accomplish and of keeping fear from residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.863" offset="699898">For example, the person that is transferred in their employment from Willingboro, for instance, New Jersey to California cannot put up a sign, ‘Home For Sale, transfer, have Black in the community, who is selling may not put up a sign, House For Sale, Black moving out, that certainly would not create the fear that the township envisions is present for sale signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.768" offset="803552">Similarly, a person living from one side of town to the other and this is not a small town, it's a town of 11,000 houses could not put up a sign, ‘House for Sale moving across town but not out of town’.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.557" offset="858723">And the basis that the township has established here, I think leads to the central issue in the case and that is whether the township can carry its heavy burden of sustaining that this ordinance is constitutional and does not abridge the freedom of speech of the First Amendment and getting to this posture of the case, the Court Of Appeals by two to one decision reverse the District Court, the Court of Appeals holding that the ordinance was constitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.994" offset="996441">At that time in the history of development of the Protection for The Commercial Speech, the Court of appeals only had the initial case of 1942 of Valentine against Christians.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.644" offset="1051089">It had subsequently the Pittsburg press case, which upheld a prohibition on the advertising of an illegal activity, namely the sex discrimination and employment were prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.192" offset="1109289">It also had this court’s decision in Bigelow against Virginia but did not think that the Bigelow decision extended far enough to prevent the township from having such an ordinance ban on signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.420" offset="1174178">In 1976, after the Court of Appeals decision, this court handed down its opinion and the Virginia State Board of Pharmacy case.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.083" offset="1212839">This was a notable announcement of free protection afforded to commercial speech because among other things and probably primary as far as society is concerned, it was recognized that there is a great public interest in having the free flow of commercial information, it maybe indispensable and that people and their ordinary individual commercial transactions should be able to make not only intelligent but well informed decisions, they should not be kept ignorant of facts, they should not be pushed by other means to get facts that are not more readily available by the message thought to be put.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.591" offset="1398831">The analogy with the Virginia State Board Of Pharmacy case, I think is extremely close to our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.686" offset="1423281">There, there was a private economic transaction and was a case of extended commercial advertising protection to a product, the first case in that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.737" offset="1467481">It is essential obviously that price which was consideration in the Virginia pharmacy case, was something that had to be known by the purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.170" offset="1513143">In our case, the supply of a product or a house, the availability of it in the market is equally essential to the informed and intelligent choice of a buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.816" offset="1559745">The Virginia pharmacy case extended the protection of the First Amendment not only for the benefit of the advertise but also for the benefit of the person receiving the advertisement so that he could be informed and make intelligent decisions that affect his daily life and the sale of a house is a vitally important thing to most home owners, it may be their most important asset.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.747" offset="1663503">Now, the situation is not that we claim, signs cannot be regulated of this nature, obviously, there are clear areas for regulation, namely signs cannot be false, they cannot be deceptive, they cannot advertise an illegal activity as indicated by the Pittsburg press case.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.366" offset="1753992">There maybe other areas of regulations, such as for safety and for health.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.718" offset="1771337">None of these areas were involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.141" offset="1781054">Township comes forth with no justification on any of those basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.430" offset="1802161">There also is not an ordinance framed in maintaining in the community, something for the purposes of safety such as traffic ingestion or something that is obnoxious and blaring that offends the senses such as noise.</text>

            <text syncTime="443.512" offset="1874573">What could be your view if an ordinance prohibited placing any sign on the property at any time for any reason.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.186" offset="1913234">I would say, this unconstitutional, if Your Honor, please, if I may give an example, I think the forbidding, a political sign, for instance, no matter how small could be regulated, I think it would be unconstitutional to prohibit a political sign on a private property.</text>

            <label>Mr. John P. Hauch</label>
            <text syncTime="477.267" offset="2009574">I think the typical billboard sign, if it's not compatible with the area in which it is displayed, such as national beautification of highways –</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="484.131" offset="2037054">This is matter of fear that the time and place regulations can be made of some public display.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_p_hauch-_jr" startTime="489.920" stopTime="705.492">
            <label>Mr. John P. Hauch</label>
            <text syncTime="489.920" offset="2060147">Absolutely Your Honor, I agree with that whole heartedly and I would say this, we do not, in this case, have a time, manner and place restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.400" offset="2094106">We have a censorship of the message itself, it is prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.240" offset="2109466">The time, the manner, the place is not significant, it is not a purpose of this ordinance, it's just a complete and total suppression of a message and I think that distinguishes it from all the cases including the American Mini Theatre case in which the time and manner may be recently regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.659" offset="2191177">We do not contend to camp it, part of the passage of this repeal, I might say the court the township did have a regulatory scheme for signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.255" offset="2233495">It embraced at least two facets, one facet was that the sign, the number of signs, the square footage of the signs, the time when after which they have to be removed was all provided by this ordinance, reasonable regulation and this pertains particularly to house for sale signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.611" offset="2310922">In addition, it is notable that in the ordinance in sections 17 (3) there was a requirement that anyone putting up a sign of this nature or any other nature must get a permit from the building inspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.452" offset="2366302">There is no fee charged for the permit in connection with house for sale signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.226" offset="2385423">That was the regulatory scheme and I think it provided adequate means for monitoring in the event, it was any fraud of illegal activity in the use of real estate signs, which is not on this record, but if they were, the legislation certainly would provide adequate means for monitoring.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.192" offset="2461283">Moving on, the justification upon analysis cannot in any way come out to anything except a totally illogical approach to how to achieve the stated goals of the township.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.038" offset="2532649">The same message can be conveyed for sale in a newspaper, it can be conveyed in a broker’s office, in a multiple listing book or even a Church, by neighbors talking or a social function.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.191" offset="2589283">The message itself is what the township wants to suppress to achieve their goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.010" offset="2612584">A person is going to, if we follow the township’s theory, had the same psychological fear, if that is what some people have when the person receives a message, ‘For Sale’, because that message says people are moving out.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.330" offset="2673815">Whether he gets that message through a sign on a property, a newspaper or broker or a neighbor is not significant, it is the message that would create the fear.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.420" offset="2718223">In addition, I think there is a distinction between ‘For Sale’ signs on property and other possible methods of advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.923" offset="2752183">A broker requires a contract in most cases to pay your fee or the broker’s commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.445" offset="2778305">A newspaper cannot be as objective because the purpose of advertiser is to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.442" offset="2798263">He is certainly going to puff the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.180" offset="2805263">We don’t see real estate ads indicating that a house has holes in the roof, or things of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.623" offset="2826997">So, it is not strictly objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.819" offset="2835774">It's hard you can see anything more objective than a person without outside influences, driving around on a weekend in a suburban community, and seeing a sign, and seeing the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.788" offset="2883631">There is no other way that he is going to see these two things together in a completely objective setting as far as he is concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="1665.011" offset="6760516">The only thing that caused panic was the fact of the advertisement for homes of sale through one particular mode or method and that was the forest of ‘For Sales’ signs on the lawns of all the homes in the residential areas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.364" offset="8073952">The soul thing that steered up people were the abundance of 'For Sale' signs, the signs that when people would walk to and from their home to take a walk in their neighborhood or to drive to and from work or to go to the store or take your child to walk him or her to school, that was what did it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2048.230" offset="8293381">I have no idea how many other homes were up for sale through not utilizing signs.</text>

            <text syncTime="3188.875" offset="12856032">I just want to make it absolutely clear, however that in fact the action of Willingboro was not to affect prospective, as shown by the statistics because it did not have that impact but present residents of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.009" offset="12940565">As to the First Amendment argument, obviously petitioners contend there is a violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.707" offset="12971285">It is Willingboro’s response that there must be although, commercial speeches not wholly outside of the protection of the First Amendment, there must be afforded a lesser degree of protection and that is based on the court’s recognition, I believe, I am quoting from Virginia Pharmacy of the common sense differences between commercial speech and philosophical or economic or political speech or newspapers or anything like that and indeed the court itself has long recognized the obvious distinction in a billboard situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.892" offset="13124049">I need only refer back to Packer Versus Utah, which I believe is a case out of the early 1930s.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.547" offset="13170651">The Court has continued to recognize that and I might refer to the concepts developed in Lehman V. Shaker Heights, where the community in Willingboro situation is having this trust upon concept, forest of signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.791" offset="13263647">If in fact, you as a Judge, may not believe that 200 and some signs is sufficient to create a forest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3302.507" offset="13310563">I would submit that if in fact because of the way the public perceives it, if in fact they believed they are to be a forest of signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.917" offset="13348179">If in fact they reacted out of fear, if they were dominated by this fear, they are the determining guidelines as to determine whether or not the signs had this impact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.217" offset="13413381">With respect of the First Amendment, it clearly shows there was a deceptive impact.</text>
