            <label>Mr. Allan L. Bioff</label>
            <text syncTime="49.712" offset="299389">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.206" offset="317361">The issue in this case is whether an employer may be required to arbitrate a dispute between the employer and a union, where the dispute, i.e., both the events which give rise to the alleged liability and the union’s claim concerning that liability, all occur after the agreement to arbitrate has ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.622" offset="438987">The facts of the case are undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.470" offset="454347">The Employer, Nolde, a manufacturer of bakery goods, maintained and operated a bakery plant in Norfolk, Virginia and had entered into a Labor Agreement in July of 1970 with the Respondent Union which had a term extending until July 21, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.534" offset="546612">However, the duration clause of the Labor Agreement provided that after July 21, 1973 the Labor Agreement would remain in effect until either a new agreement was reached by the parties or either party gave written notice to the other of cancellation.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.446" offset="646295">The Labor Agreement contained a severance pay provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.405" offset="670119">That provision, in general terms, stated that employees with three or more years of continuous service with the employer would be entitled to a severance payment based upon a formula set out in the contract upon the happening of certain contingencies, one of which was the permanent closing of the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.510" offset="770534">The agreement also contained a grievance arbitration procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.259" offset="797492">In mid-May 1973, the Union gave notice to the company pursuant to Section 8(d) of the National Labor Relations Act of its intention to negotiate a new agreement, and negotiations between the company and the union then commenced and continued for a period of some three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.996" offset="892473">No agreement was reached by the parties during this period of negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.985" offset="912431">On August 20, 1973 the union sent to the company, a written notice of seven-day cancellation of the contract pursuant to the Duration Clause of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.994" offset="976483">That notice was sent on August 20, 1973 which meant that the Labor Agreement terminated by reason of the Union’s notice on August 27, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.392" offset="1034057">The negotiators for the parties met on August 31, 1973, at which time the union rejected the company’s final proposal for a new contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.235" offset="1093407">At that meeting, the union advised the company that unless the company accepted the union’s proposals, the union would go out on strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.081" offset="1136770">After considering the union’s proposals, considering its financial position, the employer concluded that it could not survive at its Norfolk, Virginia plant in the face of a strike and it accordingly notified the union that effective that night, August 31, 1973, the employer was permanently closing its Norfolk, Virginia plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.872" offset="1243977">And in fact, on that date, the employer did close permanently its Norfolk, Virginia plant and on that date it terminated the employees represented by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.511" offset="1298521">Subsequent to the plant closing, subsequent to the termination of the employees, the union made a demand upon the Company for the payment of severance pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.203" offset="1353273">The employer declined to pay severance pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.887" offset="1368006">The union then made a demand upon the employer to arbitrate the issue as to whether the employer was obligated to pay the severance pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.561" offset="1406772">The employer declined to arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.308" offset="1417743">In both instances, the employer’s position was that the obligation to pay severance pay and the duty to arbitrate, both were extinguished or expired when the contract ended.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.110" offset="1472914">Suppose, hypothetically, that instead of that sequence, the parties had rocked along for another year or two without a contract, as I am sure you know sometimes happens.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.685" offset="1699239">On those facts, I think we would have the same fact situation as we have in this case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="404.029" offset="1716584">Five years later then, it still would have to be the same, wouldn’t it?</text>

          <turn speaker="allan_l_bioff" startTime="406.584" stopTime="540.685">
            <label>Mr. Allan L. Bioff</label>
            <text syncTime="406.584" offset="1726824">Yes, our position is simply this.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.532" offset="1750648">That under the contract the employees were not entitled to severance pay simply because there was no contract after August 27, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.093" offset="1800907">That is not to say, and I think that this point is at the very heart of this litigation, that is not to say that the employees were automatically divested of a right to severance pay when the contract terminated, because under the National Labor Relations Act, when a contract ends, the terms and conditions of employment that are set forth in that contract continue in effect until such time as either the employer and the union agree to new terms and conditions of employment or the employer bargains away the existing terms and conditions of employment by bargaining with the union to an impasse.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.528" offset="1998602">In this case, the record is unclear as to exactly what happened on August 31, 1973, i.e., whether the union made any demand upon the employer to negotiate with the employer over the ending of severance benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.245" offset="2077492">Thus, it is unclear whether there may have been a waiver by the union of its right to bargain over the elimination of the severance benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.960" offset="2104346">But assuming that there was no waiver of that right, and assuming that the employer simply unilaterally ended the severance benefits, that would be arguably a violation of Section 885 of the National Labor Relations Act, one of the remedies for which might have been the payment of the severance benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.320" offset="2189818">The point is here, the union never filed an unfair labor practice charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.526" offset="2206641">It never filed a complaint with the Labor Board saying the employer had unilaterally terminated the severance benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.069" offset="2244780">I am not sure, Mr. Chief Justice, that answered your question but I think –</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="540.685" offset="2263275">Well, I take your answer to be that no matter how much time had elapsed, the men kept on working, the factory is open.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.722" offset="2299428">But when, as and if the factory was closed, severance pay under the original contract would be enforceable.</text>

            <text syncTime="560.790" offset="2343627">Assuming the contract had been terminated, severance pay would not be enforceable under the contract because the contract no longer existed.</text>

            <text syncTime="573.902" offset="2396081">I thought you said at first it would be the same whether it was three days, three weeks or three years.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan L. Bioff</label>
            <text syncTime="582.433" offset="2430249">I am saying that, what I am saying is whether it is three days, three weeks or three years after the termination of the contract, there is no right to severance pay under the contract because the contract no longer exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.019" offset="2484584">Consequently, there is no right to arbitrate the question of whether or not severance pay is owing, again, because there is no agreement to arbitrate and the duty, as this Court has frequently said, to arbitrate depends upon the existence of an agreement to arbitrate.</text>

            <text syncTime="682.724" offset="2831386">When the individual works Monday through Friday, the contract ends, the employer refuses to pay for that last week’s work.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.574" offset="2866808">I think that issue might very well be arbitrable because all of the events giving rise to the grievance that was filed occurred while the contract existed and indeed the employer’s liability for the payment of those wages came into existence during the term of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.061" offset="2936712">In our case, the difference is that there was no liability created for severance pay until after the contract terminated.</text>

            <text syncTime="734.040" offset="3036604">It would be our position that that grievance is arbitrable because the event giving rise to a claimed liability occurred while the contract existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.755" offset="3079549">If the man was discharged on Monday and the contract expired on Saturday, it would be our position that that discharge grievance would not be arbitrable.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.121" offset="3112986">Let me take this case, now, let us assume that there is a provision in the contract that says, “An employee with one year or more of service may not be discharged without a prior warning notice”.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.416" offset="3166171">And let us assume that the contract expires on Saturday and the employer discharges the employee on Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.863" offset="3215908">But the employee has not had a prior warning notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.301" offset="3233672">It would be our position on those facts that, that discharge is not subject to the Grievance Arbitration Procedure simply because at the time, the discharge occurred, the Grievance Arbitration Procedure no longer existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.190" offset="3285289">However, that employee might very well have a claim before the National Labor Relations Board, that the employer had unilaterally changed the terms and conditions of employment after the contract ended without bargaining with the union because the pre-existing term and condition of employment was that employees would not be discharged, i.e. employees with more than a year of service, would not be discharged without a prior warning notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.759" offset="3399497">After the contract ends, the employer discharges the employee without a prior warning notice, hence, there is a change, a unilateral change in terms and conditions of employment and the employee has a case before the Labor Board under 885.</text>

            <text syncTime="987.825" offset="4051827">Assume the contract said in words, "You will earn 'x' dollars of severance pay for so many months that you worked, and in no circumstances shall this be bargained away, taken away or any other.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.693" offset="4159242">The right to the money stems from the fact that the severance pay obligation becomes a term and condition of employment after the agreement ends that the employer may not unilaterally change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.602" offset="4206889">It does not stem from a contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.402" offset="4214099">The terminology “accrued right” and “vested right” as far as we are concerned is simply a label.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.078" offset="4240849">The question is what do you mean by that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.349" offset="4249939">If you mean by an accrued right that the employer and the union may not bargain to eliminate it, then we do not agree there is such a thing as an accrued right because under the National Labor Relations Act, the employer and the union can bargain to eliminate any right that exists under a labor contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.150" offset="4317126">Let us take the severance pay case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.690" offset="4327262">Let us take our case, and let us assume that instead of the employer simply notifying the union on August 31, 1973 that it was going to close the plant and it was not going to pay severance pay, assume instead the employer had come to the union and said, "We are contemplating, closing the plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.006" offset="4412525">We are in poor financial condition, we do not want to pay severance pay. We want to negotiate with you about the severance pay" and they do negotiate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1204.296" offset="4917629">The fundamental thing that is at the very core of this lawsuit, and it is a very important issue, is that the Fourth Circuit has confused two very distinct national labor policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.356" offset="4981890">The first National Labor Policy is that when you have an existing labor agreement, the parties are encouraged to resolve their controversies and their disputes by peaceful means pursuant to a Grievance Arbitration Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.214" offset="5041345">Indeed, that is spelled out in the Labor Management Relations Act in Section 203(d).</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.504" offset="5066527">Incidentally, the language of Section 203(d) is very interesting because it says, "Final adjustment by a method agreed upon by the parties is hereby declared to be the desirable method for settlement of grievances, grievance disputes arising over the application or interpretation of an existing collective bargaining agreement.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.035" offset="5176659">Now that is one very important national labor policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.384" offset="5194005">But there is an equally important National Labor Policy that comes into play when a labor contract expires and during the hiatus between labor contacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.208" offset="5237368">And that important labor policy is that the parties are free to bargain collectively and to utilize their respective economic strengths to obtain what they desire in those negotiations.</text>
