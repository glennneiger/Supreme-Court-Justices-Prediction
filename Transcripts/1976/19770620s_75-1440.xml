            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100610">In the case that I've just announced, the Bill against Doe, we held that the Social Security Act does not require the funding of non-therapeutic abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.077" offset="152855">This case, Maher against Roe, presents a constitutional question, whether a state Medicare program validly may deny funding for such abortions while providing it for childbirth.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.448" offset="214399">A Connecticut regulation limits Medicare benefits for first trimester abortions to those that are medically necessary, a term defined to include psychiatric necessity but not elective abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.428" offset="286288">Respondents in this case, two indigent women unable to obtain a physician's certificate of medical necessity challenged the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.171" offset="333204">Relying on our 1973 decisions in Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, a three-judge district court held that the regulation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.903" offset="392137">We noted probable jurisdiction and we now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.369" offset="414079">Our cases recognize a basic distinction between direct state interference with a protected activity and state encouragement of an alternative activity consonant with legislative policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.454" offset="474370">Unlike the laws invalidated in our previous abortion decisions, the Connecticut regulation does not interfere with the protected right to choose abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.407" offset="522226">The pregnant woman remains free of legal restraints, nor does a regulation violate the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.418" offset="558275">We have noted in prior decisions that a State has a strong and legitimate interest in normal childbirth.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.822" offset="591817">Connecticut, as a matter of policy and in furtherance of this issue, has chosen to fund childbirth expenses but not those of non-therapeutic abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.428" offset="642285">We cannot say that the Constitution forbids a State to make this policy a choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.151" offset="673214">It is important to understand the nature and scope of our decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.258" offset="693590">We do not hold that the funding of such abortions is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.771" offset="711666">Congress is quite free to require provision about Medicare benefits for abortions as a condition of state participation in the Medicare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.271" offset="757642">Also, under the Social Security Act, as we have construed it today in the Bill against Doe, Connecticut is equally free to provide such benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.310" offset="809782">We hold only that the Constitution does not require a judicially imposed resolution of this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.537" offset="846667">It is an issue involving the weighing of important public interest, the type of issue that under our Constitution should be resolved by representatives of the people rather than by federal judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.037" offset="912705">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Blackmun have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.781" offset="939663">Mr. Justice Marshall also has filed a dissenting opinion and Mr. Justice Blackmun likewise has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Brennan and Mr. Justice Marshall have joined.</text>
