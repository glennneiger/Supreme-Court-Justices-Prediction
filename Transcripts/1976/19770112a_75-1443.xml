            <text syncTime="657.615" offset="2730987">Several years elapsed, four-and-a-half I believe, when he again went to the Social Security because he was still unable to work and his family physician confirmed his disability, he again filed an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.293" offset="2793681">He was summarily denied and it was at this point that he retained counsel, that counsel being myself.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.620" offset="2834954">After the final decision of the appeals, counsel was rendered, District Court action was filed in the Northern district of Indiana, and the cause was summarily dismissed for a lack of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.833" offset="2903813">This court knows that the divided Court Of Appeals reversed that decision on the basis of the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.096" offset="2944878">I would like because it is central to the respondents arguments, direct the courts attention in addition to this statutes already cited.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.408" offset="3014154">The Social Security Regulation which is found on Page 15 on Respondents brief, and is known codified as 20CFR404.957, which in pertinent part states that an initial revised or reconsidered determination of the administration, or a decision or revised decision of a hearing examiner or of the appeals counsel which is otherwise final, maybe reopened, see at anytime, when such determination or decision is unfavorable to the party thereto but only for the purpose of correcting error on the face of the evidence on which such determination or decision was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.594" offset="3242883">Continuing, I would like to call the court’s attention to the definition of error on the face of the evidence or as some courts have referred to it as manifest error on the face.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.708" offset="3291366">The definition is also found at Page 15 of the Respondents brief, and it is to be found also in the Social Security Claims Manual, Section 7015 and it reads as follows: An error on the face of evidence exists, where on the basis of all the evidence in the file on the which determination or decision was based, and any evidence or record anywhere in the administration at a time such determination or decision was made, it is clear that the determination or decision was incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.428" offset="3434203">Now, I point that out to the court because the complaint that was filed by Mr. Sanders alleged error on the face of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.505" offset="3470566">He was obviously late in filing his claim, more than 60 days, in fact, over four years had elapsed from the time of the initial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.879" offset="3516019">If we strip this case to the bone, what we have is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.415" offset="3542141">Mr. Sanders, who had contributed to the Social Security Fund at one time became in the course of his life, disabled.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.696" offset="3583310">He filed a claim for benefits, it was summarily denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.728" offset="3603372">He did not timely prosecute his appeal but he was later advised that the social security administration affords him relief to have his case reopened at anytime, if there is manifest error on the face of that evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="955.346" offset="3921857">There are four aspects of the argument which I would like to point out before I get to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.325" offset="3945785">One is as counsel has stated, whether or not Section 405(h) that is the U.S code Section 405(h) is a preclusion of any manner of review, except as that specified in Section 405(g) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.912" offset="4016107">The second question is, can Section 405(g) of the Act serve as the basis of jurisdiction to review reopening petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.392" offset="4054037">The third question is whether the Administrative Procedure Act can be regarded as the basis of jurisdiction in reopening petitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.311" offset="4093743">The fourth item of the argument refers to whether or not the entertainment of jurisdiction, in this type of case would result in a flood of re-litigation of stale claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.026" offset="4160617">And this point is made because the Secretary makes much of it in his brief and in the court below and we will explain in the course of the argument that this has not occurred and that it will not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.990" offset="4236476">The first question then is whether or not Section 405(h) of the Act is a total preclusion of any review other than that specified in Section 405(g) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.718" offset="4311395">I would like to admit at the very outset that all of the three questions that are raised are extremely close questions and that very candidly, they can with reason be interpreted either way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.712" offset="4399376">I refer to a comment that Mr. Justice Brennan made in his decent in Salfi that is the case of Weinberger v. Salfi decided by this court last year, where he says discussing that the very problem of the interpretation of 405(h), the justice says, the question involves complicated questions of legislative intent and statutory provisions 42 USC Section 405(h) which has baffled District Courts and Courts of Appeals for years in this and other contexts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.514" offset="4550572">So let it be known that it is a difficult question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.349" offset="4593936">The problem of this court then is what is the more reasonable construction of that statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.577" offset="4626850">Should it be construed as a total preclusion or should there be an avenue of escape?</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.061" offset="4652763">For example, Justice Brennan just raised by his question, the hypothetical of one being denied any benefits because he was say, a black man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.947" offset="4704277">Would Section 405(h) be a total preclusion?</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.695" offset="4731340">The leading case in the Court Of Appeals, which I think, started this matter of petitions to reopen, is the frequently cited case of Cappadora v. Celebrezze, out of the Second Circuit which is cited at -- I am reading from Page 7 of the Respondent's brief, where the court recognized this problem in that case and also admitted that the statute could be construed in more than one manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.004" offset="4876476">Reading from the opinion of the court, it is stated although it could be argued that the second sentence of Section 405(h) of the Social Security Act is a statutory preclusion of such review, the more reasonable construction is that this simply forbids attempts to review final decisions on the merits, by any route other than provided in section 405(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.771" offset="4983578">As we will point out later that served as the leading case for many others circuits which are followed in line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.415" offset="5010119">But to point to the very language of the second sentence of 405(h), where it says, "no findings of fact or decisions of the Secretary shall be reviewed by any person tribunal or governmental agency except as provided herein that as provided herein can mean in the manner provided herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.097" offset="5116907">As opposed to stating that only this type of situation is amendable to judicial review, and I believe that is the way the court in Cappadora v. Celebrezze interpreted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.816" offset="5175735">As I stated many circuits followed the lead of Cappadora, there was only one that did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.621" offset="5206977">That was the case of Stuckey v. Weinberger which is also cited at Page 7 of Respondent's brief, but it is interesting to note that in that alone maverick decision, five of the Justices filed a concurring opinion in which they stated as follows, and I am reading from Page 7 on Respondents brief, the second sentence of 42 USC Section 405(h) should not be construed to preclude judicial review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1737.020" offset="7048610">In Cappadora, the jurisdictional basis was whether or not there was an abuse of discretion in refusing to reopen the initial determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.271" offset="7097616">The court, while stating that the District Court had jurisdiction to review that question, on the merits they found that there was not an abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.754" offset="7131575">But in this particular case, the record will show that the record of the secretary was never produced in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.046" offset="7212659">And therefore, the District Court not only failed to concerns itself with the record, it had no concern in obtaining it so that there was no concern of the record in the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1816.763" offset="7367513">Your 405(g) point, I take it would be that the only thing the District Court would have power to review, the refusal to reopen is a final decision, and all the Secretary, all the District Court has power to review as far that the Secretary complied with the reopening provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.982" offset="7440447">You do not claim that you would be able to go back and re-litigate the merits as if you would petition for review, the first time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.962" offset="7464375">I do advance a theory in the brief, Your Honor, for that may be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.279" offset="7489661">And if I can skip through that, I would say, essentially, what you say is correct that the decision to be reviewed is the decision not to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.916" offset="7532189">However, at Page 18 of the Respondent's brief, I might say this before I get in to that, that I advance several theories of how Section 405(g) may service as the jurisdictional base, and this would be one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.511" offset="7646605">It is to be noted that Section 405(g) states that the statute of limitations is 60 days or within such further time as the Secretary may allow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.278" offset="7693625">And when that provision is read in conjunction with the reopening regulation, I feel that a reasonable construction of the statute is that a party is entitled at any time to ask for reconsideration or rather a reopening for alleged error on the face of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.513" offset="7810550">That the 205(g) requirements would be satisfied because there had been a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.870" offset="7843986">Mr. Sanders had a hearing initially and when he goes back to ask for a review of the decision denying the reopening, it is a final decision under Section 405(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.351" offset="7917965">I know this is not as clear as it might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.425" offset="7930190">It is set forth in the brief to put it another way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.465" offset="7950357">Because Section 405(g) gives the Secretary, the authority to extend the statute of limitations and since the Secretary has extended the statute of limitations in cases of error on the face of the evidence, I say basically, it is possible to have the initial determination reviewed but only not on the merits but only for the purpose of ascertaining the existence of error on the face of the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1994.348" offset="8077939">And under your hypothesis that the secretary would repeal his regulations permitting reopening administratively, then there would be nothing you could do on the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2005.815" offset="8123810">But I feel this that the regulation is in effect, it was promulgated, and I believe that claimants have a right to rely on its continued existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.590" offset="8174905">As I stated, since this courts decision in Weinberger v. Salfi and in Eldridge v. Mathews, the Section 405(g) requirements have been liberalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.442" offset="8234256">I won’t get in to the areas prepared to get in to the waivable and non-waivable which is referred to by this court in Eldridge but basically, what seems to be central to the jurisdictional facet under 405(g) is in the language of the Weinberger v. Salfi that a claim be filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.176" offset="8333208">That a claim for benefits be filed and it was in that case that the members of the class who never file a case were dismissed out because they had never filed a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.388" offset="8378034">And as I read these new decisions, other elements of a final decision after a hearing can be waived, they can be dispensed with so long as there has been the filing of a claim for benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.801" offset="8435712">And I would direct the courts attention to the brief of amicus curiae in this case at page 11, for the theory is advanced that since those decisions and since Mr. Sander’s second application constitutes a claim for benefits under Section 405(b) of the Act that the requirements of 405(g) have been satisfied and therefore there is jurisdiction under 405(g).</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.680" offset="8567265">To proceed, finally we come to the question of whether the APA is a jurisdictional base.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.788" offset="8611673">Again, this is an extremely difficult question, a question upon which the text writers have agreed and disagreed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2150.209" offset="8701325">As I read it just briefly now, if anything, I would say would be supportive of the fact that the APA is available in this type case because the amendments specifically refer the claims against governmental officials specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.423" offset="8774154">I would point out too that the APA was not in existence on the social security act was enacted, the APA was enacted in 1946 so it could not have been envisioned in 1939 when the social Security Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.623" offset="8843013">Also, that by excluding Section 1331, in Section 405(h) by implication other sections of the statute are not excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.296" offset="8897661">There is a fancy Latin name, I believe, for that theory which escapes me right now but by implication, the APA not being excluded like 1331, it is by implication included.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.445" offset="8974252">Again -- amicus curiae handled this part of the brief which respondent adopted and at Pages 41 and 42 the many cases are cited where the courts have found that the APA is a jurisdictional grant, although by admission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.822" offset="9055754">Those courts did not thoroughly analyze that specific question, and there were three cases in this very court which are cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.005" offset="9092535">United States Supreme Court cases which held that the Administrative Procedure Act were the jurisdictional basis to review an administrative decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.432" offset="9130256">Those cases likewise are cited at Pages 41 and 42 of the amicus curiae brief, I say about them other time, I won’t get into them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.242" offset="9169439">But the very plain language of Section 702 states, again in effect, there shall be a right of judicial review for abuses of discretion from administrative actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.837" offset="9239865">In section 704 of the Act, the effect is without quoting it that where there is no other way of getting into court for an abuse of an administrative discretion than the APA affords an opportunity to go to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.492" offset="9330458">Final comment, as I said, the secretary has made much of the fact that if petitions to reopen are allowed, there would be a flood of re-litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.592" offset="9366925">I call the court's attention to this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.451" offset="9374344">You can only re-litigate, litigate, a petition to reopen once.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.175" offset="9393257">Once the District Court passes upon that, it becomes Res Judicata, it can not be litigated again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.332" offset="9417812">The Court in Cappadora versus Celebrezze, very wisely made the observation too, that quoting from the case, a review of refuses to reopen necessarily limited to abuse of discretion would impose a relatively spiked burden on the agency and the courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2355.505" offset="9522510">In that case, the court said that the only thing precluded by subsection (h) was what was permitted by (g).</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.280" offset="9565665">That turns the statute on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.986" offset="9580502">The package of (g) and (h) are a preclusive package, an effort to canalize review of the administrators on the Secretary’s action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.215" offset="9625328">And to say that everything is permitted to go into court that is not absolutely precluded is simply to turn that upside down and to reach some rather curious results.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.485" offset="9678409">For example, that the only decision of the Secretaries that must be brought into court within 60 days and according to prescribed procedures as Mr. Justice Brennan was mentioning, are those that reach the merits of the claim and decided after a hearing as a final decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.289" offset="9753642">But every other interlocutory, premature, post mature or whatever sort of administrative decision that can be made then has open and time jurisdiction, no rules at all about the procedures of the scheme of review.</text>

            <text syncTime="2587.987" offset="10452470">The very fact that Congress saw fit to remove the amount in controversy limitation on Federal Jurisdiction as applied to agency action, and the sovereign immunity defense is the clearest evidence, that congress thought the APA did not confer jurisdiction.</text>
