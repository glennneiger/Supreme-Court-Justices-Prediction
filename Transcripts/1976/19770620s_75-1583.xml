            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100533">I also have to announce to the Court the decision in the case of Morris against Gressette coming to us from a three-judge District Court in South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.482" offset="162391">This case presents a rather technical issue under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.067" offset="184752">The issue consents a scope of judicial review where the Attorney General failed to interpose under that Act a timely objection to a reapportionment change in the laws of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.468" offset="242326">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we agree with the three-judge court that the Act does not contemplate the type of judicial review that was sorted in this case by the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.989" offset="288406">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.139" offset="301049">Dissenting opinions have been filed by Mr. Justice Brennan, joined by Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.258" offset="321529">Mr. Justice Blackmun also has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
