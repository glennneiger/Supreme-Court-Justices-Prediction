            <text syncTime="16.829" offset="167823">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.868" offset="179944">The issue in this case which arises under a statute, that has since been appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.956" offset="200320">It's whether the Variable Re-enlistment Bonus of an enlisted man who extends his enlistment in military service.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.845" offset="227905">It is computed as of the date, he signs his extension agreement or instead as of the later day which he enters in to the service of the extension period.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.559" offset="274716">This issue involves approximately $60 or $70 million military pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.423" offset="294152">This Court granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.408" offset="318080">In order to understand it's case, it is necessary first to understand the considerations that led to enactment of statutory authority for payment of Variable Re-enlistment Bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.428" offset="362174">Also to understand the manner in which the Department of Defense exercise that authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.404" offset="386103">The statute was enacted in 1965, during the first major phase of this country's military undertaking in Vietnam.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.794" offset="419644">At that time, the Department of Defense was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.892" offset="432078">That enlisted men possessing critical military skills would re-enter civilian life at the end of their original enlistment periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.488" offset="478472">Leaving the Department of Defense was the essential but expensive task of training new men in those skills.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.035" offset="512640">It was determined that the offer of a large bonus in addition to the existing so called regular re-enlistment bonus not induce substantial members if enlisted men to re-enlist at the end of their original enlistment periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.968" offset="580349">It was further determined that the size of the bonus in each case should depend upon the importance of the particular military skill to the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.369" offset="617965">Accordingly Congress authorized the Secretary of Defense to assign to each military skill and award level ranging from 0-4 depending upon the importance of that skill to the military at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.075" offset="676793">These award levels were subject to annual review and modification as the military's needs changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.040" offset="704692">The bonus called the Variable Re-enlistment Bonus was equal to Regular Re-enlistment Bonus multiplied by the award level in effect for the enlisted man skill at that skill level at the time of his re-enlistment.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.551" offset="770730">The present purposes, the most significant aspects of this history or that Variable Re-enlistment Bonus statute by its terms, refers only to re-enlistment not to extensions of enlistment and that there is no indication in the legislative history, that either the Department of Defense or Congress gave consideration to have or even whether the Variable Re-enlistment Bonus Program would apply to extensions of enlistment.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.666" offset="879190">Now, this is important because extensions differ from re-enlistments in two fundamental aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.375" offset="910014">It differs to timing and extension typically is entered in to right at the outset of the man's military service or is by contrast, a re-enlistment only takes place at the end of that original enlistment period.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="241.815" offset="1067690">I said extensions differ from re-enlistments in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.293" offset="1081691">I just described one way which they differ, that is as to timing.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.338" offset="1097783">The extension is entered into its beginning of the period of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.197" offset="1113247">The re-enlistment is entered into only at the end of the original enlistment period.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.928" offset="1132160">The second difference is more important for this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.601" offset="1146893">That is the difference in motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.438" offset="1158282">An enlisted man extends his enlistment at the outset of his military service, in order to qualify for specialized training that will lead to higher pay in the military and in some cases at least to a better career in civilian life after he leaves the military.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.542" offset="1230694">As a condition of eligibility for specialized training of this kind, the military requires often requires a longer minimum service commitment than the original enlistment period and the enlisted man extends his enlistment at beginning, in order to satisfy that condition of eligibility and receive a specialized training.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.366" offset="1317943">In contrast, a re-enlistment is entered into only at the end of the original enlistment period.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.299" offset="1341662">There is no built-in incentive other than the pay, allowances and other enjoyments that military life generally men afford.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.811" offset="1379696">Now, on view of these differences, we cannot know how Congress would have legislated with respect to extensions of enlistment.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.457" offset="1414282">If it had that matter, if it explicitly considered that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.091" offset="1432881">Congress might have concluded that the incentive of specialized training was sufficient alone to induce extensions and that no additional bonus need be provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.359" offset="1477916">On the other hand --</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="keith_a_jones" startTime="349.481" stopTime="571.813">
            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="349.481" offset="1498396">From four years to six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.389" offset="1506024">That's the extension in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.838" offset="1515846">It could be for a lesser or greater period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.138" offset="1529012">The original enlistment period here was four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.516" offset="1542596">I endure the differences in timing, that is if the extension is entered, if the extension agreement is signed at the beginning.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.140" offset="1573002">Congress had it considered the matter, might have acted to clarify the question, when Variable Reenlistment Bonus accrues in cases of extensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.936" offset="1612186">But it did neither.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.572" offset="1618769">The statute and a legislative history were silent as to the intended application of a Variable Reenlistment Bonus Program to extensions of enlistment.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.104" offset="1656908">Now, this is not to say that the program does not apply to extensions of enlistment, but it applies not by virtue of the language of the bonus statute itself former 37 U.S.C. 308(g), but rather as the consequence of the general catchall provision in 37 U.S.C. 906, which provides that a man who extends his enlistment is entitled to the same pay and allowances as are made available to a man who reenlists.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.041" offset="1784594">This means that when Congress passed the bonus statute, the Secretary of Defense was left with the delegated responsibility of accommodating the bonus program to a group, service members who extend their enlistments, that had not been within the explicit contemplation of Congress when it enacted the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.675" offset="1863170">Now, the major question confronting the Secretary in this regard was whether in cases of extensions the bonus was to be measured on the basis of the award level that was in effect when the extension agreement was signed or instead on the basis of the award level that was in effect on the later date, when the extended period was entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.661" offset="1955121">Now, the former alternative would have conceitedly had the advantage of relative certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.401" offset="1982080">That is at the time the agreement was signed, every one would know what award level would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.340" offset="2005799">On the other hand, relative certainty is to the award level that will apply to a bonus that will not be received for several years, might not be of major significance as compared with the basic incentive or specialized training.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.772" offset="2063582">But in any event several other considerations militated against measuring a bonus as of the earlier date.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.575" offset="2098795">That form of computation would have led to a potential disparity between the treatment of reenlistments and extensions, would have created the possibility, that a man who entered into his extension period would receive a different bonus, perhaps greater, perhaps smaller depending upon what it happened to the award level in intervening time, from that received by a man who entered into his reenlistment period on the same day possessing the same skill.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.497" offset="2218436">Now, this disparity in treatment could be have been expected to have led to disputes and dissatisfaction and more than that it would appear to be contrary to the statutory command of equal treatment for extensions and re-enlistments.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.885" offset="2284055">Further more 37 U.S.C. 308(d) provides that a man who reenlists during basic training is not entitled to the bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.896" offset="2332016">That statute would seem to suggest in view of the requirement of equal treatment, that the bonus could not immediately vest in the case of an extension, that was entered into, the extension agreement that was signed during the period of basic training.</text>

            <text syncTime="576.808" offset="2407667">Well, if he dies before he enters into his extension period, our position is that he is not entitled to any bonus and the matter hasn't been fleshed out in litigation but I assume that would be the respondent's position too.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.098" offset="2464823">There is a provision in the regulations for recruitment, if the extension period is not fully served.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.602" offset="2486870">That is if for some reason, the man leaves the service having finished only one of the two years of his extension period, the Navy could recruit one-half of his Variable Re-enlistment Bonus.</text>

            <text syncTime="623.765" offset="2595539">Well, let me state further that the bonus is paid in installments so that the future installment simply wouldn't be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.068" offset="2628767">I think that, that more than an official recruitment would be the method by which the full bonus will not be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.504" offset="2662517">But moreover permitting the bonus divest at the time, the extension agreement was signed but also be the inconsistent with the Secretary's representation to Congress at the time the Bill is being considered that there would be no expressed or implied obligations with respect to the future payments of the bonuses.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="684.937" offset="2840254">Absolutely, and the enlistment agreements provide, and I will get to this little bit further, but they are normally provide that they are entered into in consideration of the pay the Bill accrued, whatever accrues is what the man gets under the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.755" offset="2903471">With consideration of the contrary that I just resided presumably in mind, the secretary promulgated regulations that in his view provide for computation of the Variable Re-enlistment Bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.304" offset="2961672">On the basis of the award level and affect on the day the man enters into the extended period of service, whether he enters into that service by way of reenlistment or extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.794" offset="3007647">Now, there can be no question under the Statute that the secretary had latitude to adopt this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.735" offset="3035441">The only question in this case is whether the regulations have the effect that the secretary intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.241" offset="3065430">Now, with this rather extensive background in mind, I will discuss the particular facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.123" offset="3093015">The respondents are Navy enlisted men who at the outset of their service, extended their enlistments from four years to six years, in order to qualify for training in the Navy's program, what was called Advanced Electronics Field.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.426" offset="3166158">Their extensions agreements stated that they were entered into and 'In consideration of pay, allowances and benefits which will accrue to me during the continuances of my service.'</text>
            <text syncTime="779.882" offset="3219970">The agreements didn't state that the respondents would be entitled at any point to a Variable Re-enlistment Bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.365" offset="3245988">Indeed the agreements didn't mention the Variable Re-enlistment Bonus at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.048" offset="3264692">Now, presume it to these extension agreements, each respondent in fact did receive the Advanced Electronic Field training and that training led to qualification in the Naval skill rating called Communications Technician Maintenance or CTM.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.232" offset="3337417">Now, the problem in this case arises because at the time the respondents sign their extension agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.912" offset="3364166">The CTM award level was set at four, the highest permissible, but by four years later when they entered into their extension period, the CTM award level had been reduced to zero.</text>

            <text syncTime="839.966" offset="3460297">Accordingly, the Navy refused to pay the respondents, the bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.036" offset="3484643">Respondents then brought this suit claiming that their right to bonus had accrued within the naming of their extension agreements at the time they signed those agreements and they requested payment of the bonus based upon an award level of four or any alternative release from service.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.902" offset="3556114">Some of the respondents submitted after Davidson in which they stated that they had been promised payment of the Variable Re-enlistment Bonus by a Recruiting Officer based upon the award level four.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.696" offset="3603239">In response, the head of the Navy's Variable Re-enlistment Bonus program submitted in after David, in which he stated and I quote ''It is not the policy of the Department of the Navy to promise specific eligibility for Variable Re-enlistment Bonus nor is any official authorized to make such a promise and counseling with the prospective enlistee'.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.711" offset="3695294">Government also submitted to the Court regulations requiring reenlistment interviewers to inform enlistee's, and I quote "We are the program flexibility and possibility of changes which might decrease the amount of bonus to which entitled at the time of reenlistment'.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.037" offset="3772617">Both sides then move for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.227" offset="3785365">The District Court granted the respondent's request for payment of the bonuses and denied their request for release from service.</text>
            <text syncTime="929.157" offset="3817130">Both sides appealed and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.050" offset="3836669">One point should be clarified in connection with these facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.613" offset="3850984">Respondents in this Court state as a fact that they were promise bonuses based upon an award level of four but that allegation was disputed in the District Court and the Court made no findings with respect to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.530" offset="3906573">More over by granting summary judgment for the Respondents, the District Court necessarily proceeded upon the assumption that no such promise had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.348" offset="3945861">In any of them, we take the position here that whether or not such a promise was made is legally immaterial and so, far as Respondents argue a theory of promissory of stopple and did not appear to do so, in this court, it is well established that the government is not to stop by the unauthorized representations of its agents and respondent have?</text>

            <text syncTime="993.632" offset="4075010">Respondents have abandoned their request for release from service which presumably was based upon some theory of misrepresentation or mutual mistake by failing to file a cross petition from that portion of the judgment below, that was adverse to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.816" offset="4135719">Accordingly respondents claim for entitlement to the bonus, turns upon the text of the applicable military regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.656" offset="4171141">Now, Department of Defense Instruction, 1304.15, Paragraph VI A, which we discussed in our brief, provides that 'the members will receive the award level effective on the date of their extension of enlistments'.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.551" offset="4250658">The term extension of enlistment is not defined in the regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.863" offset="4271974">We are showing some details however on Pages 28 to 30 of our brief, that both the Navy regulations and the extension agreements themselves provide that an extension does not become effective until the day following the expiration of the original enlistment period and as a corollary and this is the military's constructions of its own regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.632" offset="4367059">The extension of the enlistment occurs only when service of the extension period begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.296" offset="4389629">Now, this is a fair reading of the regulation and we submit that it should be sustained, but moreover as we point out in our reply brief, on Page 2, 'If extension of enlistment were read as the respondents suggest, as referring to the signing of the extension agreement then respondents would never have become even potentially eligible to receive a Variable Re-Enlistment Bonus".</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.455" offset="4498299">Paragraph V.B.1.b of the regulation, which is set forth to Page 59 of the Appendix, acquires that to be eligible for a bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.917" offset="4544170">A service member must have completed at least 21 months of continuous active service prior to extension of enlistment and respondents had not completed any substantial active service before they sign their extension agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.207" offset="4613342">In short, under the regulations respondents were entitled at most to the award level that was in effect on the days that they entered in to service of their extension periods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.569" offset="4662765">Since the CTM award level on those days was zero, the Navy properly refused payment of the Variable Reenlistment Bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.752" offset="4703516">Now, respondents claim however that paragraph V.B.1.f of the regulation which is at Page 61 of the Appendix implies, doesn't state but implies that they are entitled to a bonus, but that paragraph has no application to respondents at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.001" offset="4784496">It is designed solely to the deal with the fact that a 90 day in advance notice is given before an award level is reduced to terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.586" offset="4834860">There are service members so situated that upon hearing that their award level is to be reduced or terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.127" offset="4869028">They would be able to obtain an early discharge under the regulations and re-enlist, were possibly to sign an extension agreement towards the end of their period of service and then enter into service of the extended period.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.406" offset="4934125">Paragraph V.B.1.f is simply designed to prevent such service members from obtaining a Variable Reenlistment Bonus based upon the older outgoing award level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.539" offset="4986684">As to such service members, the purpose of this provision is to make a reduction or termination of award level effective immediately upon the issuance of the notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.181" offset="5029211">That's the only purpose in effect of this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.252" offset="5041436">It does not apply to respondents and would not assist them even if it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.160" offset="5065156">Now, I would concede that these regulations could have been written in a manner better calculated to reveal their objectives to the nonmilitary mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.557" offset="5114684">They are not plain on their face but they are interpreted and applied in a manner that I have described.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.717" offset="5143314">This Court's statement in a similar context, in Immigration and Naturalization Service against Stanisic, pertains here as well, and I have a quote from that opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.060" offset="5184692">Granting that this regulation is not free from ambiguity, we find it dispositive that the agency responsible for promulgating and administering the regulation, has interpreted it to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.177" offset="5241221">The Navy's interpretation here is not plainly erroneous; it is not inconsistent with the language of the regulation and it should therefore be given controlling weight in this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.419" offset="5286152">I have one final point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.198" offset="5297228">Respondents argue that if they are right and the military is wrong about the meaning of the military's own regulations, then congress acted unconstitutionally in repealing Variable Reenlistment Bonus, in a manner that deprived payments of the bonus or denied payment of the bonus to respondent Johnson.</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.275" offset="6537626">He was faced with a situation where first-termers, that is 'men and women in our service who are under four year contracts were enlisting at the rate of 25% and all other enlistments in our services fell in the rate of 85%".</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.308" offset="6621740">There was an astounding attrition rate, in that first term, and it was this findings by the Secretary, that drew him to the conclusion that something outs was needed to induce military personnel to extend their enlistments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.389" offset="6710034">This coupled with the fact that the training required for these men and women is very expensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.810" offset="6739709">The testimony in the Congress is that it was over $10,000 a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.750" offset="6759458">Therefore, of course, if you lost a person in a critically undermanned skill, you have to retrain them at a substantial cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.594" offset="6790805">So, in addition to training which was offered these, men and women, they were also offered bonuses, substantial bonuses to induce them to extend their enlistments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.618" offset="6846916">In critically undermanned skills, and it is this background that these plaintiffs survived in our services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.301" offset="6889652">They enlisted for four years in basic training, they were told, not Justice Rehnquist and Mr. Chief Justice that their pay wouldn't be changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.904" offset="6936045">They were told that if they extended their enlistments, they would receive bonuses and the bonuses were computed of their regular re-enlistment bonuses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1856.354" offset="7525890">And one that could be calculated, and I may say that when you look at the records, you are going to find that there will never be an other VRB case here, I don't believe because they were only dealing with a peculiarity of the manner in which this was administered by the Navy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.723" offset="7603422">When you look at, for instance, Taschler v. United States in 204 in the court acclaims you will see said out there exactly what happened in the other services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.492" offset="7642396">One of the problems here, as you know is that are they repealed or rather part of the class lost their bonuses because the Navy said that their skill was no longer critically undermanned and as a result they no longer got the bonuses and so they said, well, if we do not get the bonuses does that mean we have to serve the two years and the answer was categorically, yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.822" offset="7843748">The only thing, I can say is that when you look at the legislative history, it would appear that the men who are entitled to their bonuses through act of Congress and I would also say to you Sir, that the bonuses that they were entitled to, I believe, they were entitled to under the Navy regulations themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.362" offset="7921907">It's only when you gain into this slippery interpretation that the Secretary of the Navy used which was to say, "In the first three months of your four year extension or four year contract, you extend for two years or extend for two years making it a four year obligation".</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.861" offset="7999961">But we don't pay you the bonuses, until you start the first day of the third year.</text>

            <text syncTime="1982.616" offset="8030994">So, these men and women all enlist, or extend their enlistments induced by these bonuses, a whole two years and then as they approach the fifth year, the Navy says, 'These skills are no longer critically undermanned and therefore we don't give any bonuses'.</text>
            <text syncTime="2004.205" offset="8117303">And this has a peculiar effect, if properly administered in a computerized world of never having to pay the bonuses, because you always can induced enough people presumably through your recruitments to fill the necessary need, then declare, no longer critical and you don't get your bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.811" offset="8195774">In a majority the plaintiffs before this Court had that happen to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.423" offset="8214165">One plaintiff, in particular was denied his bonus for another reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.153" offset="8233077">That reason was a Congress in 1974, did away with the Variable Re-enlistment Bonuses and when they did that the question was raised whether or not the statute prohibited the Navy from paying that person's bonus.</text>

            <text syncTime="2917.278" offset="11769639">You see, if you fill a critical manned skill and then go on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.940" offset="11784268">Now, I may dwell on two other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.768" offset="11803598">There are two opposing cases here, one in the Fourth Circuit and the other in the Ninth Circuit and as I started to say, on the Fourth Circuit case in Carini, Judge Haynesworth says, in way that I don't understand, he said that, 'The paid benefit and allowances didn't include the Variable Re-enlistment Bonus', and he couldn't see it there and therefore that was evidence of the fact they wont promise the Variable Re-enlistment Bonus, and in the DC Circuit, the government had certified in the brief conceded that pay included the Variable Re-enlistment Bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.401" offset="11954063">So, either that was in air, or outs they changed the position there, I don't know which.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.731" offset="11979454">In the other case that is the other Circuit case, is Judge Snead's(ph) opinion in the Ninth Circuit and that has to do with only one group of the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.778" offset="12019579">It has to do with Mr. Johnson who is alleged was denied his bonus because of a change in the Statute that is to say that VRB was eliminated and there Judge Snead(ph) says that there is no evidence in the Statute itself that would indicate that there was any basis for preserving VRB for Mr. Johnson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.436" offset="12134204">So, in addition to losing his bonus under the regulations, the change in the regulations, it also has alleged, he loses it under a repeal of the 308(g) where they put in a new bonus provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.415" offset="12190106">Now, we have looked at Legislative History in here, again, we say, we don't see any support for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.390" offset="12218005">Judge Snead states it but if we review it, as we have, I don't see any support for that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.820" offset="12243709">Secondly if, that is so, we still look to an operation of the bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.671" offset="12275161">We give you an example in the brief itself where we say, we think they would be eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.041" offset="12296685">Johnson would be eligible under the current Statute because although VRB was eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.924" offset="12328137">We don't see any basis for denying it to Johnson and we think that the way the Statute operates, the multiple affects Johnson in a way where he can get his bonuses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.330" offset="12381845">In particular, we stated an illustration there to cover that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.834" offset="12403788">In addition to that, we also said that if there was an intent, then we outthrust into the question that the Court of Appeals below saw in United States v. Lynch where it appears clearly the reason for repealing the Variable Re-enlistment Investment Bonuses which were only in effect from 65 to 74 right in the period of the war, that if that was the case, Congress was exercising its fiscal responsibility and in that to that extend, they are impairing the men's contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.747" offset="12547461">But I don't think we have to get to that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.607" offset="12558955">I think Johnson is qualified because of his extension agreement and the agreement of the Congress to pay him at the time, he made that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.931" offset="12604199">If not, I think that he is still as eligible under the Statute, as it's amended, and lastly if that isn't the case, then it appears we have or look to the question of the conflict of the Statute and Lynch v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.760" offset="12679536">In the few moments I had, have left, I'd like to dwell on, I haven't touched really on the equity fee or I also haven't which I am sure the court appreciate is, all the courts below have are very much on our side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.731" offset="12751425">Our people are people were induced to extend and did serve and they deserve a just consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.997" offset="12780473">I also think it was intended that they should do so, and the Congress intended to pay them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.586" offset="12802834">It is a large group, but I do think that the equities are very much on their side.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.624" offset="12830942">I would also say that I think that we concede, we do concede that basic pay could be change, we think that the Legislative History 308(g) indicates that Congress intended a specific amount of money be paid to these men and for that men and women and for that they serve.</text>

            <text syncTime="3612.881" offset="14551993">First, is there anything in the history of the other case or in the specifically, to properly know about with respect to an increase in the award level which the government did in fact pay, would tend to confirm with these.</text>

            <text syncTime="3625.217" offset="14601312">On my answer to that Mr. Justice Stevens is yes or no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3628.740" offset="14615419">The Page 105 of the Appendix, there is a schedule of award levels which indicates that some award levels decreased, some increased and some stayed the same over a period of several years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.965" offset="14676336">However, there is nothing in this record that establishes what the Navy's treatment was but it is my understanding that the Navy has consistently administered the regulation so that when the award level went up, a man was entitled to the larger bonus, when it went down, he was entitled to a smaller bonus.</text>

            <text syncTime="3677.521" offset="14810605">That is not -- I think the Court, the Court's allusions to the Legislative History were based upon statements that were made with respect to reenlistments and not with respect to extensions of enlistment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.852" offset="14871836">There was a language in the Legislative History which indicated that the bonus would become available at the decision point, that was the decision point of reenlistment which was at the end of the original enlistment period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3704.227" offset="14917394">There is no indication in legislative history that these Congressmen ever considered the application of the program to the extensions of enlistment which presented a very different kind of problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="3714.380" offset="14958041">Mr. Jones, I had a second question I want to ask you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3717.319" offset="14969743">Would you agree that if your opponent is correct and the if the right vested at the time the extension agreement is signed, it would be more or less an analogous to say earned compensation for a month of service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3731.352" offset="15025854">On that hypothesis, the example of Mr. Justice Rehnquist gave of changing the level of pay, would really not be appropriate because that would -- you wouldn't say that the government could change the level of pay for October, some time in November.</text>

            <label>Mr. Keith A. Jones</label>
            <text syncTime="3746.029" offset="15084578">Again Mr. Justice Stevens, yes and no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.081" offset="15096803">Mr. Chief Justice asked me a similar question during my opening argument and I said that the same line of analysis could be argued to suggest that the level of the pay upon original enlistment was fixed, and the same while the respondents argued that there bonus was fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.747" offset="15171513">Now, if a court accepted that argument then the same consequences would flow that is, there might be a constitutional barrier to reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3777.451" offset="15210279">Now, that's first half of the answer, second half is that they are talking about vesting in a peculiar sense, they are not saying that they would be entitled to the bonus if they never serve there extension periods, that is, they are not really talking about the vesting of pay for the services already done but they are saying that they had a vested contract right for quid pro quo once they performed the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.078" offset="15316754">So, it's a little different from pay for service which has already been done but it is analogous.</text>
