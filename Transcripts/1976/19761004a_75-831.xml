            <text syncTime="48.503" offset="294461">Your Honor, Mr. Chief Justices, and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.794" offset="311702">This is an appeal by the President and members of the New York State Tax Commission and by employees of the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.487" offset="354438">It is an appeal from an order in judgment of the United States District Court with the District of Vermont which denied the appellant’s motion to dismiss this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.590" offset="422879">The appellee originally had come before the District Court in order to enjoin the appellants from the enforcement and the execution of various provisions of the New York State Sales Tax Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.024" offset="480557">Since they sought an injunction, a three-judge court was convened and the three-judge court decided against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.817" offset="519741">That is why we are here.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.641" offset="531026">The basic facts leading up to the action are that the appellee is a Vermont corporation with its place of business in Arlington, Vermont which is located approximately six miles from the New York border.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.909" offset="588077">The appellee is engaged in the retail sale of furniture and in its operations, a large portion of the sales made are made to nonresidents of the State of Vermont and are made to the residents of the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.143" offset="661011">Some of the articles in the store purchased by New York residents are carried away by the residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.419" offset="686193">Other articles are delivered by Griffin to purchasers in New York by use of Griffin’s own trucks by their own employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.995" offset="736453">These employees would come in and in many cases setup the furniture such as attaching legs to tables etcetera and they will also send repairmen in to do various repairs and touch up work on the furniture.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.757" offset="795490">Griffin also advertises extensively in New York by way of newspapers, radio and TV and a roadside sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.347" offset="841883">The New York State Tax Commission, based on the activities of Griffin within the State, were of the opinion that there was minimal contact within the State and we sought to have Griffin collect sales tax for the State of New York on those articles which are delivered into the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.884" offset="915966">We are not seeking to have sales tax collected on any articles which are sold to New York residents at Griffin store and carried away by the resident from the store.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.258" offset="965495">We are only after the tax on goods delivered into New York State.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="222.121" offset="989005">When you say you sought to have that tax collected, you sent one of your auditors, did you not, to the store in Arlington?</text>

            <text syncTime="229.096" offset="1016904">Yes sir, we sent one of our auditors to the store, based on the fact that we felt that there were minimal contacts within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.624" offset="1042921">When we arrived at the store, at that time, we were represented with the summons and complaint in Federal District Court.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="242.221" offset="1069357">What would New York have done, if the appellee here, Griffin had simply told the auditor in effect, get lost and not filed the lawsuit that he did?</text>

          <turn speaker="thomas_p_zolezzi" startTime="256.165" stopTime="285.964">
            <label>Mr. Thomas P. Zolezzi</label>
            <text syncTime="256.165" offset="1125155">Had we been told get lost, we would come home and then based on external indices, what we did in this case really, we went to the Vermont Tax Commission and we obtained figures and facts relating to Griffin Sales and those sales upon which it had not paid sales tax to Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.980" offset="1216375">We took a percentage of that and applied it to New York, basically what you can say is was it an arbitrary figure...</text>

            <text syncTime="289.420" offset="1258170">Yes, and based on these figures that we obtained from Vermont, what we would do, is come back, obtain a judgment in New York, and then under the provisions of Article 25 of the New York State Tax Law, we would have gone into Vermont and sought to enforce our New York claim in the Vermont courts.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="308.425" offset="1334135">Well, now would Griffin have had an opportunity in the New York proceeding to litigate its claim that this was an unconstitutional exercise of advising authority?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas P. Zolezzi</label>
            <text syncTime="318.629" offset="1374990">When we went into seek a judgment in the New York Courts, we would not do it ex parte.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.932" offset="1392231">We would have to serve motion papers and they would be put on notice that such an action was pending and they could come in and defend thier point.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.876" offset="1436012">Correct, it would be the long arm service under Section 302 of our Civil Practice Law and Rules which under the theory of doing a transaction of any business within the state would permit us to have jurisdiction over any foreign corporations.</text>

            <text syncTime="371.635" offset="1587000">There would be no transactions or no completion of the sale within the State of New York because the entire operation would be completed in Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.205" offset="1625348">The purchaser would have his own vehicle etcetera, pick up the goods and transport them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1839.215" offset="7457341">Section 1341 of Title 28 does not by it terms require a dismissal of Federal Court complaint that involves state taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.279" offset="7497570">Rather it requires the District Court to make inquiry of the quality of the remedies that are available to the particular litigant in the State Court and it is not helpful in that analysis to have a long list of cases which uphold the efficacy of the remedies of the certain state without testing to see whether they are relevant to the particular plaintiff in the case before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.718" offset="7603313">The appellants assert the availability of two remedies for Griffin in this case, both of which we submit do not pass the test of Section 1341.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.579" offset="7650752">The first remedy is that set forth by the statute which requires as a first step that all of the books and records of Griffin Incorporated be turned over to the taxing authorities of the State New York, dating back to 1965 which was when the sales tax was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.494" offset="7714490">The District Court for the Southern District of New York in the United States Steel case specifically held that submitting to an audit by a taxing authority of questionable jurisdiction constituted the irreparable injury and if that audit procedure constituted irreparable injury for United States Steel Company and the other corporations that were involved in that litigation the situation is certainly much worse when we look at this little Mom and Pop furniture store in Arlington, Vermont.</text>

            <text syncTime="2045.366" offset="8281975">There is another difference between the Ammex case which is important I think and that is that there was no issue in that case of about whether or not an injunction was available in the declaratory judgment proceeding because the party had stipulated that there would be no collection activities, pending completion of a litigation and there is no such stipulation here and Judge Kaufman thought that stipulation was important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.534" offset="8366611">The final thing, I should say about Ammex is when Ammex finally got into the Supreme Court in New York, the trial court in New York, that court held that a declaratory judgment remedy was improper and in an unreported opinion, this published in the New York law journal in January, the court said we are not going to decide this is a declaratory judgment and then it proceed to convert it into an Article 78 proceeding and decided in Ammex’s favor on the merits, but there is still I think even after Judge Kaufman’s decision in Ammex.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.967" offset="8484371">I think there is a substantial difference, that case was before our District Court in Vermont.</text>
