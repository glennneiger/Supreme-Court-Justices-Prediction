            <label>Mr. John R. Jordan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="38.028" offset="253035">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.400" offset="270589">In 1971, State of North Carolina enacted a general statute requiring that no grade other than applicable U.S. grade to be shown on closed containers of apples sold of offered to sale in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.572" offset="335268">In 1973, the statute was amended to include the words or shipped, an amendment which was probably not necessary but to make a material amendment making the U.S. grade the exclusive grade marking on closed containers.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.345" offset="402351">The statute has, at all times both in 1971 and in 1973, applied to apples grown within North Carolina as well as apples grown elsewhere and furthermore there has never at any time in any prohibition on the labeling of apple containers so as to state that they were grown in Washington or in any other jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.219" offset="485838">May we quickly explain that apples are graded by the use of terms of its extra fancy, fancy, number one and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.026" offset="525022">These grades can be arbitrarily changed from year to year by various agencies of the 13 commercial apple growing states.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.957" offset="560757">Apparently this is sometimes done to create a market for a particular quality of apple.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.191" offset="581760">Indeed the Washington State direct their marketing as this power and has changed the Washington State grades since this controversy begin.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.043" offset="625123">Thus, what was a fancy apple last year may not be this year, although the name is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.610" offset="655425">The General Assembly of North Carolina exercised the police power of the State to prevent confusion in the wholesale marketplace where apples are sold in closed containers and not available for a ready viewing by a professional apple purchaser.</text>

            <text syncTime="172.966" offset="792829">I believe that the practice in North Carolina is the same as the practice in Washington, some are sold in closed containers intrastate and some are not.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="182.262" offset="830027">But all apples imported into North Carolina from Washington and sold to wholesalers in North Carolina would be in closed containers?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. John R. Jordan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="192.857" offset="872346">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.691" offset="879764">Now, by use of the U.S. grade only there can be no arbitrarily manipulation of labels between fancy and extra fancy whether by North Carolina or by any other jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.682" offset="927725">The federal grades are the only uniform and consistent grades.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.704" offset="943817">The Washington State Apple Advertising Commission filed a suit for declaratory judgment that the statute is unconstitutional and prayed that enforcement be permanently enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.371" offset="986449">A Three-Judge District Court sitting in North Carolina held that the statute contravene the Commerce Clause and enjoined its enforcement insofar as it precluded the display of the Washington State grade on the containers, but it did not strike down the requirement of the North Carolina statute that the U.S. grades must be shown, and the Court will recall, as I indicated the moment ago, that that goes all away back to the 1971 enactment, the original enactment rather General Assembly.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.014" offset="1149035">Three questions are presented by the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.754" offset="1160006">They are the standing of Washington State Commission to bring this action, the jurisdictional amount, and the District Court’s determination that the North Carolina statute contravenes the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.698" offset="1211729">May it please the Court, we would like to briefly address each of those and first to address the threshold questions of standing and the jurisdictional amount requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.526" offset="1259062">We will respectfully submit that the Advertising Commission’s pleadings do not contain the necessary allegations of injury in fact to an established standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.123" offset="1301485">Rather the complaint alleges and injury to individuals who are not parties to this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.874" offset="1328444">I will come to the action in a representative capacity in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.455" offset="1342759">At this time, may it please the Court, I am talking about an action by the Commission for itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.654" offset="1371598">Now, the claim is an advertising activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.765" offset="1391973">It's interesting to note that there is a self-serving portion of the statute creating the Advertising Commission, and it is said out in the opinions, elaborately stating that it was enacted within the police power of the State of Washington, the very thing which is before us ultimately under the Commerce Clause when we test a North Carolina statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="372.332" offset="1590295">May it please Your Honor, I believe that the District Court misread the Warth case and others because, there we were referring to associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.348" offset="1626344">This is not an association.</text>

            <text syncTime="387.938" offset="1652675">Not a single grower in the State of Washington has any option about this matter whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.820" offset="1672215">He is assessed and he pays and the Commission then spends his money to advertise his apples.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.761" offset="1700009">He cannot refuse to join, may it please Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.474" offset="1710876">He is an individual who pays the Commission to do this but there is nothing which disqualifies him, if he is injured by the North Carolina statute from bringing an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.423" offset="1758628">Certainly if his injury exceeds $10,000, he could bring it in the Federal Court, if it does not, he could bring it in the State Court.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="422.679" stopTime="431.942">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="422.679" offset="1791647">But would you say that this state agency does not perform substantially the same functions as trade association?</text>

            <text syncTime="433.880" offset="1836473">Its principal function is advertising and if you would look at the complaint, even in its amended form with the second bite at the cherry.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.645" offset="1875552">All that Washington State contends that the Washington State Advertising Commission does in the State of North Carolina is advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.978" offset="1908884">They say we spend $25,000 in advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.702" offset="1919751">Well there is nothing in the North Carolina statute which says you cannot advertise.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.152" offset="1937515">Every carton coming into North Carolina can display in the largest possible word it, “Washington State Apples”, and indeed at hearings before the North Carolina Advertising Commission, we showed that, that was being done and we have no objection to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.897" offset="2000522">We welcome that advertising that they were grown in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.746" offset="2015986">What we are saying through is to put the Washington State grade on the carton, on their closed containers is offensive to the North Carolina statute because within the police power the General Assembly of North Carolina found that there was confusion in the marketplace.</text>

            <text syncTime="507.324" offset="2130298">The Linda case in 1973 which is cited to this Court so often, reaffirmed the requirement that a party seeking review must itself have suffered an injury and when the constitutionality of a statute is attacked, then the party invoking jurisdictional power must show that it has sustained direct injury as a result of the statute enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.451" offset="2226742">There, both the Sierra Club case and the Warth case say that it must appear in the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="934.064" offset="3837244">The Court did not go along with the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.508" offset="3855007">Now, I would like to point out that because it is very important part of this case, Mr. Bramley’s (ph) affidavit on Pages 103, 107 of the Appendix inadvertently misstates the genesis of the North Carolina law.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.740" offset="3923866">Now, actually it was passed in 1971, two years before this controversy began, not in response to the appearance of the Washington State Apple Advertising Commission before the North Carolina Board of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.413" offset="4002651">It was in 1973 that the change was made because of the constant and persistent refusal of the State of Washington to obey the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.299" offset="4046119">Every other apple growing state shipping into North Carolina was obeying the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.103" offset="4065345">Then, so the 1973 session of the State added the words that it would be the exclusive marking whether they were North Carolina apples, Washington apples, Virginia apples and of course, we have no greater competitor in North Carolina than these delicious Virginia apples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.129" offset="4141518">But North Carolina did not change the rules after the controversy began.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.031" offset="4161058">No, indeed, but Washington did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.207" offset="4173805">It went in and changed its grades and up them to the equivalent Unites States grades.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.739" offset="4199928">Now, the harsh fact is that should they prevail here today, they can go back to Washington and change those, lower those grades, change them back to what they were before.</text>

            <text syncTime="1062.975" offset="4352901">On jurisdictional amount the only specific allegation in the complaint, and again, I refer to the insistence of this Court that this would be determined from the allegations in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.047" offset="4405146">This is again in Sierra Club; this is in Warth, and the only thing you find out is the $25,000 spent on behalf of the commission in advertising in the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.407" offset="4454569">Well, they are welcome to continue to advertise in the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.168" offset="4469616">There is no prohibition on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.053" offset="4481214">So, they have to then go to the question of aggregation of claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.383" offset="4502530">We find no case precisely in point and that is not surprising but there are analogous cases, the Zahn case which we cite involves four property owners claiming injury by water pollution caused by paper company, and in this Court here that claims could not be aggregated to provide the $10,000 you see.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.406" offset="4594586">If that is true, every single marketing association in North Carolina could have ten growers coming into the Federal Courts, I say, in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.879" offset="4640457">In the nation and there must be tens of thousands of them coming into the Federal Courts and in saying, “I am injured, $1,000.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.032" offset="4673058">Ten of them, that’s $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.608" offset="4683402">These are matters which this Court has persistently said should be treated in the State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.621" offset="4707435">There is an interesting contradiction in what the District Court did in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.543" offset="4731154">The Bramley affidavit, which appears on Page 17 of the Appendix, attempts to meet the jurisdictional requirement which was not in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.959" offset="4760829">It is just not there, but they say that the requirement -- they estimate that it costs from 5 to 15 cents a box to obliterate the Washington State grade from what they allege a pre-printed container.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.255" offset="4833972">Now, the evidence is in dispute on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.706" offset="4843794">There is an affidavit to the contrary there as to whether they are all pre-printed or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.325" offset="4862289">But in any event the District Court accepted this and Mr. Justice Marshall it was referred to by Judge Dupree and Judge Craven who wrote for the Three-Judge Court specifically put it in his Footnote 9 in great details.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.852" offset="4916310">Obviously the Court felt that this was the basis for the jurisdictional amount, but what did the Court do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.997" offset="4952986">The Court struck down the requirement which put the Washington growers to this expense what left intact the requirement that they show the U.S. grade that mathematically obviously one cancels out the other and you are left with a zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.674" offset="5031666">Now, our point Is that if you cannot aggregate there is absolutely no way to reach the jurisdictional point, the jurisdictional amount in a representative capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.946" offset="5100734">May I speak very quickly on the merits, I would like to remind the Court that less than 1% of the Washington production is involved -- less than 1% of the Washington apples shipped involved in this case, and that must be considerably less then 1% of the total production. Now, that is the backdrop for the exercise or the application of the balancing theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.840" offset="5232287">Now, there was the case in the 30’s Justice Brandeis speaking for the Court held that if was proper for Oregon to request standard containers for raspberries and strawberries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.336" offset="5298324">Obviously, the state shippers were required to go to the expense of using a different container from that permitted by other state than Oregon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.127" offset="5333433">MR. Justice Brandeis pointed out, and let me say with candid, he distinguished, he used some language which distinguished that opinion from the opinion that we seek in this case, because he said that the plaintiff was a manufacturer of grapes, it was not a grower nor produce, there is that difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.997" offset="5412950">He went on to say that actually probably in a state commerce is got involved because the real crux of what we are talking about here is intrastate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.429" offset="5450671">But Mr. Justice Brandeis went on the point at one factual that comes home in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.565" offset="5479196">He said “There are 34 other styles or shapes of berry baskets in use somewhere in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.291" offset="5518066">Obviously a multitude of shapes and sizes of packages tends to confuse the buyers.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.768" offset="5552026">And then he specifically applied the police power test to that kind of factual situation and he said the order here in question deals with a subject clearly within the scope of the police power when such legislative action is called in question if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it there is a presumption of existence of that state of facts and one who assails in the classification must carry the burden of showing by resort the common knowledge or other matters which may be judicially noticed or other legitimate proof that the action is arbitrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.962" offset="5696849">This record shows the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.364" offset="5706357">This record shows that since the North Carolina statute was passed, the qualities of apples coming into North Carolina have improved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.197" offset="5737704">This record shows that United States Department of Agriculture conducting an independent survey of the apple industry from one ocean to the other found that what North Carolina had done had had a salutary effect and recommended that every apple growing state do the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.213" offset="5817848">The General Assembly of North Carolina hearing witnesses from the apple industry enacted the statute within the exercise of its police power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.487" offset="5858912">There is an affidavit in this Appendix from a gentleman whose name, if I recall is Barba (ph) who has been in the apple business for 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1448.274" offset="5894021">He pointed out that the use of multiple grades was not only confined to what appears on the container, on the close container but that apples are sold by pricelist which are circulated, I believe, by telegram or by wire or electronically in some way, and that when all of these different grades appear on that list, and that when multiple grades and a federal interstate grade both appear on that list, it is confusing to the buyers and that prices are depressed in this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.627" offset="6039471">Now, it has been chosen that in North Carolina the grower that since 1971 have been using the United States grade only.</text>

            <text syncTime="1505.748" offset="6123898">That is in this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.733" offset="6131840">What it seeks to do in that time, and no other state significantly raises any protest.</text>

            <text syncTime="1733.840" offset="7036303">I would like to sum up with just one word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.559" offset="7051141">We feel that ultimately the principle thrust of the Apple Commission’s position is that the North Carolina statute does not meet the balance of interest test, that is, that for a state regulation to be constitutional its benefits must outweigh the burden on it and the state commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.169" offset="7121671">In this context the whole core of this case can be considerably restricted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.204" offset="7141733">It boils down that whether the desire of a given state to advertise its state grade on less than 1% of its total volume of apple shipped outweighs the exercise of the police power of the State of North Carolina through its General Assembly, when the records shows that while the statute was in effect the quality of apple shipped in the North Carolina improved, the confusion was eliminated, and that the State’s action received a laudatory recommendation of experts surveying such matters for the US Department Of Agriculture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.571" offset="7271196">When the balancing test is applied to these facts we respectfully submit that the action of the General Assembly should prevail.</text>

            <text syncTime="1810.114" offset="7341413">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.588" offset="7355311">The production and sale of apples has played a major role in the economy of the State of Washington for many decades.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.703" offset="7391778">As a result the State itself has shown a considerable interest in the apple business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.222" offset="7417795">Some 60 years ago Washington was the first jurisdiction in the United States to promulgate apple grades, anticipating the federal grading system by some 15 years, but there are several even more vital distinctions between the two grading systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1849.225" offset="7497835">The federal system is optional only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.721" offset="7511836">The apple packer may choose to use it or to ignore it without penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.546" offset="7539108">The Washington state system on the other hand is mandatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.199" offset="7557707">No apples maybe packed or shipped in or from the State of Washington unless they have been graded and unless the grade is marked on the container.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.546" offset="7603160">The federal grading system permits and packer himself to grade his own apples, subject only to someone’s later challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.809" offset="7644225">The Washington state system on the other hand mandates grading by independently employed inspectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.090" offset="7681319">In summary, the federal system requires neither grading nor inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.787" offset="7704098">The Washington state system requires both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.669" offset="7719666">The US Department of Agriculture therefore has explicitly declined to preempt the field of apple grading or inspection and no issue of preemption is involved in this case whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1918.782" offset="7776091">While some 36 states, not 13 Mr. Justice Stewart, grow apples in commercial quantities, 30% of all of the apples grown in the United States are grown in Washington and the 50% of all fresh apples sold in interstate commerce in closed containers originate in the State of Washington, in fact, on one relatively small portion of the state, on the East Slope of the Cascade Mountains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.676" offset="7887686">As a result of this combination of facts, a number of developments in the apple business were either illogical or almost inevitable or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.992" offset="7928960">In our State one such development was a detailed and careful state regulation of the apple business to ensure the quality and the reputation of Washington apples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.973" offset="7976816">That regulation includes our mandatory grading and inspection system and a state grading system, which is more rigorous with the top Washington grades, extra fancy and fancy, deny the comparable voluntary federal grades.</text>
            <text syncTime="1984.084" offset="8037315">In addition, Washington is the only state in which there is extensive use of what is called the controlled atmosphere storage, the system permitting a year round supply of fresh apples from one harvest to the next.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.833" offset="8088306">Obviously such a regulatory system assures quality at a relatively high price to which is added the punishingly high costs of transportation to markets thousands of miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.306" offset="8146194">Nevertheless Washington apples compete successfully with the local product even in the east and in the south.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.876" offset="8176496">As a matter of fact that competition is too intense for the taste of the apple growers of North Carolina and that is really why we are here today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2042.082" offset="8269283">In 1973, the North Carolina Legislature not only banned but made criminal the use of grades other than U.S. grades on closed containers of apples shipped to or sold in that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.951" offset="8320796">A year later, on our protest, the North Carolina Commissioner Of Agriculture wrote us and said, “I naturally want to have the sentiment from our apple producers on the change in the law since they were mainly responsible for this legislation being passed.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.380" offset="8394462">Quite obviously we obtained no relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.444" offset="8406687">Now, the North Carolina statute contains a number of interesting and relevant features.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.424" offset="8426644">First, the statute does not require any apples shipped to or sold in the state to be either graded or inspected at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.228" offset="8465828">Second, the statute does not apply to any fruit product other than apples, though many other fruits are the subject to state grading systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.526" offset="8503026">Third, state grades may continue to be used on open containers of apples.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.677" offset="8523611">The Washington apples, by virtue of their storage and the distance from which they come, are all shipped to North Carolina in closed containers, but Mr. Justice Stewart we have made a misstatement on Pages 16 and 17 of our brief, in stating that all North Carolina apples are sold in open containers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.894" offset="8596545">Some are and some are not and fourth, state grades may not be used on closed containers of apples in North Carolina even though the U.S. grade is also shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.898" offset="8648581">Thus, all Washington apples sold in North Carolina will be graded; other apples may not be graded at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.105" offset="8685361">The North Carolina statute has substantially disrupted the Washington apple business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.100" offset="8705319">For some time most Washington apple containers have been preprinted with the prominent display of grade in order to facilitate not only there handling and storage but their sale as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.787" offset="8752130">Now, Washington producers have four choices, all unpleasant: First, a manual obliteration of the Washington grade from each container which might possibly be shipped to North Carolina, a mutilation which detracts from its appearance and raises questions about the quality of the contents to all who see it, and this at a cost between five and 15 cents a box or as much as $72,000 a year for boxes bound to North Carolina alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.623" offset="8875428">Now, while the North Carolina trade takes only 1% of the Washington apple crop that involves some $2 million worth of apples and our shippers simply cannot determine in advance which 1% will eventually go to that state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.340" offset="8938331">So their second alternative is to eliminate preprinted boxes entirely and hand stamp manually the grade on each box, as it is utilized at an obvious increase in cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2221.658" offset="8987546">Thirdly, of course, they can abandon the North Carolina market, or fourth they can abandon that historic grading system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2379.201" offset="9617724">In any event the affidavits which are found in the Appendix to this case which talk of confusion are all from people in the apple growing or selling business in North Carolina who do not deal in out-of-state apples at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.539" offset="9683134">All of the evidence in the record from those who do deal in out-of-state apples even in North Carolina want to be able to use and they have the Washington State grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.927" offset="9732662">So, the effect of this system has been added cost to Washington sellers and the North Carolina consumers, because of this cost some refusals by Washington apple producers to sell to North Carolina buyers and some refusals -- and this is in the record and undisputed -- by North Carolina purchasers to purchase Washington apples.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.097" offset="9817299">The Commission itself has been frustrated in its duty to enhance the market for Washington apples and in an advertising program which since it obviously can not emphasize price leads to speak to the quality of the apples concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.766" offset="9888039">But, North Carolina consumer who must pay more receives less because of practical Washington packer who can not use the higher State grade is likely to shift apples to North Carolina which meet only the U.S. grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.637" offset="9943523">The North Carolina wholesaler or retailer, who wants the highest grade of Washington apples, is now denied to this grade information at least as a representation on the container in which the apples receive, and it makes it more difficult for him to get what he wants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.908" offset="10012591">The only economic group which gains is the North Carolina grower, who spawned the statute in the first place and he gains by lessening his competition. =</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.892" offset="10060551">This Court has consistently ruled that while a state may regulate commerce to protect the health or safety or its citizens from fraud even though there maybe some effect under the state commerce, it has a lack of power to retire the burden or constrict the flow of commerce simply for the economic advantage of the people within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.932" offset="10160653">The Court has been particularly careful in scrutinizing restrictions placed on imported food products which compete with those produced locally, in validating a whole series of such restrictions on commerce in Meek and Milk cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.590" offset="10219271">It permits state restrictions under the state commerce only when the state’s interest in its citizen’s health or safety or the prevention of fraud or usurpation outweighs the adverse effect on commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.951" offset="10264724">It will permit a producing state to enhance the reputation and quality of its agricultural product, but not where commerce is seriously burdened simply into increased local employment or only incidental lead to benefit its reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.350" offset="10322298">Here we have a regulation, which costs consumer’s money, deprives wholesalers and retailers of desired information, and all of the people in the business whose testimony is in this record indicate that add works to the deferment of out-of-state businesses as well as businesses in North Carolina who deal in apples at wholesale or retail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2578.415" offset="10414563">The Regulation is unique as well as dubious and it seems to us falls within several of your prohibitions perhaps most particularly Bibb v. Navajo Freight Lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.269" offset="10458031">And a final and added vies to the North Carolina scheme is that it establishes no standard for apples at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.563" offset="10491154">It simply prevents the use of someone else’s standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.082" offset="10509231">Now, North Carolina asserts that the Commission lacks standing to challenge its statute either on its own behalf or as a representative of Washington apple producers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.879" offset="10556460">You have most clearly set these requirements out in Warth v. Seldin and just a month ago in Boston Stock Exchange v. State Tax Commission, as follows: The association may have standing in its own right to seek judicial relief from injury to itself and to vindicate whatever rights and immunities the association itself may enjoy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.502" offset="10646948">Even in the absence of injury to itself, when association may have standing solely as the representative of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.959" offset="10676832">The association must allege that its members or any of them or any one of them are suffering immediate of threatened injury as a result of the challenged action of the sort that would make out a justiciable case had the members themselves brought suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.466" offset="10730853">But even apart from this, whether an association has standing to invoke the Court’s remedial powers on behalf of its members, depends on substantial measure on the nature of the relief sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.855" offset="10776411">If in a proper case the association seeks a declaration, injunction, or some other form of prospective relief, this is exactly what we sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.409" offset="10806609">It can reasonably be supposed that the remedy, if granted, will inherit of the benefit of those members of the association actually injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.385" offset="10842449">Now, the Commission in the State of Washington was created to engage in research for the use and improvement of apples, to advertise for those apples, to educate the public about its grades and to stabilize and protect the apple industry of the State of Washington and to expand its markets.</text>

            <text syncTime="3527.838" offset="14212349">In summary, it seems, both from your questions and from the argument of the opposing counsel, there is little question here as to the interference in commerce of the particular proposal of a particular statute which the State of North Carolina has passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.636" offset="14283506">It quite obviously falls within the consistence ban the State has had and this Court has placed on in the state producers affecting commerce simply for the benefit of those producers, even though they set forth some kind of guides of the protection of the consumer or the health and safety of the people of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.097" offset="14377338">The problem of standing can be resolved either by treating the Washington State apple Advertising Commission itself as the sole party in an unrepresentative nature in the State but permitting it to deal with the losses, to the business in which it is solely engaged or by reason of its own advertising budget in the State of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.056" offset="14497188">Alternatively, it can be treated appropriately as an association since a decision here would affect all of the growers and all of the shippers in the State of Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="3608.381" offset="14534491">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
