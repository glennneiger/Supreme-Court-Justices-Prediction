            <label>Mr. James O. Latturner</label>
            <text syncTime="8.313" offset="133783">Good morning, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.393" offset="158024">In order to fully and adequately understand the Secretary of State's action in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.559" offset="182788">It is necessary for a full consideration of the entire statutory and regulatory scheme set up by the State of Illinois and under which the Secretary of State Acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.269" offset="233571">Illinois provides two basic statutory sections regarding the revocation of driver?s licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.068" offset="264813">They are found in the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.971" offset="276411">The first Section 6-205 and the second Section 6-206.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.242" offset="301489">The Secretary acted under Section 6-206 which provides for the discretionary revocation or suspension of driver?s licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.070" offset="344748">For comparison, I would first like to consider Section 6-205.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.118" offset="372960">Section 6-205 is clearly headed mandatory revocation of driver?s license and provides that the Secretary Of State shall forthwith revoke a driver?s license upon receiving the report of the conviction of various traffic crimes, such as drunken driving, three instances of reckless driving and various others.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.942" offset="472225">Not only is his action mandatory, but at the end of the Traffic Court proceeding where these convictions take place, the licensee must surrender his driver?s license to the clerk or the judge of that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.692" offset="531262">The clerk or judge in turn forwards the license to the Secretary of State who now needs only to stamp it revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.708" offset="567311">The Secretary of State must revoke it. He has no discretion to take any other action on that license.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.516" offset="602524">In start contrast to this mandatory revocation provision, we have Section 6-206.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.878" offset="631990">This is the provision which the Secretary of State acted under the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.134" offset="652993">This is clearly headed discretionary authority to suspend or revoke licenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.163" offset="677130">It gives the Secretary of State, the authority to revoke licenses upon the happening of the determination, certain events have happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.707" offset="719344">In this particular case, Mr. Love?s license was revoked as stated in the notice, because his driving record indicated a disrespect for the traffic laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.384" offset="766051">Other discretionary revocations under Section 6-206 even include non-feloniously violating any provision of the Motor Vehicle Code.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.834" offset="1435830">The licensee may then file a written request for a hearing under Section 2-118.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.619" offset="1462997">The Secretary of State does not have to respond to that request for 20 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.679" offset="1483268">They have 20 days to respond to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.218" offset="1493404">When they respond to it, the response is to set a date further into the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.837" offset="1515869">Beyond the 20 days, there is no statutory provision for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.242" offset="1533424">It is supposed to be within a reasonable time.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.908" offset="1548157">After the hearing is set, it is held, there is then the time for decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.611" offset="1574906">During this entire process, the license is revoked.</text>

            <text syncTime="376.124" offset="1604999">As we have indicated again in the abstracts, our experiences on administrative proceedings before the Secretary of State regarding driver?s licenses, the process from the time of the request to the time of decision runs anywhere from three?and-a-half months to over nine months.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.051" offset="1684725">During this time, the license is revoked.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.083" offset="1696846">There is no prompt hearing, there is nothing that can be done prior to the effective date of the revocation to save the license.</text>

            <label>Mr. James O. Latturner</label>
            <text syncTime="414.879" offset="1760062">Yes, the Hardship License is a part of the 2-118 hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.129" offset="1785035">We got a special one in this case, because after filing the action, the revocation was stayed pending a hearing on hardship which the District Court ordered separate and apart from a regular 2-118 hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.867" offset="1855984">It took them a month-and-a-half to make that decision from June 10th until July 25th.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.251" offset="1897466">Going back again to the statutory scheme under Section 6-206, as I have indicated is purely discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.141" offset="1937068">The rules which the Secretary of State has promulgated reinforced this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.277" offset="1965593">Rule 6-206 clearly states that the Secretary is authorized to take action or he may decline to act in contrast to Section 205, where he must act.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.926" offset="2024212">Here he has the discretion, even if grounds exist for some reason not to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.374" offset="2053992">The statute Section 6-206 further provides that if he chooses to act, even if a penalty of revocation is authorized, he may substitute an order of suspension instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.532" offset="2110625">So again, rather than a definite penalty that must be imposed, he has the discretion to lower it if he wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.053" offset="2152735">The Secretary of State has argued that despite this admitted discretion, they avoid all discretionary decisions by the adoption of a Point System, but the Point System also must be viewed in accordance with statutory and regulatory system within Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.880" offset="2252000">The Point System is provided for under Section 6-204 of the Illinois Motor Vehicle Code, where they talk about traffic violations and that Section refers to findings of guilty on traffic violations as evidence relating to unfitness to safely operate a motor vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.296" offset="2345727">The rule which the Secretary of State has promulgated Section 6-204 which includes the point system, specifically provides that he shall promulgate a Point System as a standard in determining whether to suspend or revoke licenses and further that the Point System shall act as a standard for the Secretary in determining whether such person has due respect for the Traffic Laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.953" offset="2460353">Thus, we find that the Point System is not conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.265" offset="2481564">It is merely evidence, it is merely a starting point, a guide.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.734" offset="2503402">The Secretary of State claims that is the only thing they consider that is true, because they will not allow the licensee to make any presentation of other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.015" offset="2556588">That is not an excuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.150" offset="2565051">That is actually a statement of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.400" offset="2578113">What we need when the Secretary of State is considering some evidence, the traffic record, the right of the other person to the proceeding, the licensee to be allowed to present what evidence he has in order that there may be a weighing of all the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.221" offset="2649375">There is no possibility whatsoever for the licensee to make any presentation prior to the effective date of the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.324" offset="2697753">They claim that after the traffic -- that there was a prior hearing in Traffic Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.921" offset="2724189">Again, looking at the statutory scheme, the decision that is made in Traffic Court under Section 6-206 is not conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.193" offset="2765254">Remember, the decision made in traffic court under Section 6-205, a separate Section is conclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.113" offset="2796914">The license is surrendered in the Traffic Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.558" offset="2810707">Under Section 6-206, however, it is clearly contemplated that the Secretary of State has other decisions to make, decisions which are not determined by the Traffic Court Judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.138" offset="2865042">First, the Secretary of State has to decide whether or not grounds to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.719" offset="2887402">As the District Court found, he has to make an affirmative determination that in fact there is disrespect for the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.749" offset="2923451">The Traffic Court only decides single convictions.</text>

            <text syncTime="721.283" offset="2985623">If they put that into the Section 6-205 scheme, that would be an entirely different case and I think that with the surrender of the license in Traffic Court that it would meet Due Process, otherwise Lower Court cases that the Secretary Act, there would have to be a hearing in clerical error.</text>
