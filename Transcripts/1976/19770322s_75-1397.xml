            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100529">The judgment and opinion of the Court in 75-1397, Juidice against Vail will be announced by Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="10.326" offset="141802">Appellees in this case are New York judgment debtors.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.923" offset="164163">When they failed to pay the judgments, their creditors subpoenaed them to appear for supplemental proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.971" offset="196346">The notices informed the debtors that failure to comply was punishable by contempt of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.703" offset="223305">When the appellees did not comply with these notices, the appellants who are state judges in New York, issued orders requiring them to appear in court to show cause why they should not be held in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.930" offset="280147">Appellees again failed to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.108" offset="292895">Appellees were then held in contempt in order to pay fines.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.297" offset="309613">When they failed to pay the fines, the appellant judges issued ex parte commitment orders and the debtors were jailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.977" offset="344408">At this point, the debtors brought suit in the United States District Court seeking to enjoin the statutory contempt procedures used by New York on the grounds that the procedures used leading to imprisonment for contempt of court violated the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.812" offset="415775">The three-judge district court, after deciding that it should not abstain, declared the challenge sections of the New York judiciary law to be unconstitutional and enjoined their enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.123" offset="472931">For the reasons given and an opinion filed today with the clerk, we reversed the judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.271" offset="501561">We hold that because of the availability of the pending stay judicial proceedings in which the constitutional issues could have been raised, it was error for the Federal Court to enjoin the enforcement of these state statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.152" offset="557045">We conclude that the principles of comity and federalism discussed in our decisions in Younger against Harris, and Huffman versus Pursue, are applicable to constitutional challenges to state contempt procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.348" offset="617858">The State's interest in the contempt process through which it vindicates the regular operation of its judicial system has an important interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.692" offset="655265">The District Court was wrong in deciding that Younger and Huffman were not applicable when these procedures were challenged and its judgment is accordingly reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.577" offset="702808">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring and the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.183" offset="721198">Mr. Justice Brennan joined by Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.077" offset="744813">Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
