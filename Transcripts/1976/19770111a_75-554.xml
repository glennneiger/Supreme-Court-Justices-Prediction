            <text syncTime="68.205" offset="373572">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.045" offset="388932">In 1965, Congress enacted Title IX of the Social Security Act, which is commonly better referred to as Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.057" offset="421011">The general purpose of that statute was to provide necessary medical services for the indigent, near indigent as maybe determined by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.308" offset="462075">It was an optional program on the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.027" offset="472942">The primary or premium medical judgment of the physician was of course the primary fact to determine which services should be reimbursed and which should not.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.882" offset="520381">It was left up to the States whether or not the recipients or the providers would be reimbursed for their services.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.421" offset="542532">There are general requirements in the statute that require equality of treatment for the various groups that are covered within a program and there are general descriptions of the types of services that are required.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.493" offset="594777">There are five basic categories of services which cover such things as inpatient services, outpatient services, skilled nursing services, physician services and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.956" offset="628632">Pennsylvania opted to participate in this program and accordingly drew up a plan, a Medicaid plan, which was submitted to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare and approved by that department.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.352" offset="678160">The plan again, consistent with Title XIX places primary reliance on the physician?s judgment as to which services in the covered categories would be necessary and required, as required also by the Federal Statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.263" offset="737824">Pennsylvania has a Utilization Review Program which reviews the use of services to make sure that unnecessary services are not being dispensed and reimbursed under the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.716" offset="783695">As part of the program, Pennsylvania covers pregnancy related medical services, including abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.255" offset="817863">However, each such service must be medically necessary at the time of its utilization.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.944" offset="836567">This is the controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.440" offset="842523">This is where the controversy arises in Pennsylvania and, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.832" offset="856106">Pennsylvania?s abortion policy basically requires that at the time abortion service is rendered, it would be medically necessary in the judgment of the physician, that is that the condition for which the abortion is prescribed threatens the health or the life of the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.192" offset="933533">There is also a two-doctor concurrence and the requirement that the abortion be performed in J.C.A.H. accredited hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.315" offset="966030">Those two requirements were never litigated in earnest in this case and it is quite reasonable with respect to the two-doctor concurrence because that I am told in practice is rather a rubber stamp.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.796" offset="1024021">In any event?</text>

            <text syncTime="234.618" offset="1039277">Was it litigated at all?</text>

            <label>Mr. Norman J. Watkins</label>
            <text syncTime="236.063" offset="1045024">It was raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.830" offset="1048158">It was challenged in the original complaint Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.025" offset="1060906">However, the decision of the District Court and the decisions of the Court of Appeals did not discuss these issues and their lack of compliance with respect to Title XIX or the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.599" offset="1119212">The plaintiffs in this case were all pregnant women with pregnancies ranging, I believe, from seven to 17 weeks term.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.020" offset="1164874">By their own admission, at least some of the plaintiffs in affidavits filed and contained in the joint appendix, some of the women sought their abortion for reasons totally unrelated to health.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.166" offset="1209491">In fact, the stipulation of counsel filed in this case so states.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.533" offset="1226941">Accordingly, these women were not able to procure the required certification of medical necessity from the attending physician or two other physicians, and therefore, they were unable to receive the abortion because they were indigent, they were unable to provide the funds to procure the abortion on their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.966" offset="1300710">Thus, this lawsuit was filed challenging these Medicaid Regulations on both statutory basis and on the constitutional basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.857" offset="1332266">This record held that Pennsylvania?s medical necessity requirements applied to abortion does not violate Title XIX, but rather the Court went on quite properly and decided that, under The Constitution, in its view, with one judge dissenting, the regulation violated the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.432" offset="1410529">The Court of Appeals on bunk affectively reversed that holding of the Lower Court and found that Pennsylvania?s Medicaid Regulations as applied to abortion violate Title XIX of the Social Security Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.352" offset="1470193">It did not go to the constitutional question under this Court?s teaching in Higgins vs. Levine.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.388" offset="1498405">There are, in my view, at least seven compelling reasons why this holding of the Court of Appeals on bunk must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.929" offset="1528498">First, as the Court was well aware, in 1965, when Title XIX was inactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.612" offset="1555247">Non-therapeutic and I might say at outset that I am using the terms, Non-therapeutic medically unnecessary interchangeably, I do not see any distinction between the two nor the Court of Appeals, nor?</text>

            <text syncTime="393.310" offset="1674052">And, there is nothing in the record in this case to indicate to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="399.786" offset="1699966">Well, it is not a concession at all Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.958" offset="1708638">The 1970 policy of the Pennsylvanian Medical Society which formed the basis for our regulations, in fact points out that both psychological or physical health reasons certainly should be taken into account by the physician in determining the necessity of an abortion and as well, I might say the physicians in Pennsylvania, like every other state are certainly bound by the pronouncements of this Court and the teachings of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.457" offset="1810621">Pennsylvania certainly realizes that it could not restrict the physician?s judgment to any narrower scope than this Court pronounced.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.905" offset="1880420">Let me make perfectly clear, my concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.783" offset="1891914">That is that a physician, in examining a patient, may take psychological, physical, emotional, familial considerations into mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.670" offset="1935486">And, in the light of those considerations, might determine if those factors affect the health of the mother to such an extent as he would deem an abortion necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.699" offset="1975610">I think, the key in the Bolton language and the key in the voice language is the fact that the physician, using all of these factors, and there are probably more that he should use, must determine if the woman?s health, that is her physical or psychological health, is jeopardized by the condition of pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.437" offset="2042588">That is not to say, obviously, as I believe the plan is to assert that the fact that the family is going to increase makes an abortion medically necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.268" offset="2077905">If that were the case and if that is what this Court meant then I would say that, what we are really saying is that the only medically unnecessary abortion is when the woman is not pregnant and I do not believe that this Court was reaching that resolve in Voich or Bolton.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.084" offset="2141122">Certainly?</text>

            <text syncTime="881.197" offset="3625608">As I pointed out a non-therapeutic abortion in 31 States, at least in 1965 was in fact illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.997" offset="3660821">It is difficult for me to imagine that Congress would have mandated and we got to keep that in mind that the plaintiffs, the respondents in this case are arguing that not only this Title XIX allows reimbursement for non-therapeutic abortions, but in fact it requires it.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.709" offset="3727590">It is difficult for me to conceive that Congress would have required States to fund a procedure that was in fact illegal on the vast majority of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.551" offset="3763012">Secondly, Title XIX itself makes no mention whatsoever of abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.714" offset="3779626">Couple that with the fact that, every time save one, every time that Congress has addressed this issue, it has in one way or another expressed its clear displeasure with non-therapeutic abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.985" offset="3836782">The save one is the possible removal of the prohibition against funding of abortions as a family planning device, but there has never been an affirmative expression or approval by Congress of non-therapeutic abortions or funding thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.008" offset="3904805">Next and fourth I believe this is, every other circuit Court that I am aware of that has addressed this issue has gone contrary to the certain circuit on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.190" offset="3945556">Fifth, Pennsylvania?s medical necessity requirement and I have already eluted to this, is entirely reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.008" offset="3968857">There can be nothing more reasonable in my view than in a medical services program relying on the judgment of the physician to determine which services are reasonable, which services are necessary and which services are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.212" offset="4025700">Sixth, the Lower Court?s reasoning which basically relies on two points is faulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.183" offset="4053494">First, the Court held that the medical necessity requirement interferes with the judgment of the physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.650" offset="4079407">Well, we have discussed this already.</text>

            <text syncTime="1099.913" offset="4500501">If it is, then we want to know from the physician, despite this request, in your judgment, is this procedure necessary?</text>

            <text syncTime="1120.774" offset="4583884">Secondly, the Court held that our medical necessity requirement violates the general broad equality positions of Title XIX.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.225" offset="4633726">Now, I have examined that reasoning very closely and all that can be set forth is that they have pointed to no instance in Pennsylvania where the medical necessity requirement is not applied and in fact, if the Lower Court?s opinion is to stand, what will be created is a situation where the woman who requires an abortion for non-medical reasons will be treated differently than all other medical assistance recipients in Pennsylvania because she will be entitled to reimbursement for a procedure non-medically necessary where no others would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.772" offset="4771861">The final reason that I am convinced that the Lower Court?s opinion must be reversed is the fact that respondents themselves have conceded that a medical necessity requirement is in fact permissible under Title XIX.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.068" offset="4841034">I have addressed this in my reply brief.</text>

            <text syncTime="1212.642" offset="4951375">The fact of the matter is and we have discussed this quite line, Pennsylvania, as early as 1970, recognized that, and in fact, has no intention to interfere with the exercise of that physician?s judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.651" offset="6071401">The reason to me is entirely reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1499.864" offset="6100240">Pennsylvania places a premium on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.154" offset="6109435">Pennsylvania does not place a premium on the physician?s recommendations of how to provide a better economic or social environment for that particular family.</text>

            <text syncTime="1516.039" offset="6164919">Thus, if the physician, at any stage in the pregnancy says abortion is necessary, it is paid for or any other service, it is paid for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.473" offset="6198670">In fact, if the woman came in and demanded delivery services before the physician said they were necessary, they would not be paid for either.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.174" offset="6237540">Is the question, who is requesting the service, who determines whether it is necessary?</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.509" offset="6286859">The problem with the Lower Court?s analysis is that if it is extrapolated, it would be very difficult to cap it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.896" offset="6324371">If you determine that it is a condition that determines medical necessity, you really have taken the physician out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.946" offset="6352583">You have taken the physician out of the program thus Pennsylvania can list 30 or 40 conditions and that is it, any service that any physician will perform for that condition, be it an accurate dispensation of services or not, Pennsylvania must be required to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.632" offset="6427293">We consider that error and we request this Court to reverse the opinion of the Third Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1661.878" offset="6748286">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.303" offset="6766049">The Court has today before it in Title XIX, what the Second Circuit has otherwise described as a long and complicated statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.044" offset="6805024">Given the complexity of the statute, respondents submit that the statute is certainly capable of various judicial approaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.647" offset="6839401">The approach which respondents presented to the Court in our brief attempts to take an account the traditional roles of all the participants necessary for the delivery of medical services to the indigent, that is the State, the provider of services and the recipient of the services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.975" offset="6928740">Keeping that distinction in mind, as we go through the argument, I think, it is important to keep in mind the distinction between state attempts to eliminate a broad condition and state attempts to limit a physician?s choice of alternative treatments for a given condition because as we see with the situation of pregnancy and the alternative treatments for that condition that the realm of the physician?s discretion which my brother at the bar, Mr. Watkins suggested he was not trying to interfere with, is in fact being interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.737" offset="7107731">What respondents have done is looked to Section 1396-AA-17 of the Act which requires mandates upon the States that they include reasonable standards for determining the extent of medical assistance and that those standards must be consistent with the purposes of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.836" offset="7188188">What respondents extrapolate from that language is that the State must have some rational reason when they begin to eliminate services from coverage under the Medicaid Program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2541.652" offset="10267398">I think, it is very important, given the section of the Act that we are going under to understand that what we submit the State is putting up a smokescreen almost in terms of the language and medical necessity and they cannot as we are to the brief that medical necessity in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.810" offset="10336047">It is not sufficient under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.068" offset="10345034">That is normally medical necessity consideration for furthering other interests such as fiscal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.788" offset="10363946">I can, very quickly at this time perhaps diverge from a normal pattern here and get back and take a quick look that some of the considerations that Mr. Watkins raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.279" offset="10405951">For example, he talked about the illegality of abortions in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.068" offset="10429043">I would refer the Court, in terms of legislative history, to the House report number 213, the 89th Congress, 1965, page 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="2591.892" offset="10468332">Now, that house report was talking about Title XVIII Medicare, but as many other Courts have recognized, the legislative history can be read somewhat correctively and there, they specifically stated that in terms of the extent of services that they intended to include new services as they were adopted in the future, indicating the breadth of what Congress intended in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.475" offset="10566656">I would also refer the Court to the drug example of the Lower Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.663" offset="10579404">When they were talking about (Inaudible) new drugs became marketable that they could not read the statute as requiring them to be prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.930" offset="10608557">Also, I would suggest that in 1972, not 1965, when Congress amended the Social Security Act to include family planning services that they were aware at that time the H.E.W considered abortion to be part of comprehensive system of family planning services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.169" offset="10681491">There again, when they were specific using the term family planning services, indication of their intent to include abortion and finally I would refer the Court to the case of the United States versus Southeast Underwriter?s Association a 322 U.S. 533 where the Court realized the expansive nature of the Sherman Antitrust Act and that is exactly what we are saying is involved here in terms of allowing for new services as they are developed in the future, meaning of course, whether or not they are legally developed in the future or medically developed in the future as they become an accepted legitimate professional service.</text>

            <text syncTime="2698.317" offset="10894023">What Mr. Watkins raised in terms of the lack of specific language in Title XIX, respondents would submit that, as we have pointed out before, that the Second Circuit described it as the long and complicated statute and they did not really have mentioned any specific service and there is no reason to have expected them to specifically refer to abortion services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.094" offset="10977197">However, we would also submit, in terms of the specificity argument, that again, the term family planning services when it was added to the Act in 1972, it is narrow enough in terms of what the Congress was attempting to accomplish through family planning services, that is to permit indigent women to limit and/or space their children, that the very alternatives available to the doctor to meet that purpose, for the woman, the alternatives are so narrow, that Congress must have meant for the States to include all those alternatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="2775.462" offset="11202686">Then in my example about anesthesia where the patient wants a more expensive anesthesia than the doctor could in good conscience say it was necessary, is she entitled to it?</text>

            <text syncTime="2793.806" offset="11276038">I assume that the doctor is making that determination because of alternative anesthetics available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.682" offset="11303518">What we are saying is when the doctor and the woman are faced with condition of pregnancy; they have two alternatives, childbirth services or abortion services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.089" offset="11341135">And in that context, neither service can be considered more or less necessary than the other service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.341" offset="11374154">So it is distinguishable from a situation where a doctor, for very obvious reasons, might say something that is not medically necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.135" offset="11413337">And we do admit that the State can consider notions of medical necessity again such as the example we used in our brief which was the physical examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.521" offset="11450849">They could say physical examinations; the State will determine are not medically necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.534" offset="11470911">Now, some doctors may disagree with that, but to the extent that they say that and use that to exclude that service, they are also saying that the money that we are going to save by not providing those services can be addressed to more urgent needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.198" offset="11525559">But when the state says medical necessity, in terms of the issue before the Court today, there is no moneysaving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.874" offset="11548338">There is no one else to be serving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.792" offset="11555966">There is no interest to be furthered when they say medical necessity at the time of utilization of the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.130" offset="11605285">Turning quickly to the family planning services argument, again, trying to be brief, focusing in on the H.E.W regulations, respondents submit that the regulation contained in the 45-CFR-249-10-A-5 namely that H.E.W. requires that the services provided must be sufficient in amount, scope and duration to reasonable achieve their purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.348" offset="11722209">And, what we are saying here as I indicated before, the specific Congressional purpose of the family planning services was to permit the indigent woman to limit or space her children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.207" offset="11765677">That goal is so narrow that if you eliminate what has been professionally accepted as a part of a comprehensive system of family planning services, namely contraceptive, abortion, sterilization and treatment for infertility, that the State?s discretion becomes much more narrow and in fact, they cannot restrict the services of any of those four major components of a comprehensive system of family planning services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.050" offset="11885004">Secondly, as to the categorically needy individuals, we focus on the H.E.W. requirement that the State cannot arbitrarily deny or reduce the amount, scope or duration of the service because of the type of illness or condition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.890" offset="11944354">What we submit for the categorically needy women that to the extent that a woman?s previous family planning services did not work, that is a method of contraception failed and she is now pregnant, she is totally being excluded by the State?s restrictive policy and secondly, for those women who never sought family planning services until they became pregnant, she too.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.433" offset="12034529">We have two classes of individuals who are totally being excluded by the State?s policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.555" offset="12067025">Returning quickly to the medical necessity issue, our position here is that, again, medical necessity in a vacuum that is where the State cannot show some other interest that is going to be furthered is not permitted under the Act because the Act requires a rational connection between the exclusion and the furthering of some legitimate state purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.380" offset="14154314">Three points, Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.143" offset="14169360">First, the reason that my brother opponent is hearing a lot of this for the first time is of course he has raised a lot of it for the first time at this late date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.240" offset="14213768">I might point out in answer to Mr. Justice Rehnquist?s question we do have a lot of controversy because the plaintiffs themselves admitted and I am quoting from page 1 and 2 of my reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.583" offset="14259117">?In a stipulation filed with the Court, continuance of the pregnancy did not threaten the health or life of the mother,? referring to some of the plaintiffs of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.464" offset="14294643">So there is no question, but that the plaintiffs in this case were seeking an elective, non-medically necessary abortion, however that term is defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3557.475" offset="14330692">Obviously, these stipulations were of plaintiff?s counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.490" offset="14346784">There can be no question at this point that we have a live controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.868" offset="14368309">Secondly, counsel asserts that family planning services requirement of Title XIX is broad enough to cover abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.499" offset="14402790">It may well be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.669" offset="14407492">The question is not whether it is broad enough to cover abortions, the question is does it mandate abortions?</text>
            <text syncTime="3582.815" offset="14432047">In fact, I would inform the Court that H.E.W. which by the way has taken a position supporting the Commonwealth through the Solicitor General, in this case, H.E.W. will not reimburse abortions as a family planning device logically because the reimbursement rate is quite high.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.335" offset="14502160">It is 90% for that family planning device and it is substantially lower in the other portion of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.193" offset="14541553">Respondents are arguing that pregnancy requires medical services and I quote my opponent, ?And the only question is whether or not the pregnancy is going to be terminated.?</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.703" offset="14591603">That is not the only question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.884" offset="14596305">The question is whether or not the services are sought by the physician or sought by the patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.183" offset="14617517">Whether or not they are elective or whether or not they are medically required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.778" offset="14631936">If they are the latter, we pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.648" offset="14643430">If they are the former, we do not and this is consistent throughout the entire program with the exception of family planning which is by definition a preventive medical care program.</text>
