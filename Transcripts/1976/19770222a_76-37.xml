            <label>Ms. Sharon K. Wallis</label>
            <text syncTime="65.578" offset="362817">Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.904" offset="376088">The question presented by this case is whether one particular public school, the Central High School Philadelphia, may exclude academically qualified female students solely on the basis of their gender.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.274" offset="449544">District Court below applied this court’s analysis unread and examined all the proper justifications for this policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.079" offset="500848">After identifying the school district’s goals and examining its justification in terms of the particular facts of this case, determined that the policy had not been shown to be fairly and substantially related to any of the respondent’s legitimate objectives.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.043" offset="600636">This case presents the clearest and most compelling case in which segregation and public education violates the equal protection clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.090" offset="648806">Central High School is unique institution for many reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.389" offset="674092">It was the first high school in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.828" offset="687781">It happens also to be the second public high school.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.396" offset="714112">His one of two schools, both of them being single sex schools which are characterized as Academic High schools in the public school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.368" offset="770014">Academic High schools are defined in terms of their exclusively academic curriculum and also their high admission standards which are only met by 7% of the students in the Philadelphia school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.166" offset="833126">Because of these unique characteristics of Central High that it’s particularly difficult to justify the exclusion of female students in that institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.614" offset="890909">It’s an exclusion that dates back originally to a time when Central was the only school in public school in Philadelphia.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.063" offset="936780">Public high school education was only offered to exceptionally gifted students and it was not offered to female students because it was not regarded as appropriate to their abilities and their needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.438" offset="994249">That’s what this court has referred to as old notions about the role of women and men in society.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.862" offset="1027895">Subsequently, Philadelphia High School for Girls was developed as an all female school which has the same admission standards but it does not have the history or the character of Central High School.</text>

            <text syncTime="267.156" offset="1169165">Well, Central has a very unique history not only because it was the first high school in Philadelphia but because it always held a certain position in the school system as the training ground for leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.666" offset="1243144">If you are interested, you might want to look at (Inaudible) Republic which goes in some great detail of the history of Central High School.</text>

            <label>Ms. Sharon K. Wallis</label>
            <text syncTime="299.181" offset="1297270">Its reputation, its standing in the community and I think above all, its mission that is that it was always held to be and it was created to be a special school for training leaders within the public school system.</text>

            <label>Ms. Sharon K. Wallis</label>
            <text syncTime="320.537" offset="1382638">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.405" offset="1386086">Well, the stated objective, which is repeated again and again, as you have seen in the Cornad Book, some excerpts of that are quoted not only in our brief but also in the brief of the United States as amicus curiae.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.120" offset="1448989">The goal of the school, the concept of the school was “to train leaders in industry and unlike” to train leaders in all fields of endeavor.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.881" offset="1492039">That was an education that was only open to male students.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.638" offset="1511056">The definition of the school was one of preparing people for leadership and I think we are relying obviously on Sweatt v. Painter.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.012" offset="1564555">I am taking that a step further in a sense, what I am saying is the school not only has all of the characteristics that made for greatness in an educational institution that is outstanding alumni, a great tradition of accomplishment as well as particular high reputation national reputation.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.082" offset="1656819">But in addition to that this is the result of a conscious effort to maintain such an institution within the Philadelphia school system and that institution has traditionally been exclusively open to male students.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.713" offset="1739366">The trial court here did find that the education available at Philadelphia High School for Girls was substantially equivalent to that available Central, but if you look at that finding authority and the surrounding findings, it become very clear that the trial court defined education as level of classroom instruction and the trial court mentions, for example, Central is the only high school in Philadelphia with the substantial private endowment that’s the Barnwell Foundation.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.922" offset="1892235">The Barnwell Foundation was responsible for bringing to the schools such distinguished speakers and this is just recently as Robert Kennedy when he was Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.029" offset="1940613">Hubert Humphrey when he was Vice President.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.097" offset="1952839">More recently it does not happen to be mentioned in the courts opinion, Elliott Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.313" offset="1977707">This is not something in the very text.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.202" offset="2249276">Suppose as with some of the schools, they decided that four hours a day was enough class time for the students and in the same building under the same name with the same faculty, you had the boys go to school from eight until twelve and the girls go to school from one until five.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.302" offset="2341750">Then I would think you would agree that -- perhaps you would not that this is identical which to say what could be the problem in your view.</text>

            <text syncTime="1272.622" offset="5190977">In Sweatt v. Painter, the court hypothesized that the Jim Crow Law School and the University of Texas would be equal in that particular way and found that all of these other characteristic what they called intangibles were terribly important in determining whether equal protection standard was met.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.723" offset="5275405">We have all those findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.174" offset="5281152">I am not asking you to overrule the findings of the District Court; I am just asking you to apply Sweatt to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.563" offset="5314798">If you look at Footnote 1, the District Court confused Brown and Sweatt and said in order to apply Sweatt, you had to show feeling and inferiority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.311" offset="5345727">That is just wrong under law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.042" offset="5352623">That is why the District Court did not make use of the findings, but the findings are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.763" offset="5379581">We are not asking you to make any new findings that are not in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.596" offset="5402883">Now, that and in addition to that the court and both, Sweatt and McLaughlin was concerned, I believe, with individuals who were destined for leadership positions in the community and according to both of those cases says that the free exchange of ideas with members of the dominant society is a very important interest in addition to the intangibles like prestige of the faculty and prestige of graduates, etcetera, etcetera that just the opportunity to the free exchange of ideas is essentially important to those individuals who are going to take on leadership positions in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.042" offset="5572679">To that extent, I am arguing that segregated education is hardest to sustain when you are talking about the most talented young women in the public school community because the net context you are talking about girls who are going to be lawyers and doctors and judges and all of those things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.148" offset="5669123">And it is most important for them just as it is important for them to graduate from a school where that they will have an entree to alumni who are in leadership positions in those fields of endeavor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.305" offset="5713740">It is important for them to go to school with the boys who are likewise going to be leaders in all of those fields of endeavor perhaps in greater numbers for sometime to come.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.344" offset="5761910">Cutting of those contexts does a great disservice to these particular women.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.494" offset="5798481">Now, with the court’s permission I would like to reserve rest of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1443.557" offset="5874759">This is not a case of an invidious sex based discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.410" offset="5898164">I would point out to the court the finding, which was made by the District Court, Finding No. 18 on page 43(a) of the petition that Girls High School, the school which is available to the petitioners “has to build the vision of many 19th Century as educators both men and women by becoming the equals of Central in preparing its students for college.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.335" offset="6009864">Talking about a high school here, Your Honors, especially in all academic senior high school function of which is to prepare students for college.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.268" offset="6049570">Girls High School and Central High School are equal in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.134" offset="6073080">The District Court apparently thought that there was a constitutional right to a coeducational academic education right which I do not think this court has ever found and said that it did not have to take into account the existence of Girls High School.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.759" offset="6151552">Petitioner’s desire to attend Central High School was sufficient basis for its decision that we did find then on to the rational relationship standard the school district’s policy passed constitutional muster in the way in the words of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.019" offset="6232532">Your Honor, essentially Girls High School is just as good as Central High School.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.084" offset="6276835">The only finding in the record and it was not a finding that was the basis for the District Court’s decision concerns the science facilities, Your Honors, and that finding apparently is based on statement by a student who was witnessed for the petitioners that Central has a student-built cyclotron and a classroom planetarium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.796" offset="6371712">There is nothing else in the record concerning the science facilities and in the record is the very expensive science program available for females at Girls High School.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.013" offset="6424584">The course list, which is in the record in Exhibit D2, is quite expensive, really more expensive than that available at Central High School.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.843" offset="6463872">But essentially we are dealing with two institutions which are equal in preparing the students for college.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.872" offset="6495950">At one point the District Judge said, they were comparable and either statement of the comparison between the two schools were satisfied that they are substantially equal.</text>
