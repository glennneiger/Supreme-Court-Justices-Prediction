            <text syncTime="6.050" offset="24137">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.522" offset="38034">This case involves questions regarding the constitutionality of two Virginia statutes under which the State of Virginia licenses corporations for the taking of fish in its territorial waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.664" offset="94563">The statutes are set out in the appendix beginning at page 114.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.446" offset="113685">The first of these statutes is Virginia Code Section 28.1-60.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.548" offset="142106">I refer to that Section 60 or the residency law.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.328" offset="161228">By this statute, Virginia regulates one of its fisheries, the Chesapeake Bay and Menhaden fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.923" offset="191634">So this statute is limited to one fishery and one body of water in inland sea, Chesapeake Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.839" offset="223295">By virtue of this statute, foreign -- excuse me -- non-resident corporations are ineligible for licenses for the taking of Menhaden in the Chesapeake Bay fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.618" offset="270420">They are eligible for the taking of Menhaden in the Atlantic Coastal waters of Virginia within the three-mile territorial sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.249" offset="308976">The appellees in this case Seacoast Products, Incorporated and its two subsidiaries, the new Smith Mill Company and second, the Oceanic Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.599" offset="342309">Our corporation is located and having their principal places of business in New Jersey and New York and are not under the Virginia statute resident corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.889" offset="383478">They are therefore do not have licenses for the Chesapeake Bay and Menhaden fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.996" offset="407928">The second of these two statutes is found at page 117 in the appendix, this is titled 28.1 of Code of Virginia Section 81.1.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.254" offset="456934">For ease of discussion, I'd like to refer to that as Section 81.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.640" offset="478459">By the statute, Virginia provides that all of its fisheries that foreign-controlled corporations shall be ineligible for licenses for any of Virginia's fisheries.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.999" offset="535928">The test of foreign control considers various factors including the president and chief executive officer or other chief executive officer and the Board of Directors chairman, also the percentage of stockholding by United States citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.053" offset="604160">In essence, it requires that the control in the corporation through stockholders be in the hands of United States citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.331" offset="645224">The lower court upon request of the appellees held that these statutes violated certain constitutional provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.911" offset="679602">The -- the lower court held first of all that the -- the bay Menhaden residency law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and thereby inform -- restrained further enforcement of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.339" offset="745326">The lower court held that Section 81 which bars foreign-controlled corporations from taking fish in Virginia was preempted by force of a Federal Act, the Bartlett Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.430" offset="797675">This statute is set out on page 118 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.921" offset="823589">I first turned to the question of preemption and we would submit of course that the lower courts holding to the effect that Section 81 by foreign-controlled corporations in Virginia's fisheries is not preempted either by the Bartlett Act or any other federal enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.700" offset="918779">The lower court held of course that the Bartlett Act, 16 U.S.C., Section 108 preempted Virginia's right to deny licenses to foreign-controlled corporations within these territorial waters under Section 81.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.968" offset="971860">But the Bartlett Act, it's clear, it applies only to United States vessels -- excuse me -- applies only to foreign flag vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.270" offset="1009058">This -- this Act bars foreign flag vessels from fishing within 12 miles of United States' coast under current law.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.027" offset="1040091">Under the new provisions of the extended U.S. fishery zone, foreign flag vessels will be barred from fishing within 200 miles of the United States' coast.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.233" offset="1084918">In any event the federal Act clearly applies only to foreign flag vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.430" offset="1105711">The Virginia Act here clearly applies to United States flag, domestic fishing vessels, albeit operated by foreign controlled corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.488" offset="1145940">The waters affected are Virginia's waters and therefore the two statutes cannot possibly, as a practical matter, conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.229" offset="1180839">The United States in this brief has agreed with our position on that and we take special note of that because the United States, of course, is responsible for enforcement of the Bartlett Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.572" offset="1218247">They find no preemptive effect or intent in the federal Bartlett Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="931.163" offset="3724643">An alternative theory of preemption has been offered that the fact that Seacoast vessels which they purchased from an American controlled corp -- controlled corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.648" offset="3774589">The fact that this transfer or sail was approved by the United States under a procedure of the Shipping Act Sections 9 and 37, that this in fact preempts the right of Virginia under Section 81 to bar Seacoast as a foreign controlled corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.874" offset="3843448">It's clear from several sources that these acts, the -- the Shipping Act Sections 9 and 37 have -- as their sole purpose control of the sail of vessels to foreign interest for the purpose of national defense and security, counsel for the Maritime Administration in recent hearings looking into foreign investment in American fisheries has confirmed this.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.072" offset="3952222">We have referred to it in our reply brief at page 11, footnote 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.678" offset="3970612">In that case -- in that instance, he indicated that the sole purpose of these statutes is national defense, certainly not to preempt the right of the states license for taking a fish within their borders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.161" offset="4024633">We would submit therefore that no federal enactment cited by Seacoast or the United States in any way preempts or even purports to preempt the right of the states to license fisheries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.600" offset="4066325">That be the case, the remaining question is whether or not the two statutes under consideration here, license fishing in Virginia's waters under constitution inconsistent with constitutional principles, and we submit that both statutes do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.948" offset="4135706">The first statute, Section 81, is clearly a conservation of fisheries statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.497" offset="4169979">The depletion of the United States fisheries stocks by foreign fishing interest is well documented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.319" offset="4193176">The findings of Congress in passage of the new federal act, public law 94265 known as the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the -- the findings of Congress in that case document the fact that foreign fishing interest, because of their self-interest in economic gain have depleted our fisheries in nearly every instance where they have been allowed to fish either outside the 12-mile limit or inside the 12-mile limit under permits and international agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.678" offset="4330684">In those cases, they have violated agreements made enforcement impractical and in fact, this is the factor which has led the way in extending the United States fishery zone out to 200 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.690" offset="4390661">The Virginia law is premised upon the same findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.035" offset="4404140">Virginia has suffered at the hands of foreign fishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.057" offset="4416157">The entire river herring industry in Virginia was destroyed virtually in a period of two to three years of foreign fishing, scooping up the fish as they exited Virginia's waters to spawn and depleting entirely the stocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.046" offset="4484180">The Virginia law saw the advent of the new 200-mile law and recognized that there would be a great attempt by foreign fishing interest to avoid the new 200-mile federal law by operating United States flag vessels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.101" offset="4556382">The federal law simply provides that foreign flag vessels may not enter beyond the line of 200 miles, but it does not in any way protect the states from foreign fishing interest who would set up shell corporations in any of the states including Virginia and thereby be eligible under federal law to license their vessels as domestic United States flag vessels, the same situation that pertains with Seacoast and fish with impunity in Virginia waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.879" offset="4687412">The evil has been established here that the foreign fishing practices do deplete fisheries, and in fact, Virginia laws merely supplements federal law in seeking to protect its waters from possible dangers and in fact very probable dangers of an influx of foreign investment in U.S. vessels setting up shell corporations to meet any residency requirements of the states and the complete and other destruction of our fisheries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.795" offset="4811128">Seacoast has attempted to show this law as directed at them alone but in fact this law applies to all of Virginia's fishing industry, all fisheries and foreign-controlled corporations are barred from all fishing in Virginia not simply the Menhaden Industry in which Seacoast has in fact been engaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.232" offset="4900885">And furthermore, Seacoast has presented no real competitive factor in the past as we've outlined in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.690" offset="4930664">Thirty six -- pages 36 and 37 of the appendix indicate that Seacoast has done little or no fishing in recent years in Virginia so that it is very difficult to attach the motive of elimination of competition to the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.064" offset="4996180">It's clearly premised upon the same findings and conservation purposes as the federal act and we submit that in that light, it clearly meets the constitutional standards of the Fourteenth Amendment consistent with the holdings of McGowan versus Maryland and a series of other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.307" offset="5077159">Turning now to the Virginia residency law, I would note first that if -- if the application of Virginia's foreign controlled corporation law barring the taking of fish in Virginia waters by foreign-controlled corporations Section 81.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.439" offset="5137659">If that statute is upheld in this case as applied to Seacoast, there is no need to reach the question of the validity of the second statute about which I'm ready to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.781" offset="5187082">Section 60 would bar the nonresident corporations in Virginia's Chesapeake Bay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.834" offset="5223236">Its prescription is much more limited in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.769" offset="5242984">This statute applies to an industry which may be helpful if we discuss something about the Menhaden industry to put this statute in perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.735" offset="5282900">Menhaden entered the coastal waters of the United States in the early spring and began migrating up the Atlantic coast spawning in their migration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.709" offset="5326785">The newly spawned fingerlings entered coastal waters primarily the Chesapeake Bay and other large embayments with estuaries which lead off as protective nurseries for these fish.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.556" offset="5378194">Virginia's residency requirement under Section 60 does not apply to the three-mile Atlantic Coastal Menhaden Fishery, and therefore there's no impediment to the migration of Menhaden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.964" offset="5439843">Furthermore, the Virgina season on the taking of Menhaden in the Chesapeake Bay does not in any way interfere with the migration of mature Menhaden out of the bay during the winter months, the early -- early winter months and the late fall.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.117" offset="5540467">The young fish are those that populate the bay and is a rather fragile resource because they are two-year old and less fish, the Manumbar or Mataura fish migrate up and down the coastal waters in the more northern section before returning and migrating south for the winter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.645" offset="5618521">With that in mind, the Virginia statute is limited to the Chesapeake Bay and inland body of water and it simply provides that residents only in terms of corporate residency may take these fish.</text>

            <text syncTime="2032.236" offset="8128888">I would like to outline briefly the nature of the fishery that we're talking about, discuss the enrollment and licensing provisions which are critical here, the effect on -- I consider our foreign policy and then deal in some detail in the two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2054.980" offset="8219899">We're here talking about competing companies engaged in the Menhaden fishery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.774" offset="8243096">They're basically three companies that are somewhat similar in its basic setup to the automobile industry in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.753" offset="8274965">By that analogy which is fairly close, our principal competitor, Zapata Haynie, is the General Motors of the Menhaden trade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.259" offset="8309029">Our client would come in at the Ford level and standard products would come in at the Chrysler level.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.734" offset="8330867">But for all practical purposes, the Menhaden fishery really is run by these three large corporations and we compete against each other all up and down the East Coast and in the Gulf Coast states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.455" offset="8385724">With -- with that background, I think you can better understand the motivation that really was operative in the Virginia legislature when the two Virginia-based corporations that is Zapata Haynie and standard products saw that there was an opportunity because of a change in ownership of my client's company to get the Virginia legislature to put through a restrictive statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.093" offset="8492304">Zapata Haynie in particular sponsored that statute sent its lawyer and to testify about it, talked about the threatened -- the Russian invasion of the Chesapeake Bay and in that context under emergency conditions, the statute is saying, “You must be a citizen corporation or owned by citizens” was put through.</text>

            <text syncTime="2227.062" offset="8908173">We had to set up a Virginia resident corporation which we did and we had a plan in Virginia at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.090" offset="8932310">But at all of the time that I am talking about which goes back for many, many years, the vessels of Seacoast wondered as the Menhaden do from state to state in the offshore waters but within the three-mile limit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.987" offset="8991869">It is in the nature of Menhaden to come into these inshore waters in the spring and summer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.027" offset="9016007">They generally come into the more southern states first and gradually migrate toward the north up toward Cape Cod.</text>
            <text syncTime="2261.575" offset="9046204">It is their characteristic and this makes some -- makes the fishery commercially viable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.364" offset="9065430">It is their characteristic to school up in massive schools only in this summer migratory pass and only in inshore waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.906" offset="9107540">Practically all of the Menhaden that is captured for commercial purposes is taken in closed shore.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.841" offset="9131363">Now, that takes care of the outlying shore -- shore areas but they are important interior base and river estuaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.835" offset="9171278">Now for example, we've mentioned the Chesapeake but the Delaware River is important so as Long Island sounds, so as Narragansett Bay and the waters around Cape Cod.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.531" offset="9206073">These are all waters where the Menhaden move on their travels.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.014" offset="9224046">It is their nature to spawn in the open ocean, drift in towards shore when there are very tiny, almost little particles and then grow in the estuarine waters of Virginia, North Carolina, Delaware, the other shore states.</text>

            <text syncTime="3520.397" offset="14081567">I'd like to quote briefly from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.493" offset="14089927">That was the case where New York, my state, adapted a taxing program that tended to favor the New York exchanges as against the regional exchanges, and this Court struck down that statute and -- and said this, “As we stated at the offset, the fundamental purpose of the clause is to sure -- to assure that there would be free trade among the several states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.886" offset="14171533">This free trade purpose is not confined to the freedom to trade with only one state; it is a freedom to trade with any state to engage in commerce across all state boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.372" offset="14209463">There has been no prior occasion expressly to address the question whether a state may tax in a manner that discriminates between two types of interstate transactions in order to pay their local commercial interests over out-of-state business, but the clear import of our commerce clause cases is at such discrimination is constitutionally impermissible.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3765.582" offset="15062309">That fact is belied by the fact that this statue applies to every single fishery and fishing industry in Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3775.160" offset="15100552">It does not confine itself to the Menhaden fishery.</text>
