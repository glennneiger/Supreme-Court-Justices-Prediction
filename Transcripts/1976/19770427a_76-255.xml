            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100548">We will hear arguments next in 76-255, Hazelwood School District against the United States.</text>

            <label>Mr. William H. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="54.861" offset="319977">Mr. Chief Justice, May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.733" offset="335441">This case concerns charges by the government that the Hazelwood School District in suburban of St. Louis discriminated against black applicants for teaching positions in violation of the civil rights of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.064" offset="420705">After a trial, the district court found the charges not substantiated and granted judgment for the school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.248" offset="453515">The Court of Appeals reversed and directed the order entry of a remedial order.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.312" offset="477756">In this Court two questions are raised on review of the Court of Appeals’ judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.309" offset="497714">One is whether the Court of Appeals could legally find in violation of Title VII on the basis of a comparison of the proportion of Black members of Hazelwood’s faculty, with the proportion of Blacks among teachers in the whole St. Louis area when evidence was available in the record, as we contend to show that Hazelwood did not discriminate against actual Black applicants for jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.165" offset="625191">The other question is whether given the findings and the evidence on which those findings rest, the Court of Appeals in this case which we submit lack the element of purpose, there is any constitutional basis or the application of Title VII to this public school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.021" offset="728532">Since, it was formed about a quarter of a century ago, the Hazelwood school district has grown….</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="163.760" offset="755490">But if we disagreed with you on purpose, that your question is answered.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_allen" startTime="170.296" stopTime="624.177">
            <label>Mr. William H. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="170.296" offset="781717">We have no constitutional claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.855" offset="795928">There is no doubt Your Honor that under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment without regard to the commerce clause, Congress can enforce the equal protection clause, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.856" offset="843888">The Hazelwood district in 25 years has grown from a small rural collection of grammar schools to rather good sized suburban school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.045" offset="904701">The area it serves is a populous outlying suburb of St. Louis, a predominantly white suburb.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.468" offset="934377">There were no black residents in the District of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.588" offset="950886">Consequently Hazelwood never maintained the system of separate schools that was required by Missouri law up until the time of the Brown against Board of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.046" offset="1012639">There were 59 black students in the school year 1967-68 and nearly 600 out of 25000 total enrollments in the school year 1973-74.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.333" offset="1077841">Hazelwood hired its first Black teacher in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.062" offset="1100724">By the school year 1973-74, 22 of a faculty of a faculty of about 1200 were blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.535" offset="1134684">The official policy of the district, since sometime before 1964, has been to hire the most competent, the best qualified teachers without regard to race, color or other extraneous factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.109" offset="1200930">In the 1960s, Hazelwood had to engage in rather extensive recruiting in order to find the most qualified, most competent teachers it wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.442" offset="1246279">At that time the demand for teachers was greater than the supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.243" offset="1281492">Today recruiting is not nearly so necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.467" offset="1306360">Hazelwood indeed is deluged with applications for teaching positions, ten or a dozen for every vacancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.008" offset="1344499">These applications are received in a central office, Hazelwood’s personnel office.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.837" offset="1371875">There, in that central office, vacancies are made known by the school principals and the central office is asked to refer applicants for interviews and they are referred for interviews without any real evaluation of their qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.039" offset="1464662">At the individual schools, when the interviews are conducted, they are conducted by principals and in some cases in the secondary schools by department heads.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.723" offset="1499353">They seek through the interviewing process to find the best qualified or most competent teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.165" offset="1541149">Title VII was made applicable to Hazelwood and other public bodies in March of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.429" offset="1570197">Few months later, in October, the Justice department gave Hazelwood notice that it was considering filing a Title VII case against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.529" offset="1610635">The suit was actually filed in August 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.796" offset="1627666">It alleged a pattern or practice of discrimination against Black applicants for teaching positions in violation of Title VII and in addition alleged a violation of Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.033" offset="1688584">The government searched through Hazelwood’s files of applications, employment forms and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.168" offset="1729126">It took depositions of Hazelwood’s top school administrators, principals, superintendents, personnel officers and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.352" offset="1757861">Exhibits that were consisted of copies of the file material were constructed from that file material were a principal part of the government’s case at trial, the depositions came in at trial and in addition, 25 black applicants for teaching positions testified as to the circumstances of their applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.764" offset="1855559">The government set out to prove that Hazelwood had deliberately, purposefully engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against Black job applicants generally, a showing of a few isolated cases of unfavorable treatment of the individuals, Black applicants for teaching positions would not do to make the kind of case that the government set out to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.284" offset="1985648">The government tried to show that Hazelwood’s hiring procedures, its decentralized system of interviewing that I described, disfavored Black applicants generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.529" offset="2030579">The fact was the Hazelwood’s files showed the contrary that between 1971 and 1973, 17 Black applicants were hired or offered jobs and 52 were identified by the government as having been rejected for teaching jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.638" offset="2119082">It's on the face of it; that is a much greater proportion of hires than they were for applicants generally in that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.977" offset="2148444">So the government adopted as the centerpiece of it's attempted showing of a pattern or practice of discrimination, a comparison of the racial composition of the Hazelwood’s faculty in 1973-74, approximately 2% black with the racial composition of the St. Louis City and county teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.403" offset="2270070">In other words, as shown by the census of the 1970, 15% of all the teachers in St. Louis City and county were black.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.098" offset="2308940">In addition, the government noted that an ad, a newspaper advertisement for features that appeared Jackson, Mississippi over Hazelwood’s name back in 1962, with the words white only in it, the same ad had run else where without that notation at the same time, that Hazelwood had used application forms up until 1962-63, some of which carried lines for racial identification, that Hazelwood had not recruited a pre-dominantly black colleges in the 1960s when recruitment was a part of it's hiring process.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.492" offset="2490439">In addition, the government also cited the cases of the 52 unsuccessful Black applicants that it had identified and said that they had been rejected in the favor of whites, no better qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.611" offset="2558984">Hazelwood argued that none of this showed discrimination, District Court agreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.644" offset="2583121">On appeal, the Court of Appeals found…</text>

            <text syncTime="629.267" offset="2617603">On appeal, the Court of Appeals found that the discrepancy between the racial composition of the Hazelwood’s faculty and this St. Louis city and county labor market taken in light of what it termed unstructured standard-less hiring procedures with vague and subjective criteria made a prima facie case of discrimination in violation of Title VII.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="657.645" offset="2731079">Mr. Allen, you understand the Court of Appeals holding to have rested solely on Title VII and not on any violation of the Fourteenth Amendment?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_allen" startTime="666.964" stopTime="839.133">
            <label>Mr. William H. Allen</label>
            <text syncTime="666.964" offset="2768381">Court of Appeals recited that there was the charge of a violation of a Fourteenth Amendment at the outset of this opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.405" offset="2798161">It found that no such violation in the course of its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.272" offset="2817596">I think it is fair Mr. Rehnquist to say that the Court of Appeals did not find a violation in the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.301" offset="2853750">It found that this prima facie case that it based principally on the statistics of a violation of Title VII was buttressed by these incidents from Hazelwood’s history that I recited and its analysis of the government showing of rejected Black applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.745" offset="2923444">On that analysis, it found that 16 out of 52 of the black applicants had been rejected for jobs for which whites no better qualified had later been hired and of those 16, only 2 had gone through the interview process which was a only part of whole hiring procedure of which the court was critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.473" offset="3042354">It did not in our view, this has become a matter of contention, but in our view it clearly, the court did not find purposeful discrimination and as I have said in response to Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question, it did not find a violation of a Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.340" offset="3117900">We submit that the Court of Appeals erred in placing its reliance on the workforce labor market comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.898" offset="3160114">My argument on that score is a simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.059" offset="3176728">I think, despite the impression that might be gotten from the rather extensive discussion of the record that appears in the briefs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.152" offset="3217061">Let me try to make it simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.105" offset="3228868">That sort of comparison of racial composition of an employer’s workforce and of the racial composition of a labor market is in some circumstances a valid test for, whether there has been a violation of Title VII, but the circumstances simply did not obtain here.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.464" offset="3358331">For one thing, the circumstances didn’t obtain because of the problem induced or the labor market statistics by the hiring practices of the City of St. Louis schools; that City of St. Louis schools deliberately tried and succeeded in maintaining an approximate 50/50 ratio balance between blacks and whites.</text>

            <text syncTime="845.760" offset="3483510">The City of St. Louis as I understand that runs north along the ballast of Mississippi river and there is a small point there where the Hazelwood district which generally lies north of the City of St. Louis abuts it, but in no realistic sense is that a channel of trade or communication between the two.</text>

            <text syncTime="887.193" offset="3649230">I think our statistical analysis is based on the preposition that there are not 15% of teachers in the workforce, who are black in St. Louis city and county, who are available for hire by Hazelwood.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.985" offset="3724463">The government’s position as I understand is that the workforce comparison is legitimate because absent discrimination, it means that would be the composition of the employer’s workforce and that situation is simply not true here where one has this distorting effect, that is our position in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.381" offset="3801995">But there is really a deeper and more basic flaw in the use of the workforce labor market comparison in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.549" offset="3858732">At its best, even if constructed validly, that comparison is a get only.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.633" offset="3891020">For a true comparison of how an employer has treated black applicants, actual black applicants for job on the one hand and how it has treated applicants generally on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.061" offset="3948698">Now, the government does not deny that.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.704" offset="3955281">I don’t think, they don’t acknowledge it, but they don’t deny it.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.215" offset="3969387">It seems an obvious enough point.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.740" offset="3975448">They say that this latter evidence was not available in the record, but there was that evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.423" offset="4006168">Evidence as to the number of applications generally and number of hires generally, the number of black applicants and the number of black applicants hired and that evidence as I have indicated showed that blacks faired at least as well as whites in the periods 1971-72, 1972-73, and 1973-74.</text>

            <text syncTime="1842.069" offset="7468750">We find ourselves in a peculiar position here of not believing that either of the questions presented in the petition for certiorari which this court granted is really presented by this case, unless it can be said that the second question is presented in a very limited sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.213" offset="7557358">We went into the District Court in this case and introduced evidence to establish a four-pronged showing of a prima facie case that employment discrimination by the Hazelwood school district and that four-pronged showing as we presented our case, is very well summarized by Mr. Justice Clark’s opinion for the Court of Appeals set forth in the appendix of the petition for writ of certiorari.</text>

            <text syncTime="1928.597" offset="7814925">Now, it my understanding that the Act is applied to private individuals was first enacted in the 1964, and that it was made applicable to the governmental subdivisions only in 1972.</text>

            <text syncTime="1958.239" offset="7933417">The fact of the matter is the school district was under an obligation under the Fourteenth Amendment not to discriminate in its hiring practices during that entire period of time and the evidence show that pattern or practice of discrimination during that period, the portion of which from March 24th 1972 was covered by the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2909.876" offset="11739980">The school district had presented one witness and several exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2916.254" offset="11765475">The witness testified to the total number of teachers who applied and were hired during the 1971-72 and 1973-74 school years and you can see the figures there at the bottom of page 7B which indicated hiring in access of 200 teachers per year during the statutory period and the exhibits consisted of the policy manual, policy books, staff handbook and historical summary of the formation of the Hazelwood School District and then at the top of page 8B, Hazelwood argued that no discrimination could be proved because equal employment opportunity was it's official policy and because of the small numbers of black teachers was comparable to the small number of black students enrolled in Hazelwood schools and beyond that the only defense offered was an attempt by Hazelwood to contend that it was following a policy of hiring the best qualified and vast majority of the best qualified applicants were white and for that reason there was a very small number of blacks, 10 up to the time that Hazelwood was notified that our investigation was underway with that information as a footnote 10 on page 7 of our record, for that reason there was a very small number of blacks hired and because that was the defense, our evidence focused on showing who was hired in place of the unsuccessful black applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.371" offset="12178001">We introduced extensive evidence with respect to which of these people hired had poor academic records, been on academic probation and that sort of thing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3063.105" offset="12352917">In fact, the United States expressly at the beginning of its case on trial and this is setout in full as explanation of our introduction of any of this material on page 11 of the brief filed in our support by the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and there we said that the outset of the case in view of the district’s action severely restricting the pool of available qualified black applicants and its practice of destroying applications filed after one year, it is not been possible to obtain facts on all or probably most black applicants to the district and we have collected in our brief in footnote 93 on page 26th, the number of the examples of black applicants whose application could not be found by the district, even though they were during the period when supposedly the applications had not yet been destroyed…</text>

            <text syncTime="3167.626" offset="12770981">Now, the record is actually very sketchy on how we identify these 50 or 60 because no defense was ever made that black applicants were being treated better than white applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.550" offset="12822703">The whole defense was the other way around that the whites hired were better qualified than the blacks and that is why so few blacks were being hired.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="3363.486" offset="13554445">We showed that in these statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.314" offset="13561759">They show when 284 were being hired altogether and only seven or nine whatever it was were black that is way under the 15%.</text>

            <text syncTime="3378.574" offset="13614840">The statistics also show that the rate of hiring in itself as way under that percentage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.071" offset="13636783">So it is all part of the prima facie showing that was made here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.947" offset="13652248">The point is that the other attempt to interpolate then statistics raises evidentiary questions that were not explored below, not only about how incomplete those statistics were, but we never introduced any evidence on discriminatory reputation to show that the applicant flow to Hazelwood was being distorted because there was never any reason to have to introduce that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.961" offset="13756319">The defense was not that black applicants were being treated better than white applicants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.863" offset="13775964">That was not put an issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.979" offset="13788398">There is something very similar to what the court was referring to in Castaneda against Partida -- attempt to put forward a new array of a different statistical case that is based on untested assumptions, that were not explored below because the whole theory of the defense was different below and it seems to us this an attempt to rebut our prima facie showing comes to light, when it is based on evidentiary questions and the evidence is not there.</text>
