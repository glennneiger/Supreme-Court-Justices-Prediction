            <text syncTime="94.483" offset="478369">Mr. Chief Justice, members, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.220" offset="505327">This case is here on the writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.950" offset="536256">The question before the Court is whether three-fourths of the Rosebud Sioux Reservation in South Dakota has been terminated by three statutes adopted in 1904, 1907, and 1910.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.473" offset="606369">Each of those statutes opened a portion of the Reservation and provided for the sale of unreserved and unallotted land to settlers, had prices fixed in the statute, with the proceeds of the sales, and this is important, to be credited to the tribe in the Treasury only as received from the settlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.317" offset="725801">The Rosebud Sioux Tribe is a part of the great Sioux nation, one of the important American-Indian tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.998" offset="756521">There is an armed resident population of about 7,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.328" offset="781807">The genesis of the Reservation goes back to the 1868 Treaty when the United States and the Sioux agree to the establishment of the Great Sioux Reservation which embraces all of South Dakota, West of the Missouri River, about 25 million acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.028" offset="856622">The Treaty provided that the Reservation would be secure to them and never any part of it would be taken from them without the written consent of at least three-fourths of the male adults.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.372" offset="905941">In 1877, nine years later, the United States took 7 million acres of the Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.261" offset="933527">That left about 18 million acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.815" offset="943767">In 1889, the United States enacted the statute of that year, to which the Sioux agreed, with the three-fourths majority and half the land roughly, but 9 million acres was explicitly restored to the public domain with the provision that it would be disposed off, and the proceeds credited to the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.291" offset="1037598">This is important, at the end of ten years, any of the land left the United States would make a balloon payment and pay for all that was undisposed of.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.592" offset="1090888">As to the other 9 million acres, that was divided into six Reservations, all for the Sioux Tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.172" offset="1121190">One of those six Reservations was for the Rosebud Sioux Tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.642" offset="1139058">The 1889 Act provide for allotments, and the allotment process went forward shortly after the 1889 Act became effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.819" offset="1183780">In the back of the Greene brief, which is our opening brief, there is a map about the year of 1913, which shows the Reservation as established by the 1889 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.129" offset="1236965">It includes, starting from the Eastern end, portions of Gregory and Lyman County, then Tripp County, then Mellette County and Todd County.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.813" offset="1283776">Now, these counties of course all came after the Reservation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Marvin J. Sonosky</label>
            <text syncTime="315.398" offset="1362039">After the 1889 Act they were organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.873" offset="1387953">As I say, the allotment process went forward.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.164" offset="1417105">In 1901, the United States undertook to take a cession, an outright purchase, by the Eastern portion of the Reservation; parts of Gregory and Lyman Counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.521" offset="1474575">An agreement was negotiated in that year which provided for the outright cession, sale, conveyance, and surrender of the land, about 450,000 acres, as I recall, for a lump sum of $1,040,000.00, and the Indians consented to that, again, three-fourths majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.920" offset="1556181">The agreement provided that it would not be effective until the Indians consented and until it was ratified by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.501" offset="1582513">It went to Washington, and it was sent to Congress for ratification.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.526" offset="1602575">The House was willing to adopt the simple ratification Bill but the Senate insisted in two amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.787" offset="1623682">One of which was to grant the State all Sections, 16 and 36, the school lands, and the other one of which was to open up the lands for free homesteads.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.033" offset="1664642">There was resistance to this on the ground that, since we paid tax money for this Indian land, we ought not to be giving it away, and it failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.428" offset="1706229">Ultimately, there was a compromise and the 1904 Act was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.984" offset="1724410">The 1904 Act, which is set up in our brief, and the Appendix to the Greene brief Page 1A.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.632" offset="1771012">The 1904 Act, the format of that Act is very interesting, because the Act itself provides that the land should be opened and disposed of at the statutory price, and the proceeds credited to the tribe only as received from the settlers.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.111" offset="1848962">But the Act opens by setting out in the preamble preceding the enactment clause, the 1901 Agreement, just as it had been consented to by the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.541" offset="1894624">Then comes the enactment clause, and then follows the agreement again, except this time they leave out one article.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.997" offset="1924508">It is amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.568" offset="1930777">They amend the agreement to strip it of the article that required the Union’s consent and the ratification by Congress, and they make another amendment which was, we are not going to pay you a $1,040,000.00 for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.552" offset="1982709">What we are going to do is open up this land and dispose of it, and as it is sold, the proceeds will be credited to you only as received.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.898" offset="2016041">That was in 1904 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.930" offset="2024191">That took care of Gregory and Lyman on the Eastern end.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.412" offset="2042163">Incidentally, the best land, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.092" offset="2052821">In 1907, before the Indians had received Dollar one…</text>

            <label>Mr. Marvin J. Sonosky</label>
            <text syncTime="508.761" offset="2135577">Yes, I suppose these were credited to the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.847" offset="2151878">In 1907, before they had received any money from the sales of these lands, the 1907 Act was passed and opened up Tripp County in the same way, same type of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.423" offset="2206212">We refer to them as surplus land statutes on the theory that there were surplus to the Indian’s needs, and they were disposed off to the settlers and proceeds credited as received.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.877" offset="2255950">In 1910, it was the third statute which covered Mellette County, and that left Todd County, which was never affected by a statute, although efforts were made to obtain a similar statute for Todd County.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.234" offset="2325435">Now, each one of these three statutes, except for the 1904 Act, provided for allotments.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.274" offset="2361589">The 1904 Act, the allotments have already been made because it started out as a cession, provided for allotments to all Indians in the area to be opened, before it was opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.491" offset="2406415">Each one of them provided for a grant to the state of the school Sections 16 and 36, the United States paid for that land, $2.50 an acre.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.128" offset="2453017">The statutes also provided other benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.216" offset="2469318">But in order to make absolutely clear that the United States was not buying this land, that the Indians were not selling this land, that the United States was not paying for this land, each one of these statutes in the last section, and you can take any one of them, the first one on Page 6A, provided that nothing in the statute shall in any manner barring the United States to buy the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.533" offset="2590630">The United States was not a purchaser, and it went on to say that the United States does not guarantee to find purchasers for this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.461" offset="2618320">It went on to say it again, that the United States, all its doing here is acting as a trustee to open up this land and dispose of it and credit the tribe with the proceeds only as received.</text>

            <text syncTime="654.060" offset="2716750">Yes, Your Honor, the land was opened up and it was disposed off until 1934 when the Indian Reorganization Act was passed, at which time Congress provided that any land in this type of Reservation that were undisposed of, should be restored to the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.144" offset="2797102">And at that time this was restored to the Rosebud Tribe all undisposed of lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.138" offset="2821030">There were undisposed lands in Tripp County and Mellette County, and I just do not remember if there were any in Gregory County.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.507" offset="2854467">At the same time that was restored to the Rosebud Tribe, it was also restored to some 26 other tribes who fall in the same category.</text>

            <text syncTime="707.142" offset="2929073">I am sure the state would not argue they are outside the Reservation because they are within the exterior boundaries of the 1889 Act, and the Indian Reorganization Act limited the authority to restore only to Reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.229" offset="3009425">Now, 1910, as far as the Bureau of Indian Affairs is concerned and the Department of the Interior, this entire area is fixed by the 1889 Act, it was administered as an Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.461" offset="3070343">The tribe itself regarded all of the people who live within those boundaries as living on the reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.137" offset="3113079">In 1953, Congress passed what to Indians is the infamous Public Law 280, which authorizes state to take jurisdiction for Indians on a reservation without their consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.822" offset="3163757">The state of South Dakota in 1962 undertook to do that by an Act of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.395" offset="3190088">But the people of the State of South Dakota in a referendum repudiated that Act and set it aside by a vote, as I recall, of almost four to one.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.398" offset="3362078">Finally, this suit was instituted by the United States District Court for the District of South Dakota, and the complaint alleged, and I mention this because it defines the only issue that is before the Court, the complaint alleged that the state and counties were enforcing state laws against Indians on the open portions of the reservation, and that the state had no authority, and asked for a declaratory judgment to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.745" offset="3475450">The state answered and admitted that it was enforcing the laws only on non-trust land within the open areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.891" offset="3520067">The District Court rendered a judgment, which is very broad, and the judgment appears on the red Appendix to the petition, Page 114.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.264" offset="3597494">The District Court held that the three Acts in question did extinguish the reservation or Indian land nature of the unallotted surplus lands in the said counties by returning them to the public domain, and did diminish the geographical location of the boundaries of the Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.514" offset="3682549">On appeal the Court of Appeals, after the case was submitted in the oral argument, held the case until this Court came down on this decision in DeCoteau County State Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.838" offset="3735838">After DeCoteau came down, the Court of Appeals rendered its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.416" offset="3758095">It held that these three -- that first with the 1904 Act, that the 1904 Act ratified the 1901 agreement and that it was a cession.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.818" offset="3815773">That the 1907 Act used the identical language of cession, as did the 1904 Act, there is no language of cession in the 1907 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.418" offset="3854121">That the 1910 Act used identical words, whatever it was meant, it did not say words of cession, but identical words, and it held that the Reservation had been terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.275" offset="3921621">How did the Court of Appeals come to the conclusion that there was a cession?</text>
            <text syncTime="965.157" offset="3961118">A cession is a sale, it is a high class sale, it is a sale between sovereigns.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.082" offset="3984838">To have a sale, you have to have a seller, and you have to have a buyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.760" offset="3999571">If you have a seller and a buyer, you have an agreed price.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.271" offset="4013572">Then, you will have a sale and a cession.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.524" offset="4038545">Section 6, the last section of each one of these three surplus land acts, says in so many words that the United States is not buying this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.317" offset="4085775">We are not even guaranteeing to find buyers for this land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.349" offset="4101866">All we are doing here is agreeing to dispose of the land and credit the proceeds, and there are Reservations, if the Court please, in particular the Wind River Reservation, where the same type of statute opened the land, and only a little over 10% of the land was ever sold, and the other 90% after the Indian Reorganization Act was restored to the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.979" offset="4192354">How could the Court reach that?</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.881" offset="4204057">The Court assumed there was a cession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.086" offset="4216805">That is the fundamental error in the Court’s below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.068" offset="4232792">No where in those opinions is there any explanation of how title got out of the tribe into the United States, and how do the Court’s below square their action with the language in the last section of these statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1070.186" offset="4381272">They were the property of the tribe, they were the property of the tribe, the beneficial title to those lands never left the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.902" offset="4412096">All that happened is that those lands were subject to a statute that left them open for disposal, but until they were disposed off the tribe remained the beneficial owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.579" offset="4470820">Proof of that is that this Court held in the United States v. Creek Nation, which is cited in our briefs, where there was a mistake made by the United States surveyor in the line of the Reservation, and he puts Reservation land out into the public domain, and it was disposed off by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.544" offset="4566637">When the tribe sued to recover for just compensation, the question arose as to when did the title pass?</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.478" offset="4610418">It did not pass when the erroneous survey was made because that was a mistake of a federal officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.015" offset="4632570">The United States is not responsible for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.968" offset="4644377">But when the patent was issued to the entryman, title passed and values were determined as of the date of the issuance of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.767" offset="4687532">The same thing is true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.668" offset="4695159">As a matter of fact, each one of these Acts provides that until that entryman does all that he is required to do in terms of residence and settlement, and pays for the land, he has nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.461" offset="4754301">Thus when an entryman failed, his entry was canceled and the statutes that each of them provides, the land goes up again for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.825" offset="4783767">Beneficial title never left the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.741" offset="4795470">If it had left the tribe, instead of restoring the lands to the tribe, it would have taken an Act of Congress to convey the lands from the United States to the tribe.</text>

            <text syncTime="1563.847" offset="6355920">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.405" offset="6366056">The United States is appearing this afternoon as amicus curiae in support of the position of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, that the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.630" offset="6407016">We think that under the principle set forth by this Court in previous cases, particularly in Seymour, Mattz, and DeCoteau.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.851" offset="6435855">It is clear that the Acts of 1904 and 1970 and 1910 did not disestablish the boundaries of the Rosebud Sioux Reservation in the areas to which they apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.461" offset="6478278">I would like to note briefly at the outset one important general point, in suggesting that Congress did not disestablish the boundaries of the Reservation in the early 1900s, we do not mean to imply that Congress expected that those boundaries and the boundaries of comparable Reservations were going to continue indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.351" offset="6561870">We agree that in the early 1900s, Congress contemplated at some period of time that the Reservation system would in fact come to an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.535" offset="6602621">But we believe that time was when the trust period on Indian allotments expired and the assimilation of Indians and White settlers on the lands had been accomplished.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1636.639" offset="6647029">In you view it would have taken an Act of Congress later than to…</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Bartow Farr</label>
            <text syncTime="1640.609" offset="6662911">That is correct, that Congress at some point would have found that the assimilation had occurred, and would have passed an Act demolishing the Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.629" offset="6691019">At that point, all of these lands and all of the people on it, except if the federal government wished to retain jurisdiction over the Indians, would have gone within state jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.361" offset="6729889">In 1934 however, as the Court is aware, the Congress reversed that policy, it went and passed the Indian Reorganization Act and indefinitely extended he trust period on the Indian allotments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.359" offset="6773879">I will discuss that more briefly in connection with the General Allotment Act of 1887.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.214" offset="6805331">Because this case involves an issue of statutory interpretation, the United States does not urge or perhaps even believe its possible for this Court to lay down a binding fixed rule that would govern construction of Acts on all similar cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.789" offset="6863636">However, we do believe it is appropriate for this court to reaffirm the principle that except where the language of an Act or the compelling legislative history shows a clear intention by Congress to contract Reservation boundaries and limit federal jurisdiction over certain areas of Indian Reservations, that whenever Congress, without a binding agreement, opens lands to White settlers, does not pay for them, and does not guarantee any payment, but only agrees to act as trustee for future uncertain sales, and leaves the property interest in the Indians, as they did in this case, that Act does not remove the lands from the boundaries of the Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.975" offset="7032387">As this Court said in Seymour, discussing an Act with a very, very similar terms, the purpose of the 1906 Act was neither to destroy the existence of the Reservation, nor to lessen federal responsibility or jurisdiction over the Indians having tribal rights on that Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.780" offset="7111590">Now, this principle that Congress did not intend to disestablish the Reservation does not warrant that the government is made up out of whole clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.468" offset="7142310">It is supported both by history and by the previous decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1765.296" offset="7161641">To begin with, it is well recognized that the tribes are entitled to rely on certain rules of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.878" offset="7187972">In particular, doubtful expressions are to be resolved for the benefit of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.668" offset="7211169">More particularly, in cases of this type, the intent to disestablish Reservation boundaries must be made clear, either from the Act or the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.641" offset="7255055">And as this Court said on Rice v. Olson, the policy of leaving Indians free from state jurisdiction and control is deeply rooted in the nation’s history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.808" offset="7299672">All of these rules of construction apply to the case at hand.</text>

            <text syncTime="2046.826" offset="8287832">Although respondents in their brief have continually turned the General Allotment Act on its head, saying that it embodies the intent of Congress to disestablish Reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.846" offset="8327852">This Court has considered that precise question in several recent cases and found the opposite intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.377" offset="8353974">We believe the Court correctly identify the intent of the General Allotment Act only last term in Moe v. Confederated Salish &amp; Kootenai Tribes, in which it quoted from that with approval, the following language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.168" offset="8409145">“Its policy, that of the General Allotment Act of 1887, was to continue the Reservation system and the trust status of Indian lands, but to allot tracks to individual Indians for agriculture and grazing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.692" offset="8463270">When all the lands had been allotted and the trust expired, the Reservation could be abolished”.</text>

            <text syncTime="2119.966" offset="8580299">In fact, respondents have said that the Sioux Act was in fact followed along from that general plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.689" offset="8615198">We think that, that indicates the Court has recognized an intent to retain jurisdiction and control over those lands during the trust period, with the consideration of whether to end the Reservation to be made at a later time when the assimilation had occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.841" offset="8675803">We think the Court has noted that even more specifically in the cases in which we very heavily rely on our brief, Seymour and Mattz, and also in DeCoteau, which distinguishes both cases in a case where sale is made for a sum certain, and an agreement was made as the counsel for the tribe has discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.947" offset="8760230">In addition to these guiding principles, we also feel that the legislative history and the administrative treatment that we have set forth in our brief supports the position of the tribe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.929" offset="8804221">The remaining question then is, what is their sufficient to override this and the materials that the Court has before it?</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.585" offset="8830865">Most importantly, we call the Court’s attention to the fact that there is nothing in the Acts that says specifically that jurisdiction over these areas was to be given to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.178" offset="8869213">In fact, I think as a reading of the legislative history shows, Congress was really not concerned with the jurisdiction at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.870" offset="8899933">The pressure on Congress was to open up lands for White settlers for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.024" offset="8920622">One, the settlers wanted the lands, and two, the counties wanted a greater tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.433" offset="8942252">Both of those objectives could be met perfectly comfortably by Congress, by opening lands within the Reservation boundaries, without sacrificing the principles of the General Allotment Act of 1887, which was to continue the Reservations during the period of assimilations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2234.212" offset="9037337">I do not believe that there is any dispute about that, that was considered at that time, and I believe that even now would be considered land that is within the power of the states to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.012" offset="9088537">In DeCoteau in fact, discussing this particular conflict of policy, the Court said in 1887, the General Allotment Act was enacted in an attempt to reconcile the government’s responsibility for the Indians’ welfare, with the desire of non-Indians to settle upon Reservation lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.155" offset="9169099">We submit in this case that the best way to reconcile, that was in the way that Congress did reconcile throughout this period, was to continue the Reservation system, but to open White lands so that they would have a taxable base for the county, and the Whites would have the additional lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.308" offset="9233674">For those reasons, as my time is getting short, I will close and simply suggest that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2306.866" offset="9327923">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.722" offset="9343388">If I can, for beginning here, start out and refer again to the map that frankly is in the brief of the tribe, for the appellant in this case, because there were several questions by members of the Court concerning the areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.984" offset="9392394">This particular area where my left hand is over is Gregory County, which is affected by the 1904 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.258" offset="9429487">This particular area where my hand is now over is Tripp County, South Dakota, which is affected by the 1907 Act, and where you see these two counties stacked on top of each other, or I should say one on the other, the top county is Mellette County, which is affected by the 1910 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.880" offset="9496047">There is absolutely no dispute in this case with respect to Todd County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.258" offset="9513497">While the state of South Dakota, the tribe, the federal government, I think it is the only time we have ever all agreed; we clearly agree that that is an Indian Reservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.531" offset="9546621">Even though there are fee patented lands on it, we feel that that is the type of situation that the Court was addressing in Moe, when it construed the Subsection 6 of the General Allotment Act, and not Subsection 5 of the General Allotment Act, or Subsection 12 of Act of 1889.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.215" offset="9617360">So when the government a moment ago was responding that this is the situation in Moe, the Court construed Subsection 6, and it is this type of Reservation in the Todd County area, which is implored as the checker board kind of problem that the Court has addressed itself too before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2395.159" offset="9681099">But that is not the situation with respect to Mellette, Tripp, and Gregory.</text>

            <text syncTime="2768.587" offset="11174781">In Mattz and Seymour, both of them, this Court handed down a rule of construction of these Indian treaties and these Indian statutes that are past.</text>

            <text syncTime="2789.864" offset="11259940">It found that the Act, there was some question about it, went behind the face of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.148" offset="11277076">As a matter of fact, they found there was no question about it, but still went behind the face of it, and used legislative history and surrounding circumstances to support the decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="2830.372" offset="11422003">The only difference is that this is un sum certain and there is a great distinction being made about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.901" offset="11448126">In the Dakota case, the tribe was told and knew exactly what they would be paid for their land.</text>

            <text syncTime="3227.880" offset="13012025">The Lone Wolf decision came down in 1902, which came in right in between the time the Indian people first signed the Act and had the three-fourths signatures, and the next time around when they signed it in 1903 or 1904.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.679" offset="13071166">In the Lone Wolf decision, this Court very clearly took care of the problem of signatures being required for disestablishment of Reservations or anything else, because what you had in the Lone Wolf case was a place where they required three-fourths also by previous agreement, and the government did not get it, they only got the majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.361" offset="13153922">Congress passed an Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.479" offset="13158415">They went to the Supreme Court and this Court held that Congress had that plenary power, and that they did not have to stick to three-fourths, but they could use a majority.</text>

            <text syncTime="3302.314" offset="13309716">So as a result, these people turned around -- Lone Wolf said that Congress would not exercise this power that it had without using it in a wise way or a judicious way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.872" offset="13351930">They sent McLaughlin back out there when they never had to.</text>

            <text syncTime="3353.498" offset="13514516">The Lone Wolf did away with that particular necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.239" offset="13529458">You can go through the legislative history, and if you examine the government’s brief and you examine the tribe’s brief, you find criticisms of what went on in the Congress, but you cannot find any substantive legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.749" offset="13579509">There are hundreds of documents that pertain to it, that are both in the joint appendix as well as the individual appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.556" offset="13602705">I draw your attention to the document at 629, I believe it is, Page 629 of the joint appendix, which is a House Report, which just lays the whole thing out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.085" offset="13640844">There are about six pages there which just lays out in detail exactly what it was that was happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.294" offset="13661638">It lays out that these reservations were being disestablished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.763" offset="13679505">Although I was asked the question before, the cession is not the key aspect, whether or not there was a cession frankly is not even relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.998" offset="13704478">The question is what was Congress’ intent?</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.689" offset="13715241">Did they intent to disestablish the Reservation? Because if the answer is no, we got three new counties in South Dakota that belong to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.091" offset="13752857">The Rosebud Reservation has been quadrupled in size.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.463" offset="13762366">If the answer is yes, the Congress intended to disestablish the Reservation, then the answer is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.968" offset="13780338">We live with what we have lived with for the last 60 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.402" offset="13790056">So that is the key issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.184" offset="13797265">That is the crux of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3424.996" offset="13800505">That is what Mattz has taught us, and frankly, that is what DeCoteau has taught us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.758" offset="13815551">They have laid down that particular criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.360" offset="13825896">The uncertain sum in some arguments that has been raised, there is a lot of issue that because the Indians did not know ultimately what they would get that somehow this uncertain sum created -- completely, substantively changed these types of arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.011" offset="13888485">It is not clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.237" offset="13893396">All the Congress was doing was changing the method in how people were going to be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.684" offset="13911264">That is the only thing that Congress was doing, and they say that over and over and over again in these reports.</text>

            <text syncTime="4154.850" offset="16719845">All it was was a vehicle to facilitate the change.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.808" offset="16731757">They say that over and over and over, and not even the Indian people objected to that, at the time that these conversations went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="4165.381" offset="16761954">Everybody understood what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.475" offset="16774389">I understand the Court wants to go home, I have got time, but I would not use it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.156" offset="16785151">Unless there is any question, that is all that I have.</text>

            <text syncTime="4184.875" offset="16840008">I have listened to the Attorney General’s conversation, and much of it is a certiorari, not supported by the record, not supported in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="4193.591" offset="16874803">I would indulge the Court not to give heed to these White statements that are being made.</text>
            <text syncTime="4203.863" offset="16915972">We do have a principle established, and it is DeCoteau, and it is Mattz, and it is Seymour, and if those principles do not control, then every one of these 20 Reservations that we found with identical statutes to Rosebud, is going to have to be decided on the basis of things that are extrinsic to this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.225" offset="17009386">I did not hear the Attorney General explain to the Court what that last of our statutes meant, where the United States said it was not a purchaser.</text>
            <text syncTime="4235.915" offset="17044181">You cannot avoid, you cannot get title if you do not buy it, and that includes the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.107" offset="17076887">Nor did the Court of Appeals touched that statute, nor did it touch that section, nor did the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4251.284" offset="17105621">When the Court looks, the reference was made here to a 1903 Agreement, they did go back and get an agreement from the Indians in 1903, and got a majority vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="4266.802" offset="17167688">But significantly, Congress did not put that in the 1904 Act, the one they put in the 1904 Act was the one where they got the three-fourths majority, because that was the only one that was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="4278.729" offset="17215440">Lone Wolf simply says that Congress has the constitutional power to do what it wants with Indian land without Indian’s consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4289.932">Lone Wolf does not substitute a majority for three-fourths.</text>
            <text syncTime="4294.048">Thank you.</text>
