            <text syncTime="73.461" offset="397249">This case is in appeal from the judgment of a divided three-judge court in the Eastern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.388" offset="428910">The challenge statutes in this case, afford statutory right to United States citizen parents which makes it possible for them to live in this country with their alien children.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.303" offset="480632">It does so by allowing the parent to request an exemption of his alien child from restrictive numerical quota and labor certification requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.974" offset="531310">As fully explained in our reply brief, the recent amendments to the Immigration Act now the scope of this case respectively to the issue of the United States citizen parent seeking the classification of his alien child as an immediate relative and thus exempt from labor certification and quota requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.543" offset="629530">While other similarly situated parents made proof their family relationship with their children and thereby obtain their entry into the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.186" offset="672162">Citizen fathers of illegitimate children are completely precluded from proving their parent-child relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.054" offset="707584">Thus, Cleophus Warner, even though he has formally acknowledged his child always supported his child, lives with his child, loves and cares for his child is completely unable to prove his relationship with his child and to achieve his goal of living with his child in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.867" offset="806849">This case is unique one in the immigration law context on several grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.331" offset="836733">First and foremost, this case involves the rights of citizens not of aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.622" offset="865886">The challenge statutes were designed to achieve the benevolent result of allowing a United States citizen parent to live together with his child.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.984" offset="911339">But the statute discriminates against some United State citizen parents, the fathers of illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.946" offset="943208">In doing so, the statute infringe on these citizens fundamental interests in their parent-child relationship and as a possible consequence the incidents of their citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.901" offset="1011022">Mr. Warner is put to an impossible choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.038" offset="1035473">He may give up his desire to care for and live with his child and be able to live in this country, the country of his citizenship.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="246.255" offset="1088345">Well, is that an impossible choice?</text>
            <text syncTime="248.932" offset="1099107">Can’t many American citizens live in other countries so isn’t it impossible or rather strong word to apply to it?</text>

            <label>Ms. Janet M. Calvo</label>
            <text syncTime="257.071" offset="1131708">For Mr. Warner, it is in a serious -- by impossible, I mean very serious infringement on his choice to live in the United States, the country of his citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.580" offset="1185729">In fact his citizenship was a very hard earned one as Mr. Warner is a naturalized citizen of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.378" offset="1220838">He chooses to live in this country and he has made that know by becoming a naturalized citizen and living here for many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.695" offset="1266186">Another factor which makes this case a unique immigration case is that the legislative history discloses the total absence of any foreign policy concerns or a Congressional choice to exclude or expel a group of aliens who are perceived to post a threat to our national security or to our general welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.407" offset="1384991">Illegitimate children are not an excludable class under the statute and therefore there is no determination that they are any danger to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.742" offset="1442356">These factors demonstrate that this case is fundamentally different from any of those prior immigration cases upon which the government relies.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.330" offset="1504737">There is no question but that the actual and expressed Congressional purpose in passing the challenged statute was to allow citizen parents to choose to live with their alien children in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.517" offset="1577462">But the statute presumes that a citizen father will never have close ties with his alien illegitimate child and will never want to choose to live with him in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.123" offset="1707865">This is not a normal argument in this case, we get it in good many cases and I find it always very difficult to follow.</text>

            <text syncTime="409.664" offset="1742033">I think there is -- maybe the difference is between classification and purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.395" offset="1764916">There is nothing in the legislative history which evidences -- any other intention as an overriding purpose on behalf of Congress other than allowing parents to live with their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.516" offset="1837432">Of course to the extent that a certain group is left out at the classification system, they therefore intended it by omission to leave them out.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.933" offset="1923114">We feel that if in consideration of the overriding purpose of Congress, if they new that a man like Mr. Warner who has acknowledged his child and always cared for his child and lives with his child would be totally barred from proving his relationship with his child and completely barred from living with his child.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.781" offset="2010467">They would have intended that result because what Congress was basically concerned with was allowing citizen parents to be united with their children in the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="554.988" offset="2323310">You could say in a case in which a legislature said that we are building a school for white children, we do not want black children to attend that.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.805" offset="2382555">That basically fulfilled their purpose because that was the way the classification was drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.322" offset="2400632">What we are saying is that from the legislative history, Congress specifically stated that by creating a statute they were intending to promote the family unity of the United States citizen and we are further contending that the classification which leaves out the fathers of illegitimate children does not promote family unity and in fact --</text>

            <text syncTime="671.117" offset="2787871">Yes it did go part of the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.149" offset="2799992">It did go part of the way by presuming that parents similarly situated to a citizen father of an illegitimate children -- of an illegitimate child who always have close ties with their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.833" offset="2858715">For example under the stepparent provision of the law, if Mr. Warner married, he would be presumed to have close ties with his wife’s illegitimate child.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.412" offset="2913050">Ties that he is presumed never to have with his own child, and on the other hand, his wife would be presumed to have close ties with Serge his illegitimate child, ties that the father himself is presumed never to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.196" offset="2996120">This is similarly true under other provisions of the statute, a father who fortuitously lived in a place where an action on his -- by himself, he was capable of legitimating his child.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.591" offset="3061739">For example, by a simple acknowledgment would be presumed to always have close ties with the child while a man like Mr. Warner who has not only acknowledged the child but always supported the child and lives with the child because he doesn’t happen to live in such a place is completely precluded from even proving his parent-child relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.140" offset="3163930">Also an adoptive parent, a prospective adoptive parent and the mother of an illegitimate child under the statute are presumed to always have close ties with their children while the father of an illegitimate child no matter how close his ties maybe in reality is totally barred from proving his close ties and its presumed not to have this close ties.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.758" offset="3282422">Basically, what we are contesting is this total barring under the statute, especially in this case where the fundamental interest of a parent in the care and companionship of his child is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.795" offset="3366536">Mr. Warner’s case illustrates it, he is -- because of the abandonment of the mother, the only parent this child has and he is willing to take responsibility for that child as he always has and wishes to live with the child in this country in order to do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="900.211" offset="3704247">But in any event the challenge potential -- the alleged potential for his spurious claims does not justify the discrimination in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.826" offset="3750640">This is because any potential for his spurious claims in the case of a father of an illegitimate child is no different than the potential for spurious claims for many other parents who are covered by the challenge statutes.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harold R. Tyler, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1225.603" offset="5005772">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.556" offset="5025625">I think it is in a common place of course in the -- as a backdrop to this case that Congress need not allow the admission of any aliens much less need Congress grant immigration preference to any aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.225" offset="5084244">The core of this case of course has to do with the latter that is with preferences which Congress attempted to achieve by classifications adopted first in 1952 and most importantly for this case of 1957 and Section 101 (b) (1) and (2).</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.753" offset="5166373">Very briefly, the Government complains that these are classifications which Congress has the primary jurisdiction to adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.498" offset="5201377">They are rational and they are related to illegitimate immigration purpose unless they do not offend the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.727" offset="5242232">Preliminarily, I might say that there is certain things which the Government contends are really not involved in this case though one might assume so if you were to listen to some of our arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.027" offset="5291447">I think as the plaintiffs concede, although I am not certain, but I think Ms. Calvo said this, this is not a case where illegitimacy standing along or fathering an illegitimate son or daughter standing alone works in exclusion or a bar under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.034" offset="5371486">Nor as to the case where classification is simply a routine distinction or a simplistic distinction, if you will, between man and the one hand and females on the other hand, and finally, I might note this is not a case as plaintiffs parent still argue where the preference provisions were designed to unify all families.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.008" offset="5463437">We contend rather that the apparent intent of Congress if you just look at the plain language of the statute was to reunify families to the extent rationally feasible where there have been separations particularly caused by our immigration laws or some of them and especially where those separations were most likely to cause unusual hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.010" offset="5555388">In short, we urge that Congress Act did not haphazardly but discreetly and with care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.251" offset="5584332">For example, as this already been brought out, Congress decided that children legitimate or otherwise over 21 or married get no preference at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.411" offset="5633024">Congress similarly decided that children who have been legitimate after they are 18 years of age get no preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.936" offset="5675133">Similarly, Congress decided that children adopted after they are 14 years of age get no preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.726" offset="5710242">They decided that stepchildren made such by a marriage after they are 18 get no preference for admission to these shores.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.178" offset="5744097">And of course for this case, as the Court well knows preferences by virtue of the definition of parent and child go only to the mother and her illegitimate child and not to the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.907" offset="5803029">Now, obviously I assume once we look at it with reasonable care we have to accept that if nothing else is clear a mother has once been re -- has once been united with her child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.395" offset="5856946">But, surely, Congress had in mind that fathers necessarily never were united.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.189" offset="5884113">And I think this is a legitimate concern particularly where you are dealing with a father who has never chosen to legitimate his child prior to some point where an attempt can be made to petition for entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.575" offset="5941687">Now, there can be no doubt about it as the plaintiffs argue and as the Court knows what Congress did here was setup a presumption but we urge that it is a presumption based upon a rational empirical judgment or classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.691" offset="6010128">Furthermore, we urge that Congress quite obviously made this judgment or cut on the basis of difficulties approved for paternity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.929" offset="6039071">And there is no lawyer where the smidgen of experience who doesn’t know what the difficulties are proof of paternity I assume, and of course the likelihood of spurious claims as Ms. Calvo has pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.771" offset="6094451">Now, we do not urge here that just because this is an immigration case or it’s a case arising under the INA that this Court has no right to look at the case, of course it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.376" offset="6140844">What we do urge is that the plaintiffs have the burden of proof of showing that the classification or cut by Congress in deciding who was to be preferred and who is not to be preferred by defining children and parents that this classification or cut is irrational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.214" offset="6212211">They fail in this burden we submit for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1530.998" offset="6227362">First, as it has been pointed out to you early and often this afternoon alone by others in the Illinois case, illegitimacy has never been held squarely by this Court to be what is called a suspect classification, for this reason and because we are concerned with the admission of aliens, a matter obviously or primary jurisdiction of the legislature, strict judicial scrutiny is neither necessary nor appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.649" offset="6341987">As the Court has held recently in domestic cases, drawing of lines is peculiarly a legislative task and it’s a task where perfection is neither possible nor necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.428" offset="6393083">Now this is the rule of course that has been annunciated for cases involving citizens who have the full panoply of constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.304" offset="6432580">A fortiori, we would urge it is probably the outermost limit that one could reasonably ask for an alien who is seeking preference for admission to our country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.922" offset="6483048">Let me conclude if I may with two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.395" offset="6504991">As if almost to recognize their difficulties in the main issues, plaintiff seem to resort to the claim that the parent and child definitions herein issue somehow invidiously impact upon the constitutional right of a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.739" offset="6574373">Apparently, that is a right which I guess they call as I read their brief, a right to a unified family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.176" offset="6612093">Well, I have two arguments to raise against that if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.291" offset="6632573">First of all, I am not sure that this is a right which has been recognized in the Constitution and perhaps in a more specialized argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.046" offset="6683564">It seems to me that one reason we urge upon the Court consideration of the fairly recent case Kleindienst versus Mandel which to be sure involved First Amendment rights of a citizen and an alien’s context to and extent simply because Professor Mandel, as you remember, was seeking to be admitted to speak here and to converse with academic people and other who wanted to hear him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.751" offset="6782412">And there as I understand this Court it recognized that if the constitutional rights of citizens were to prevail in cases which involve the decision by the legislature or the executive under delegation by the legislature to exclude or keep out aliens, then the Congressional power to determine such exclusion which we all I think concede exist would really work out to be a note.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.421" offset="6897037">And finally, if it may please the Court, I notice that an oral argument as in their brief plaintiffs, once again contend that somehow this case presents no foreign policy issues or choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.070" offset="6955656">In other words, in 1957 as I understand the argument, Congress didn’t sit down and then someway either in the actual statutory language or in some thing that we all are trained to call legislative history, utterances that this is a great matter of foreign policy or some foreign policy choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.162" offset="7048025">I thought that argument had been put to rest by Mr. Justice Jackson 24 years ago in Harisiades when he pointed out that when Congress makes these cuts and when Congress determines who is excluded and who is admitted and then the reasons why that that kind of a cut or that kind of classification by necessity goes to the heart of our relation with other governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.066" offset="7155649">This is a good illustration as Ms. Calvo has properly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.211" offset="7172263">One of the problems here is that a good deal depends upon the laws of other jurisdictions who gets admitted under the statute or other sections of the Immigration and National Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.895" offset="7215000">Well, General Tyler, you say in your brief that the basis for this action in not giving the preference to an illegitimate child of a father -- of an unwed father is that the child is among the class or that two -- or that the classification -- that the father and the child are members of the class among whom its unlikely, there would be any real close identification and it’s on this basis that the legislature at Congress decided which families to try to reunify which family is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.813" offset="7386676">Now, why -- I suppose you would concede that there would be enough of that -- could many father child relationships even though the child is illegitimate where there has been a very close -- very close.</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.204" offset="7464208">Congress apparently was relying on two propositions which even the plaintiffs sociological and statistical studies which they mention in their briefs don’t really dispose of this, I see it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.485" offset="7517288">First of all even the studies of a recent advantage referred to by them and referred to by Judge Weinstein in his dissent show that the overwhelming number of families, the natural relationship as Congress obviously opted for here is with the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.924" offset="7587088">But you’re quite right, we can’t claim and perhaps the Cleophus Warner family situation is a good illustration.</text>

            <text syncTime="2252.000" offset="9111385">In Mathews versus Lucas, distinctions were upheld specifically because they did not completely and totally foreclose a group from proving the objective or the necessary of objecting that case which was dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.814" offset="9210650">This was compared to the case of Jimenez in which the classifications were very similar, but the group of people in that case were totally precluded from proving dependency which was the object in that case also.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.416" offset="9292988">In this case, there is a stereotype that fathers of illegitimate children don’t care a whit about their children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2307.390" offset="9332903">I believe that we have shown in our briefs that this stereotype just isn’t valid that there are many, many fathers who do care about their children and our particular concern in this case is with our plaintiffs who do care about their children.</text>
