            <label>Mr. Richard N. League</label>
            <text syncTime="43.894" offset="276074">Thank you your honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.670" offset="279209">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.260" offset="289553">I am Richard League from Raleigh, North Carolina to argue this case for the petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.271" offset="309615">This case had hopefully involves a long-shot in the criminal justice process, possibility of a broken plea bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.888" offset="348067">The case began back in January of 1972 in Alamance County, North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.792" offset="371682">At that time, Gary Darrell Allison entered a plea of guilty to a charge of safecracking or attempted safecracking.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.050" offset="404701">In accordance with our state procedure, he was examined to determine whether or not his plea was a voluntary and intelligent act and as part of that proceeding, he was asked several questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.901" offset="456110">One of which determined that he knew the maximum punishment for his crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.448" offset="474291">Another was designed to determine whether or not there had been any promises made to him in order to secure his plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.738" offset="507414">He said that there had been.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.377" offset="517968">At the conclusion of this proceeding, the trial judge accepted his plea and entered a sentence of 17 to 21 years for the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.232" offset="561435">Sometime after that, he began Post-Conviction proceedings in the State Court and ultimately, in March 1973 filed an application for writ habeas corpus with the United States District Court for the Middle District in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.325" offset="629772">In that writ, he alleged that his plea had been induced by a promise of ten years by his lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.881" offset="664044">This of course was opposite of what he told the trial judge and he told him that no promises had been made to secure his plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.793" offset="699675">At first, the District Court dismissed the writ then it reopened the case and after some correspondence with the petitioner about substantiating his claim, he claimed that he had a witness to his lawyer’s offer to him of this ten-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.418" offset="766131">The district court again dismissed his claim for failure to supply an affidavit with regard to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.956" offset="792253">On appeal, the Fourth Circuit reversed the District Court and held that a form of inquiry was used addressing the accused to determine whether or not any promises had made and was non-reliable way to go about this and also condemned the District Court’s attempt to have the matter substantiated by way of Affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.095" offset="880861">We are here before you today to assert as a central thrust of our argument that the Townsend v. Sain, authorized the District Court to accept the State Court findings on this manner that there were no promises made for the petitioner’s plea and to adjudicate this habeas corpus petition on the basis of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.885" offset="964035">As far as reliability goes, there has not been much law developing in this aspect of the decision in Townsend v. Sain or the statute that declares the law with regard to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.430" offset="1010219">But it was a sworn proceeding that somewhat differentiates it from those Rule 11 enquiries as I understand them.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.143" offset="1037073">It is a proceeding in which the petitioner himself solely testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.818" offset="1059747">It was also a proceeding that covered the matter involved whether or not there had been a promise for his plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.576" offset="1090781">With regard to the attacks on this type of enquiry, I hope that the court will understand them to be a largely matter folklore rather than fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.435" offset="1138219">It developed from impressions made I believe in the Metropolitan Northeast in the mid 50’s and the early 60’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.006" offset="1172492">To some extent, they are based on a study done in the Midwest in the 1950’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.344" offset="1193808">I think a misinterpretation to that study.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.340" offset="1213870">A gentleman named Mr. Newman who was frequently quoted with regard to the matter of guilty plea has observed a series of arraignments at that time and found that in none of them did anyone answered to response about promises say that the District Attorney promised him a sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.850" offset="1287849">That of course I do not believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.029" offset="1292551">It is a remarkable observation because you would not expect that.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.803" offset="1307702">Certainly, you would not expect it in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.834" offset="1327764">I would say to you that whatever validity that these observations and attacks on this type of proceeding that use had at one time, they are pretty far removed in time and space from North Carolina in 1972, the time of course, when Allison entered his plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.369" offset="1397981">Since that time or between that time 10 to 15 years time difference we had the Brady decision by this Honorable Court which specifically incorporated as the part of the definition of the volunteer civically.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.338" offset="1453883">Knowledge of the actual value of commitments made to an accused by this day and of course that was picked up and some of our cases, well before Allison’s plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.554" offset="1506650">One of the reasons asserted for finding that the enquiry was not reliable made by Mr. Goldsmith, was that the word “promises” was the one that was capable of being narrowly construed by a lawyer with regard to his client or in advising his client and the client would therefore say that there were no promises to him, and although he was aware of a deal, he would not concede that as a promise.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.380" offset="1622007">But I believe that that is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.594" offset="1626813">I believe that ordinarily, you would expect a man no matter how the matter was phrased, no matter whether the word promise was used to him or not to conceive of a deal as a sure thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.124" offset="1669027">They conceive of it in terms of a promise whether or not that word was not used.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.473" offset="1690343">Also, another reason given for not accepting the State’s proceeding in this case was the fact that a man might not speak up.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.752" offset="1731512">He might not admit in court to either there was a bargain or that, after it was breached that it was breached, he would for some reasons stay silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.841" offset="1775816">But again, I would ask your Honors to recall that man you are dealing with and not especially assorted people.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.786" offset="1807581">They were after all the men who will rob you or kill you or assault you and you can certainly expect that a fair number of them would not speak up and certainly, we were able to find a few instances out there and have included them in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.206" offset="1877275">With regard to this particular matter, I think that if the court were to depart from Townsend v. Sain and were not to allow the District Court to accept State Court findings in this context but significantly undercut one of the basic reasons for two of its subsequent cases, in McCarthy Case and the Boykin Case, certainly, one of the hopes behind each of those cases was to cut down post conviction work or to expeditiously handle it.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.255" offset="2001514">Other courts go by the board and do so for a type of claim that I do not think that a lot of people give much credence to.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.416" offset="2034115">In Machibroda of the United States, this court did not describe this type of claim in very high terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.060" offset="2060760">The Courts of Appeal who have looked at it and a number of them are even in remand for hearing have indicated that they did not think that it was very high likelihood of the success with regard to the matter below, at least from the petitioner’s point of view.</text>

            <text syncTime="1372.675" offset="5591156">The only question that we are concerned with and the only one that could possibly have any relevance to the issue of plea bargain and the existence of a plea bargain in this case is question number 11, “As his lister or you lawyer or any policeman, law enforcement, or law officer or anyone else made any promise or threat to you to influence you to plea guilty in this case?” And the only space provided is for a yes or no answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.283" offset="5673599">There is no space provided for the terms of a plea bargain if one existed and furthermore, on the reverse of the form, the Trial Judge is required to find because it is printed on the form that he find that the plea was entered voluntarily and without promise of leniency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.807" offset="5727724">So, it implies on the very form itself under the old and I stress this is the old North Carolina procedure, there could have been no planning of any promise of leniency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.121" offset="5764923">The plea would have been stricken, and therefore, it is not unreasonable to suppose that a defendant would be expected to answer “no” to those questions before there has been any promises or threats made to induce him to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.724" offset="5811421">I think it is significant, the wording of promises or threats, the two are coupled together as though that is in proprietarily can be expected to be denied and I think that is in fact how the North Carolina procedure was conducted during this period of time, prior to the Fourth Circuit decisions and the later legislation which changed our proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.560" offset="5890729">It is not unreasonable at all to expect the defendant in that situation to denote to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.660" offset="5911104">This was not simply matter of my speculation on this part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.624" offset="5926987">There is authority cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.224" offset="5933360">There is an authority in fact cited in the petitioner’s brief in this case to support the propositions that an answer like that is routinely given and even counseled to be given by a defense attorney in order to have a plea accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.108" offset="5988949">It has been substantiated I believe in two articles, at least two articles which include empirical research, introduced with judges and lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.845" offset="6019878">One in the Yale Law Journal, a 1975 article by Professor Alschuler, entitled “The defense attorney’s role in plea bargaining,” at 84 Yale Law Journal, 1179.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.492" offset="6066480">Another one in 1970, Washington Law Quarterly at page 289, the Trial Judge’s dissatisfaction as to volunteer in his understanding of guilty pleas and both these articles evidence cited in tenant’s support what is well known to any practitioner at that time in North Carolina, that plea bargains were never disclosed in response to such a question on such a form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.117" offset="6140982">Plea bargains were routinely made and entered into.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.537" offset="6154670">There was nothing improper about plea bargains, but they simply did not ever appear on the record, they were never disclosed in response to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.062" offset="6188733">There is another fact I think is significant in this case and that is the fact that this plea colloquy in the sentencing of the defendant occurred only 37 days after this court’s decision in Santobello and to the extent of Santobello legitimized plea bargaining or was used by the Defense Bar in general as having legitimated plea bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.040" offset="6264593">Then I think it is not unreasonable to assume that Santobello had not had time to take an affect in North Carolina and that this plea bargains were not normally made a part of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.501" offset="6310464">I would further point out that the only record of this matter, the state of the record now is simply this sheet of paper and that is simply not an adequate compliance with the requirement, not necessarily of Townsend v. Sain, but also of the Congressional requirement that there exist inadequate record to permit the view.</text>

            <text syncTime="2689.825" offset="10859741">I submit that the state of the record presently is simply insufficient to ascertain that that was determined irrevocably that there would be no plea bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.618" offset="10894954">I think one other factor I want to call the court’s attention to that, I did not cite my brief and that is the official commentary to the North Carolina general statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.387" offset="10930062">The statutes themselves are set out in my brief, the ones that, the amendment to Chapter 15(a) of the North Carolina Criminal Procedure Act which required an open court disclosure plea bargains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.150" offset="10981053">I think it is significant to note the official commentary which is reprinted with those statutes and that is the purpose of the statute was to legitimate plea negotiation and “to bring plea negotiations out of the back room” and further, their own the writers of the official commentary say that the purpose is now intended to allow the defendant to tell the truth in plea proceedings, implying that perhaps in former times the defendant was not always expected to tell the truth in response to that type of question in plea proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.504" offset="11086484">The same type of comments that I think were found in the amendments to Rule 11(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.862" offset="11111979">I think it simply points out that this is a new day, this is taking pleas out of the dark ages and that this plea arouse in the dark ages of plea bargaining when these things were not brought out in open court and were not explicitly recognized as being constitutionally sound.</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.123" offset="11892936">As a question, I think it has to be resolved by the trial or fact in an evidentiary hearing where credibility can be tested, but no one to date has approached as far as I know, either the defense lawyer or the persecutor or any other party to the case to ascertain what there version of the facts is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3008.743" offset="12135457">I can speak of personal knowledge as to whether or not that is stayed in the post conviction applications on the basis of this type of claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.058" offset="12164714">It has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.396" offset="12170043">Maybe this made them somewhat easier to deal with, but that is speculative too at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.045" offset="12192613">With regard to the question Mr. Justice Stevens posed about the absence of an affidavit from the attorney or from the District Attorney in this case, at the time this case came through, the case was handled to the extent it needed be handled except in the Charlotte division of the Western District.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.856" offset="12271920">The matters where routinely dismissed on the basis of a showing by the state that this transcript of plea had been going into or rather the inquiries made in the transcript to going into and the man that said that no promises were made for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.816" offset="12331793">To the candidate it was not an act, it was not expressed, the dismissals were not expressed in terms of taking a state court finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3065.386" offset="12361991">I think they were expressed more in terms of being blatant or lacking sufficient credibility to cause the court to move.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.945" offset="12392293">That is the basis for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.232" offset="12397413">Certainly, I had the foresight to know I would be here today the case would be handled quit a bit differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.819" offset="12423744">With regard to the matter of the form that was used, the fact that it had no place to include on it any promises that had been made, of course that form was not a maximum inquiry form it was a minimum inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.600" offset="12494902">You see, the forms coming through attached to writs sometimes, a question which dictates it, and more questions were asked by the judge and at that time you get a verbatim transcript, assuming one is available as it usually is, but unfortunately it was not in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.890" offset="12559999">Frequently, you see, an answer to the question is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.433" offset="12570239">Are you under the influence of any alcohol, drugs, or medicine?</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.892" offset="12584031">Of course the inquire proceeds is just what you are under the influence of what turns out to be a tranquilizer or some sort of medicine.</text>
