            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100533">In the Califano case, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held that neither -- that although Section 205 (g) of the Social Security Act did not authorize judicial review of a decision of the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare not to reopen a previously adjudicated claim for Social Security benefits, Section 10 of the Administrative Procedures Act is an independent draft to District Court's of subject matter jurisdiction to review that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.981" offset="272419">We agree with the Court of Appeals that Section 205 (g) of the Social Security Act does not authorize judicial review of the decision, but we disagree with the Court of Appeals that Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure Act does authorize that review.</text>
