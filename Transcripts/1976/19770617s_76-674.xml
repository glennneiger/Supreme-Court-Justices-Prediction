            <text syncTime="12.949" offset="152274">This case arises out of an attempt by petitioner, a national bank in Nashville, Tennessee to foreclose a mortgage on property owned by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.867" offset="195951">Respondent contends that the mortgage is not in default and therefore brought suit in a Tennessee court to enjoin the foreclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.871" offset="228030">In preliminary proceedings, the trial judge concluded that there was a bona fide dispute over the default issue and that a wrongful foreclosure would cause irreparable harm to respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.184" offset="269199">He concluded, however, that a federal statute enacted in 1873 deprived him of power to enter an injunction against the national bank in advance of final judgment, even though such relief would have been appropriate against the state bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.770" offset="331579">The Tennessee Supreme Court reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.339" offset="341819">It held that the federal statute was intended to protect the bank and its creditors from the issuance of certain prejudgment writs but it did not apply to a bank's attempt to acquire property from one of its debtors by foreclosing a mortgage.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.219" offset="401378">We granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.958" offset="412350">In an opinion filed with the clerk, we review the early history of this statute, the three cases in which this Court has previously construed it and conclude that the judgment of the Tennessee Supreme Court should be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.987" offset="460415">Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice White have joined.</text>
