            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments next in number 1510, Weatherford against Bursey.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.935" offset="287117">Mr. Coleman, you may proceed whenever you’re ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. J. C. Coleman</label>
            <text syncTime="48.962" offset="299238">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.627" offset="317837">I am going to take a little of my time to review the facts which I realize are already in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.486" offset="349288">However, I do think it’s important for this reason to show a little more clearly the relationship between the two principles in this case And when I say the two principles, I am speaking of Weatherford and Bursey, although of course Strom is a defendant and was the South Carolina Law Enforcement Chief.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.313" offset="464645">These events occurred, the events leading up to this litigation occurred in 1970, approximately at the end of a period of several years of dissension and on the college campuses of this country and I believe other parts of the world as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.496" offset="549386">Weatherford was a salaried undercover police agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.977" offset="571329">I think that’s important to remember in this case, not controlling but important.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.165" offset="604035">He has been referred to in the case as a paid informer and I guess in the broad sense, he was, but nevertheless, he was a hired, salaried member of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division assigned to undercover work as opposed to an informer who might be paid by the job or by the persons he turned in.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.660" offset="714062">He was not that type of individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.648" offset="729945">He was also a student at the University of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.290" offset="748544">His principal assignment was to report to the other defendant, Strom who was and is the Chief or Head of the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division which is of course, the Chief Police Agency or State Police of South Carolina other than the State Highway Patrol.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.800" offset="850526">The Plaintiff Bursey, the plaintiff below Bursey, of course, was a student at the University of South Carolina and the two became very close friends.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.211" offset="892217">They were not simply acquaintances.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.437" offset="905070">They visited each other in their homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.690" offset="918131">They associated with each other in various campus activity groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.685" offset="946134">I believe the testimony in the record shows that at least on one occasion, Bursey and Weatherford were co-chairpersons, I don’t know where group, on the campus of the University of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.095" offset="1003708">The record would show further, I think, that Weatherford later married a very close friend, a roommate of Mr. Bursey’s wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.103" offset="1047803">So, they were much closer than mere acquaintances and we think that that is important in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.223" offset="1088240">This association went on and of course, Bursey was completely without any knowledge that Weatherford was an undercover agent and the two, together with two other persons, who do not really enter this case except that they participated in the event in March of 1970 In order to demonstrate their opposition to the Vietnam War afflicted considerable damage to the personal property and the real property of the Selective Service Office, the Draft Board in Columbia, South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.983" offset="1259290">Admittedly, Strom, the police chief had been given prior notice of this crime by Weatherford.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.877" offset="1302862">Weatherford did participate with Bursey and two others in the crime and although there were police agents in the building, who had been placed there in order to either stop the crime or capture the criminals, were unable to do so and the four persons escaped.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.504" offset="1409337">That was early in the morning hours, I believe, of March 20, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.384" offset="1424906">Later that same day, from information furnished to Chief Strom by his undercover agent Weatherford, Weatherford and Bursey were arrested on the campus of the University of South Carolina, charged with the crime of malicious destruction of personal and real property, a statutory crime under the Law of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.435" offset="1525112">Both were jailed on the same charge and Weatherford soon thereafter was released through an arrangement made by Strom and Bursey stayed in jail, I believe, for some 12 days before he was enable to put a bond and obtained his release.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.049" offset="1615600">Thereafter, and I think the record is clear on this with certain testimonials, although there was not a specific finding of fact by the trial judge on this particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.357" offset="1664815">It was decided and it was desirable from the State’s viewpoint to have the undercover agent, Weatherford continue as an undercover agent on the University of South Carolina Campus as long as he could because he was a valuable man according to the testimony and at that time, I believe, the testimony is that he was the only agent, only undercover agent on the University of South Carolina campus in the employ of SLED.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.102" offset="1803786">It would have been impossible with the very close relationship between Weatherford and Bursey, for Bursey to have been -- to reveal himself it would have been impossible for him to do anything unusual without raising very great suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.835" offset="1890722">And in order to see that Weatherford was not forced to deal with Bursey’s lawyer or he was not forced to make an explanation as to why he did not wish to be represented by Bursey’s lawyer, an explanation that would hardly have been plausible, the State Solicitor John W. Ford arranged which was admittedly a false arrangement for one before a local attorney, Frank Taylor, in Columbia a well-known attorney to pose as Weatherford’s attorney in this particular charge.</text>

            <text syncTime="528.656" offset="2217984">He arranged for this false representation or dummy representation, however, it might be put by Attorney Taylor of Weatherford and that’s admittedly for the purpose of maintaining Weatherford’s cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.478" offset="2301262">Thereafter, both men went about their normal life with the exception or the inclusion whichever it might be, of two meetings.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.520" offset="2357478">There’s some mention of maybe a third meeting but no particular testimony with regard to the details.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.454" offset="2389138">I think the testimony read as a whole indicates there were two meetings at which Bursey was present, his attorney, Mr. Wise from Greenwood, South Carolina approximately 70 miles from Columbia was present and of course, Weatherford was present.</text>

            <text syncTime="609.061" offset="2539604">That was admittedly not a true situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.466" offset="2565204">There were two meetings involving the plaintiff Weatherford or the plaintiff Bursey, Weatherford and Bursey’s attorney, Wise, one was at a party at Bursey’s house, I believe it’s described as an ACLU party, it makes no difference except that it was a social event.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.979" offset="2651303">And during the course of that social event, I believe the testimony is that Weatherford and Bursey and Bursey’s attorney, Wise got away from the majority of the crowd somewhere out in the field somewhere and did go into a discussion of this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.093" offset="2731760">There’s a finding of fact by the Circuit Judge that Weatherford never did categorically and specifically denied that he was an agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.080" offset="2771675">There was quite naturally in a case like this, there would be and there was in this case, a general discussion between the three as to whether or not an informer or undercover agent or something of that nature might be involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.124" offset="2843878">There was some discussion by Weatherford of that in response to discussions by the other two.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.856" offset="2882748">Weatherford I believe did state upon, maybe on that occasion or maybe in another, but he did state that he would not testify in the case against Bursey.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.871" offset="2930813">That would normally come up because I think in every criminal case involving multiple defendants, there’s always a question of whether one is going to be approached by the authorities and asked to tie-in State’s evidence in a plea bargaining situation and Weatherford denied that, I think it was necessary that he do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.764" offset="3026422">He had to do that or either state that he was going to testify and had he made such an assertion as that, I’m quite sure that his cover would have disappeared completely and he could no longer have operated as an undercover agent on the campus.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.957" offset="3095176">And I think that’s true whether or not Bursey and his attorney might have deducted from that fact that Weatherford was an agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.981" offset="3135300">His effectiveness, certainly, would have disappeared whether he was an agent or whether he simply was going to testify to save his own skin at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.731" offset="3186291">I think it’s clear that this meeting was without question, arranged by Bursey.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.830" offset="3210742">It was not sought out by Weatherford.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.550" offset="3221608">Not in any degree and with the closeness, the close personal relationship of these two men, it would’ve been impossible for Bursey to avoid such occasional contacts as these.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.484" offset="3285347">I think rather than being against Weatherford, it’s rather to his credit that he limited such meetings to only two during these nearly four months period between the time of the crime and the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.007" offset="3351385">Now the only other occasion, as I recall the evidence, that there was a meeting between the three, that is Weatherford, Bursey, and Bursey’s attorney, was on an occasion that was brought about entirely by Bursey and his attorney Wise.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.883" offset="3426931">The testimony shows that, and their own testimony shows that they came to Columbia without having made prior arrangements, not even giving prior information to Bursey that they were coming, I mean, to Weatherford that they were coming and went to Weatherford residence and he was not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.514" offset="3509478">They guessed that he might be at the house of a friend of Weatherford, went there and as it turned out, he had been there and would return very soon and did return.</text>

            <text syncTime="917.568" offset="3773628">They were necessitated by a legitimate state interest of the State to maintain Weatherford’s cover and of course his own legitimate interest to maintain that cover plus the fact that there was some fear in some people’s minds that his life might be endangered if his cover had been blown at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.663" offset="3890030">Now, the Fourth Circuit does hold as I read it, that the mere presence of Weatherford at these attorney-client meetings constituted a per se Sixth Amendment violation of the effective assistance of counsel and the Black and O’Brien cases are cited as authority for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="973.753" offset="3998386">The Coplon and Caldwell cases from the District of Columbia Circuit are cited in support.</text>

            <text syncTime="989.448" offset="4061184">As far as this particular point is concerned, that is the violation of the constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel, I can’t see or I stand to be corrected that it makes a lot of difference whether this Court sent those cases back simply for a hearing on whether or not there was damage of prejudice or whether they sent them back for a new trial really for the same purpose and I think it’s the same thing, insofar as this particular point is involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1549.151" offset="6299982">The other big question of course with the fair trial issue and the Fourth Circuit rule as we understand it that the simple neglect of the state to inform the defendant Bursey or his attorney that there was an eyewitness in the case which had not been previously known, was sufficient in itself to constitute unfair trial and violation of the constitutional right and of course would have supported a reversal of the conviction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.321" offset="6564655">I have not thought out that process to the point of taking that prima position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.951" offset="6587225">We are on that position of course, that’s number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.925" offset="6603107">Number two is that even if he had, and could show a violation now and that the action has been brought, we took the position in the Circuit Court, that it did not state a course of action and of course, that was overruled by the Circuit Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.839" offset="6682728">The third issue decided by the Court which I wish to get to very briefly is the liability of Chief Strom as opposed to that of Weatherford.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.683" offset="6722121">It’s clear, I think, that the defendant Strom did not know that Weatherford was actually attending conferences between Bursey and his attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.265" offset="6772381">He did know and he did order, of course, the maintenance of the cover in that he was fully aware of the fact that Weatherford was going about his business and had not revealed these things to Bursey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.191" offset="6828178">But the record is clear that he did not know that there was any conference between Mr. Bursey and his attorney and we feel that the Fourth Circuit was clearly in error in ruling that he either did know it or should have known it in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.273" offset="6920443">We think the Fourth Circuit puts the knowledge of Strom on the wrong set of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.457" offset="6945207">It puts the knowledge of Strom on the fact that there was a maintenance of the cover when it’s clear that there was no knowledge on the part of either Strom or the Solicitor Ford, for that matter, that there had been attorney-client attendances by Weatherford.</text>

            <text syncTime="1745.438" offset="7085119">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.069" offset="7099643">Reading through the briefs of this case and the opinions below, one is struck by an almost schizophrenic character that the case has assumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.253" offset="7132348">It has in effect three different faces.</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.424" offset="7145096">First, is the case described in the findings and conclusions of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.906" offset="7162964">Central among them are the findings that the State’s motive in allowing petitioner Weatherford to proceed as he did, was to protect his cover, so that he could continue investigations of other matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.659" offset="7206013">Secondly, that the State initially hoped to make its case against respondent without Weatherford’s testimony and that the decision to call him as a witness at trial was a last minute decision by the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.478" offset="7257318">Third, that Weatherford’s role in the conversations with respondent and his lawyer was limited, involved no attempt to secure defense strategy information and entail discovery of little that was surprising or highly significant about the respondent’s defense strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.112" offset="7327848">And fourth, that no information acquired by Weatherford during these meetings was conveyed to the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.299" offset="7356583">And the second case is that perceived by the Court of Appeals which accepted virtually all of the facts found by the District Court but applied a radically different legal analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1825.983" offset="7407261">They were all accepted yes, but substituting certain per se requirements for the balancing of interest approach that the District Court took.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.332" offset="7444668">And the third case is that of painted by respondent in his brief in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.740" offset="7462327">The case is malevolent contrivance by the State to spy upon and sabotage his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.194" offset="7492106">Our position in this case is based essentially on the facts found by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.336" offset="7512691">And our concern in this case is with the legal principles announced by the Court of Appeals to govern those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.170" offset="7548008">Accordingly, I will not address at any length the factual controversies with which this Court is confronted except to make two observations in passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.569" offset="7581654">The first is that, it seems to me difficult to sustain the notion that petitioner’s actions in this case were motivated to any significant degree by an attempt to secure advantage over respondent in his prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.761" offset="7642467">With petitioner Weatherford’s testimony available, the State’s case was secure and it’s difficult to perceive as a practical matter how the state could’ve imagined it would strengthen its case by nondisclosure of Weatherford’s status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.664" offset="7702026">The second point seems to me quite ironic in light of respondent’s present posture in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.267" offset="7724492">The disclosure of Weatherford’s status as an agent of the State Police, far from helping respondent’s defense was fatal to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.159" offset="7760018">Respondent’s best hope of acquittal lay in a decision by the prosecution to maintain Weatherford’s cover past the trial, rather than to reveal his status by allowing him to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.696" offset="7806203">Had Weatherford done what respondent now insists he should have done, the hopes for a successful defense would simply have been dashed sooner than in fact they were in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2454.143" offset="9919927">So, when the Court of Appeals stated that it was of no consequence that the intrusion here was not for the purpose of information, but was to maintain Weatherford’s cover, we think it unjustifiably slighted important societal interest in protecting the flow of information about crime to law enforcement authorities and the safety of undercover agents and informants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.853" offset="10006758">And we’ve argued in this case that certain critical factors must be examined in determining whether a Sixth Amendment violation has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.896" offset="10046986">The most important of these is whether the so-called intrusion into defense counsels is active or passive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.748" offset="10074363">A violation should be found in our view, whenever there’s been a deliberate effort to penetrate the defense camp, so that the prosecution may acquire defense strategy information that can aid it its adversarial struggle.</text>

            <text syncTime="2512.253" offset="10152417">A constitutional violation; I am not -- I am a little uneasy about resting it on the Sixth Amendment and I have to hark back to cases like Herring and in Faretta where the Court is somewhat divided on whether what the roots of some of these rights are.</text>
            <text syncTime="2529.157" offset="10220022">But I do think it would be constitutionally impermissible for the prosecution in this manner to invade the defense camp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.758" offset="10250428">Now, a violation also may occur when there has been an actual acquisition by the prosecution by whatever means of defense strategy information, and Coplon and Black are examples of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2548.148" offset="10295986">Now, I haven’t very much time remaining but I want to make a couple of points that have come up in their briefing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.116" offset="10319809">One is the notion that the Court of Appeals fear to entertain that the undercover agent is a member of the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.222" offset="10348231">I think that notion is wrong in the context of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2565.274" offset="10364426">Respondents cites a number of Brady type cases and those are cases where I think the notion of the prosecution being held responsible for knowledge of the police is far more appropriate because those are cases in which what is at stake is a direct impact on guilt or innocence by the withholding or the availability to the defense of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.930" offset="10455124">Now, this is not a case of that sort and it seems to me that if the Court can find in fact that a barrier has been established, a quarantine around the agent’s contact with the attorneys and that is not been transmitted to the prosecution at any form that it could be utilized, there would be no violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.960" offset="10535163">I also think that the reasons for whatever per se rule there may be in Black and even O’Brien don’t extend to this case, first of all, there’s a distinction between cases that involve intrusions in cases that involve prosecution access to defense information and these cases are discussed in respondent’s brief and many Court of Appeals cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.460" offset="10637249">I think what one can distill from these cases is that where the prosecution has acquired defense strategy information, and when this fact does come out until the trial is ended and therefore can’t be explored in the context of the criminal trial itself, the remedy has been to order a new trial and that’s what happened in Black at least and a number of the other cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2659.171" offset="10740067">Now, on the other hand, where there’s been an intrusion, but there has not been established that information has reached the prosecution and the prosecution may thereby have gained an unfair advantage in the trial process itself, there has been not a per se rule but an inquiring into prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.695" offset="10818121">We think this is a case on the findings of the District Court where you have the intrusion perhaps but not the unfair prosecutorial advantage that has been gained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.592" offset="10869739">Now, I just want to comment then briefly, if I have a minute left, on the second point decided by the Court of Appeals, which is the just the duty imposed upon the prosecution to disclose the identity of an undercover agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.892" offset="10926895">Now, Brady which the Court principally relied on is plainly inapplicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2710.418" offset="10945076">This is not an exculpatory evidence case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.219" offset="10960227">The holding of the Court of Appeals in this case amounts in our view, logically can only mean that any damaging exculpatory evidence must be produced by the prosecution in advance of trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.697" offset="11014144">The policies to which the Court of Appeals referred which are set forth at page 262 of the appendix are first to consider whether plea bargaining might be the best course.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.036" offset="11051551">Well, I’m sorry I seem to have run out of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="2749.638" offset="11101915">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.550" offset="11125530">I concur in Mr. Coleman’s observation and I agree that the District Court made no direct finding that there was a need for cover in this case and I think that a review of the record will conclude independently that as a factual matter, there was no need for cover and Strom himself testified on several occasions during the federal trial precisely to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.670" offset="11246007">The District Court judge at one point asked Chief Strom whether or not there was anything that Weatherford was working on that would require the maintenance of his cover following Bursey’s arrest and Strom said that there was nothing that he was working on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.221" offset="11312253">And Strom in response to questions from counsel on cross-examination stated that, furthermore, he was fundamentally unconcern about his agent’s cover being blown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.611" offset="11369827">And the reason he was unconcerned was that he doubted whether Weatherford could be effective after the arrest of any of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.756" offset="11398353">There is also a suggestion in the brief of the Solicitor General that there was some concern about the agent’s life or that he might be done physical injury, Weatherford certainly never indicated that he was in fear for his life or that that was the reason his cover was being maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.071" offset="11471705">In point of the fact, Strom offered him protection and Weatherford declined the offer and moreover, had Weatherford’s position as a law enforcement agent been truly compromised, then he never would’ve been offered the job by Strom and never would’ve considered that he himself could’ve accepted such a job and still been an effective law enforcement agent.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laughlin McDonald</label>
            <text syncTime="2875.537" offset="11605556">I think it was after he testified, Strom offered him a job of so-called “above the ground” kind of agent, to use Weatherford’s phrase, and he declined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.980" offset="11643277">He decided to pursue graduate studies instead.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.515" offset="11653413">But Weatherford himself said that he felt in time, he could be effective as an agent in almost any other capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.319" offset="11676609">But Strom’s testimony was quite explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.317" offset="11688626">There was nothing that Weatherford was working on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.174" offset="11696044">I think the argument really is one of the generalized convenience rather than any demonstrated need and of course, the District Court made no specific finding in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.287" offset="11736482">Not only does the record not substantiate that there was any need, but the record really doesn’t show that Weatherford did anything other than what he did in this case, it could be concede of as a benefit to law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.637" offset="11793951">There was, for example, evidence in the record that he participated in vandalism at the administration building of the University of South Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.559" offset="11825612">That he went to Atlanta, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.833" offset="11834702">I can’t conceive why his state law enforcement duties would take him there but nonetheless, he went there to interview about going to Cuba “to check up on radicals,” to use his phrase, but he never made a single arrest as a SLED agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.106" offset="11883813">He testified in only one trial and that was Mr. Bursey’s trial and he could not remember a single assignment which he had been given which led to a conviction other than Bursey’s.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.132" offset="11927907">So, I think that to the extent that an argument of law enforcement need has made here completely collapses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.988" offset="11951313">But even if there was a need for cover, I think that the decisions of this Court clearly indicate that that State interest can never be exerted over a defendant’s right to the effective assistance of counsel and fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.232" offset="12028322">One of the reasons that is true is because there are other less intrusive ways for a State to protect its legitimate interest in secrecy, if in fact, it had one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.662" offset="12070013">One way, as this Court knows would be simply to forgo prosecution, but Strom himself suggested another way in which this problem could be solved and that is he simply would’ve taken his agent off the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.644" offset="12121945">As a matter of fact, Strom himself conceded that what had happened in this case was in his judgment a violation of the constitution and he also said that it was unethical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.462" offset="12173249">Of course, he said that he didn’t know that intrusion was taking place.</text>

            <text syncTime="3130.304" offset="12624541">Solicitor Ford, for example, said that there was another agent and there was so many of them that he didn’t know who was working for whom, but there was an agent who was unavailable to testify and was out of the country.</text>
