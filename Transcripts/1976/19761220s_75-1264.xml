            <text syncTime="18.035" offset="172655">In this case, a Dortha Guy was filed fired by her employer when she failed to returned to work properly following a sick leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.575" offset="206823">She filed a grievance alleging that the company's action had been unfair and this grievance was resolved against her.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.328" offset="233781">She then filed a charge of racial discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1974 with the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.233" offset="265442">A statute of that time required that such claims be filed within 90 days of the allegedly Discriminatory Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.575" offset="294804">Ms. Guy's claim was filed 108 days after she was fired although less than 90 days after company rejected her grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.813" offset="327718">Ms. Guy then filed suit in the District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.266" offset="345586">That Court dismissed her action.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.337" offset="353840">She appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and that Court affirmed the judgment of the District Court finding that she was not entitled to bring this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.485" offset="394487">We agree with the Court of Appeals that the fact that Ms. Guy resorted to her independent right to file a grievance with the company did not extend the 90-day period for filing a claim under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.911" offset="440149">We disagree with the Court of Appeals' conclusion, however, that the subsequent change in the period from 90 to 180 days does not help Mrs. Guy.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.813" offset="475780">We find that the language of the statute gives her the benefit of the 180-day period since she did filed her claim with the EEOC within 180 days of the date she was fired.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.228" offset="517367">We therefore, reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.740" offset="531473">Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Stevens have file a separate statement in which they agree with our disposition of 180-day limitation issue but would not address the other issues which we decide.</text>
