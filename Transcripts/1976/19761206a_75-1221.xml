            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments first this morning in number 75-1221, United States against Consumer Life Insurance Company and the two other cases consolidated with that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.486" offset="169357">Mr. Smith.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="19.005" stopTime="179.065">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="19.005" offset="179388">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.997" offset="191404">These three federal income tax cases are here on writs of certiorari from the United States Court of Claims and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.283" offset="232469">Two cases, Consumer Life and Penn Security are from the Court of Claims and the First Railroad cases from the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.840" offset="262771">They present a common question whether these taxpayer insurance companies meet the definition of a life insurance company under the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.920" offset="315016">Our tax system provides a marked preference for our life insurance companies insofar that it grants them a narrow tax base.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.540" offset="365484">The Court had previously considered the effect of that narrow tax base about ten years ago in the Atlas Life Insurance Company case.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.867" offset="398817">Now, other stock insurance companies such as those engaged in the sale of non-life insurance such as cancelable accident and health or casualty insurance are taxable at annual -- on their total annual net income as any other corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.394" offset="460988">But life insurance companies have this preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.056" offset="471646">So it is today a decided advantage to qualify as a life insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.242" offset="496306">But like most taxpayers, that is like most insurance companies, the taxpayers in these cases do not deal exclusively and either life or non-life insurance but in a combination of those two types of insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.284" offset="560462">So Congress, since 1921 has provided a mathematical test in the statute designed to limit the preferential life insurance company tax treatment to those companies whose predominant business is the assumption of life insurance risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.799" offset="630575">And it is done so by in Section 801 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code which represents essentially the same statute that is existed for some 55 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.782" offset="682506">Essentially the statute provides that reserves are the appropriate measuring rod for determining whether an insurance company is a life insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.968" offset="727228">The statute provides a fraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.109" offset="739767">The numerator of which is life insurance reserves and the -- for purposes of this case, and the denominator of which is total reserves and in order to be a life insurance company to qualify for this preferential treatment, that fraction has to be more than 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.503" offset="801416">It’s like your life insurance reserves have to be more than ½ of your total reserves.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="179.065" stopTime="182.611">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="179.065" offset="819597">That’s simply a matter of statutory definition of what is a life company.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="182.611" stopTime="183.701">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="182.611" offset="833808">Exactly.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="183.701" stopTime="193.906">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="183.701" offset="838196">And it’s a -- basically a life insurance company is an insurance company that more -- that does more than its half, more than half of whose business is life insurance measured by its reserves.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="193.906" stopTime="194.848">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="193.906" offset="878947">That’s correct Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="194.848" stopTime="196.394">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="194.848" offset="882813">Is that it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="196.394" stopTime="374.190">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="196.394" offset="888978">Now the question in this case, in these cases that is, focuses on the quantity of the denominator in fraction that is total reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.337" offset="932760">These cases present the question as to whether certain cancelable accident and health insurance reserves which are reserves on what is indisputably non life business are includable in these taxpayers’ total reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.061" offset="991587">It’s also undisputed that if it is includable, is that these accident and health insurance reserves are included as we submit, these taxpayers fail to qualify its life insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.110" offset="1039862">And if they are excluded as the Court of Claims held and it’s the taxpayers’ submit, then they do qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.437" offset="1073089">Now, the case focuses on the effect of two different types of transactions which are presented in combination in all three cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.872" offset="1122826">For purposes of convenience, we have referred in our briefs to these transactions as Treaty one and Treaty two.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.469" offset="1153233">This is the nomenclature of the Consumer Life Insurance Company case which presents both of those types of reinsurance transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.579" offset="1193671">Consumer, as I said, presents both kinds of transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.270" offset="1212479">Penn Security presents a Treaty one type arrangement and the First Railroad case presents only a Treaty two type arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.742" offset="1250304">Now, we submit that the facts demonstrate with abandoned clarity that the accident and health insurance business was attributable to the taxpayers, so that the accident and health insurance reserves are includable in the total reserves of these taxpayers, so that their denominator is increased and the fraction falls below 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.044" offset="1339538">So the end result as of our submission is that the Court of Claims was incorrect in holding that these companies qualified as life insurance companies and the Fifth Circuit was correct in holding that the taxpayer in that case did not qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.136" offset="1399933">I think it probably would, instead of stating the facts of each case theory items, since they are essentially similar, it probably would be helpful to put the facts before the Court in terms of the Treaty I and Treaty II generic type transaction, because, as I said, the arrangements in all three cases are essentially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.883" offset="1474853">Now, the Treaty I type transaction, the taxpayer insurance companies, that is Consumer Life and Penn Security, are subsidiaries of corporations engaged in the consumer loan business.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.233" offset="1524276">This accident and health insurance that we’re involved with here is credit accident and health insurance, because when this people borrow money from a consumer loan business, they generally are encouraged by life insurance and accident and health insurance, and yet --</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="374.190" stopTime="379.949">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="374.190" offset="1600136">There is -- may I interrupt you.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.609" offset="1605778">There is no question here about the term life insurance that a borrower takes --</text>

          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="379.949" stopTime="392.437">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="379.949" offset="1623124">No Mr. Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.093" offset="1631796">I think that was resolved in the Alinco case that that is life insurance and we’re not disputing the correctness of that decision of the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.940" offset="1671084">When a --</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="392.437" offset="1673070">There is also a term accident and health insurance, single premium, isn’t it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="395.458" stopTime="691.298">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="395.458" offset="1685191">Exactly; that’s what is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.268" offset="1692400">When the borrower -- you know let’s say, borrows $1,000, he is encouraged to purchase a life insurance contract which will payoff the outstanding loan balance, so its decreasing term in life insurance in the event he should die, or in the event that he should become disabled, the insurance is designed to continue to pay the loan payments during the period of his disability and it is a single premium as Mr. Justice Stewart indicated that is paid in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.932" offset="1811101">Now in most states, finance companies are prohibited to issue such credit life insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.342" offset="1840776">So, prior to the Treaty I type arrangements in these cases, the consumer finance companies essentially acted as sales agents for independent insurance companies and they receive the commission, which is a substantial condition usually in the neighborhood of that 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.257" offset="1924368">Now, the Treaty I type arrangements were organized by the tax -- by the consumer life -- the consumer finance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.296" offset="1952580">They organize these taxpayer insurance companies as subsidiaries in order to command a larger percentage of the profits from this credit insurance business.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.508" offset="2001377">But as the consumer, facts in consumer life insurance indicate, at first these newly formed insurance companies, the subsidiaries and in the case of Consumer Life it was the Consumer Life Company, did not have sufficient capital to act as a direct insurer on the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.838" offset="2066683">Under the state of the, you know, of incorporation of the consumer finance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.871" offset="2090820">So what it did was, they acted as reinsurers rather than direct insurers.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.389" offset="2112972">Now under Treaty I, the way the transaction worked was as follows: The independent insurance company issued the policies to the borrower and collected the premiums in full just as it had previously done before the taxpayer insurance company was organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.697" offset="2186115">And the taxpayer, by contract, by reinsurance contract which in the parlance of the industry is called the Treaty, agreed to reinsure the risk and agreed to reimburse the independent insurer for all losses, and I’m quoting “Actually paid on both life polices and health and accident policies.”</text>
            <text syncTime="542.182" offset="2272110">So, for purposes of this case, Consumer Life that is, the Treaty I type case, there really is no dispute between the parties although Consumer Life has argued to the contrary but there really is no dispute that under the Treaty I type arrangement these taxpayer subsidiary insurance companies assume the entire insurance risk for these -- before this coverage, because they, by contract, agreed to reimburse the independent insurer for all claims paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.995" offset="2391333">Penn Security doesn’t contend to the contrary and in Consumer Life, well, they do contend, they do dispute this assumption of risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.228" offset="2420276">The Court of Claims found that they freely conceded that they assumed the risk below, and as we point out in our brief, I don’t think there really is any question that they did so concede and that day have assumed the risk by contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.002" offset="2479417">Now in exchange for the assumption of this risk under the Treaty I reinsurance arrangement, the taxpayer, Consumer Life and Penn Security, received substantial percentages of the commissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.519" offset="2529468">Much more substantial than they had, you know, when they were just -- when the taxpayers didn’t exist and the finance companies were dealing with independent insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.698" offset="2562173">In Consumer, the percentage was 90.5% of premiums and the Penn Security it was 98% of premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.017" offset="2599476">Under the Treaty I arrangement, the independent company, as I said, collected the premiums in full and it also paid all claims under the policies as any direct insurer would.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.613" offset="2645870">Each month, the independent company remitted to the taxpayer insurance companies their full share of the life insurance premiums that had been paid by the borrowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.972" offset="2695293">But with respect to the accident and health insurance premiums, the independent company remitted to these taxpayers only that portion of the premiums that was readably allocable to the prior month’s coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.443" offset="2749106">So, for example, assume a $120 accident and health single premium that the tax -- that the borrower pays, that would mean essentially that the independent company would hold that $120 until the end of January and then on February 1st or shortly thereafter, would pay over $10 a month in February which is allocable.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.205" offset="2840221">January’s coverage and so forth, in March would pay over another $10 which was allocable to February’s coverage.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="691.298" offset="2868537">The way that you described that the initial or sometimes you referred to as the direct insurer is essentially like a general agent in the field who receives the commission for initiating the business whereas the risk taking is by the reinsure.</text>

            <text syncTime="708.910" offset="2938964">Essentially that’s our submission Mr. Chief Justice that for purposes of Treaty I the independent that insurer was really nothing more than a commission agent, because when the smoke clear it was all -- it only held its 9.5% of premiums everything -- it paid the claims out of this fund that was about to drop down and was -- and essentially that the taxpayers agreed by contract to assume the risk and everything that was left over, less its commission, was paid over back to the taxpayer -- to these taxpayer insurance companies.</text>

            <text syncTime="1153.152" offset="4716022">Now, to describe briefly what happened under the Treaty II arrangement, the roles of the taxpayer and the independent company were purportedly reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.816" offset="4754683">So the taxpayer becomes the direct insurer and the independent company, under this contract, is characterized as a reinsurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.530" offset="4789478">But under in the Consumer Life case, 80% of the accident and health business was purportedly reinsured with the independent company and then First Railroad it was 60% and then 70%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1185.848" offset="4846738">But what kind of reinsurance really was this arrangement?</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.246" offset="4860322">The way it worked was the taxpayer paid these quarterly accidents and health premiums to the independent insurer, take keeping back a tentative commission of 50%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.672" offset="4906088">The independent company then paid a quarterly rebate or it called it an experience refund, and that rebate was equal to the premiums less to 50% attentive commission which had already been received, less a 3% or 4% commission, well, 3% in Consumer Life, and then less all claims paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.684" offset="4994069">And if the sum of these three things exceeded the losses under the insurance -- losses to the payment of insurance claims, then those losses will be carried forward and the independent company would be able to charge it against the next quarters experience refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.234" offset="5064286">Now important fact in the consumer case, the loss experience was something like 18% of premiums paid, so there really was no way that the independent company was going to get more than its 3% commission or get less than its 3% commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.492" offset="5121337">In fact in the Consumer Life case, the trial judge found in the Court of Claims that the likelihood, that the loss experience would run so high that the 3% insurer commission would be jeopardized with so remote as to be negligible and that the parties knew this to be the fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.975" offset="5659251">Absolutely Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I would not quarrel with that proposition, but I think that a transaction has to have some independent substance, and here, where you have a situation where these premiums are just being held back and paid on a monthly dribble.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.362" offset="5724871">I mean, that is really the only way to describe it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.987" offset="5735320">I think that it is so to blink its reality to say that this A&amp; H business was not the taxpayers’ business, because they were on the risk; they got all the profits from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.429" offset="5793102">There was no way that the other company could loose and the other company was not really insuring anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.807" offset="5814627">I mean it was performing a function but it was performing a function in the one case to qualify under state, to qualify these transactions for state purpose and the other case was simply bold face attempt to qualify as a life insurance company under the fraction, under the statutory fractional formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.010" offset="5887457">Now, with respect to the Treaty II arrangement, the Fifth Circuit correctly held in our view that there was no substance to this agreement as reinsurance that was essentially the other company was simply earning a commission and doing a small set of tasks, receiving the premiums, paying out the claims, and getting no more than 3% and getting no less than 3%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.602" offset="5985782">We don’t think -- we agree that we don’t think that’s insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.896" offset="5998947">Now, the proposition that we urge in these cases is a very simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.782" offset="6022457">It is that for purposes of the Section 801 (a) reserve ratio test, insurance reserves must follow the insurance risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.931" offset="6059133">Since as I think is abundantly clear from the description of the facts, the taxpayers bore this accidents and health insurance risk under both the Treaty I and Treaty II type arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.165" offset="6099989">The accident and the health insurance reserves are includable and they are total reserves, that is the denominator of the statutory fraction, and they do not qualify as life insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.327" offset="6144711">Now, we think the proposition that reserves must follow the risk can be demonstrated in three different ways: First we think the rule comports with the fundamental characteristics of insurance and the essential nature of what an insurance reserve is; second, we think that the language of the reserve ratio test of Section 801 (a) and (c) supports our submission that reserves to follow the risk; and finally, we submit that the legislative history of the reserved ratio test as stating, which dates back to 1921, supports our submission that is insurance reserves must follow the insurance risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.350" offset="6304789">Now, with respect to the first point, I think it’s fairly undisputed and this Court so recognized it for about 40 years ago in the Le Gierse case that the essence of insurance is risk shifting and the essential characteristic of reinsurance is the transfer of risk from one company to another.</text>

            <text syncTime="2613.065" offset="10555643">I’m counsel for Penn Security in number 1285 and to just remind the Court our case presents solely a Treaty one situation because I think much of what Mr. Smith has just said has no barring on a Treaty one situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.655" offset="10613948">I’ll be followed by Mr. Harper for the First Railroad and he will be representing a taxpayer as a Treaty two situation and Mr. Masinter will conclude and his case includes both the Treaty one and the Treaty two issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.908" offset="10671000">I’m sure the Court is aware from its questions that what the statutory test says and that Penn Security meets the statutory test in terms of the reserves which it has on its books and which it reports to state authorities and which they have approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.186" offset="10724080">And I think it is also, I preferred nothing suggested by the Government that there is any way you can read the code or the regulations which would suggest to you that some other reserves maybe attributed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.408" offset="10769011">Rather as I see the reserves follow the risk test which has been expounded here this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.166" offset="10791999">It’s sort of a touchstone which is offered by the Government to better carry out the statutory purpose and the argument is really whether that new touchstone test can be reconciled with the statute and the regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="2716.432" offset="10969109">We feel that applying this test to Penn Security shows that it is a very unwise clause on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.282" offset="11004531">Penn Security which meets the statutory reserve test actually reinsures more life risk than accident and health risks, and that arises because they never sell accident and health without life.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.927" offset="11043088">They sometime sell life without accident and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.609" offset="11053850">In terms of what it cost them to carry the insurance, we have findings in our case that it requires company in order to meet the claims under the policies, it will cost them more to meet their life claims and to meet their accident and health claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.855" offset="11110797">Penn Security has no interest in the reserve funds which are held by this independent outside insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.975" offset="11131277">There is no way in the world that you can use the word shifting in talking about the reserves applied to the Treaty one situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.966" offset="11159280">Those funds come in from the policy holders to the direct insurer and the question is on accident and health insurance when they come over to the direct insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.746" offset="11194389">And in fact the eccentricities of the Government rule shown here by the fact that we do qualify for 1965 no matter what this court says here and indeed we have some arguments in our brief that maybe I’ll get to which shows why even if they attribute here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.334" offset="11256665">We’d still qualify as a life insurance company and we don’t think 15 years after the event, this kind of game should be played with somebody who is in clear compliance with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2797.807" offset="11294595">Perhaps, if this had been adopted as a regulation in an earlier date a case could be made for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.607" offset="11313821">Now, the Government doesn’t -- does not despite the use of the word sham, does not have any element of sham in our reinsurance agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.167" offset="11344018">This is an outside company which reinsures and indeed they say sham were not in the case, we don’t get the income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.105" offset="11363767">It’s only the reinsurance which gets income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.510" offset="11377455">And the Government makes much of the point that under this reinsurance agreement, all the risk shifts to Penn Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.725" offset="11410265">But that I suppose is always true and at least -- excuse me strike that, but the normal pattern of reinsurance and insurance company would like to get rid of all its risk under a policy and it’s quite natural that if it reinsures it will be taken off the policies in term.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.155" offset="11467943">It does not want to have the residual risk of the catastrophe which was mentioned here earlier and reinsurance has been around a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.326" offset="11500648">These arguments which the Government now proposes would throw a great monkey wrench into the reinsurance business if every time you reinsure a 100% you had to talk about shifting the reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.486" offset="11541295">And indeed, we submit and we think that one of the key elements that tells the Government that it’s really trying to make new law here as this revenue ruling 7508 and that’s a life insurance case and isn’t directly involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2872.317" offset="11592600">But you’ll see there that where the direct insurer actually paid over the income on the retained funds to the reinsurer so was a stronger cases sort of like economy finance where it did that, they still did not require attribution of the reserves there and as we pointed out in our brief there is a regulation which would give them license to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.856" offset="11682774">We think this is an ad hoc argument to try and as a last gasp to get at these credit life insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.163" offset="11712031">The terms of the reinsurance treaties at least in this Treaty one situation on arms length deal between the reinsuring company and the direct insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.763" offset="11746408">And the direct insurer has to make terms that will make -- will let him keep in the business by paying the right amount to the reinsurer and if he gets too greedy then they will go somewhere else so there is free bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.379" offset="11800848">And I don’t believe that it can be suggested any reason why once you to go into this reinsurance business you should not be allowed to cast it in terms which qualify you for the taxation with Congress has specified for life insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.573" offset="11853615">As Mr. Smith stated earlier it is not argued here that somehow credit life doesn’t fit within the 1959 statute and that is settled by the Alinco case and then by the Superior Life case in the lower court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.173" offset="11908054">Now, some focus is made and rightly so on the manner in which the premiums for accident and health are paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.096" offset="11951731">They are done on the – on as unearned basis while life is done on a paid over directly, but this is a term reached by the party and has several effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2974.656" offset="12001991">One which will be discussed more by my following counsel is what that does on the ability of the insuring companies to sell more insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.305" offset="12032606">It is important to them to have their reserves adjusted as it is always been the case on the handling of reinsurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.461" offset="12081194">There is a tax impact and that’s what brings us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.157" offset="12096031">But between the parties, this is perhaps the most important term of the deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.765" offset="12114422">If you look at the accident and health insurance and you can work this out on pencil and paper, if you have A &amp; H policies that last three years and you get your premium in advance from the insureds and you keep that money and you only have to pay it out once -- 136 for each month, you’ll find that the calculation builds up a fund times one-and-a-half -- one-and-a-half times the annual premium rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.579" offset="12217657">And that one-and-a-half times the annual premium rate is -- belongs to the direct insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.721" offset="12238242">He can invest that and if his rate of investment is say 5% you will see that 5% on one-and-a-half times the annual rate is a great deal more than the 2% commission which appears on the face of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.759" offset="12286412">So, I submit to the Court that this provision for retaining the reserves on accident and health is one of the most important provisions between the parties and has tremendous economic substance and could certainly not be disregarded under any standards that we have seen in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.401" offset="12352972">Now, our position is that this reserve follow the risk has no authority in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.215" offset="12376273">It's to be contrasted with Section 482 which does give the commissioner license to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.392" offset="12404903">We think it runs to the extent the code speaks at all on the subject of attribution reserves that goes the other way in Section 820.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.178" offset="12432071">Now, it’s not involved here, but it seems a little odd that If the rule were as the Government claims here that the reserves follow the risk that Section 820 would be written just the way it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.862" offset="12482853">And we find that the Government's attempt here runs afoul of four regulations requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.420" offset="12509080">One, that the premium -- in order to create unearned premium reserve the premiums must be paid in advance, that is one of the requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.896" offset="12538964">The second is that it must actually held.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.542" offset="12549517">The third is it has to do -- there are two aspects to it of being required by the state law, and finally whether if you do go to an attribution to this, you really want to use the gross A &amp; H premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.078" offset="12595702">Now in terms of paid in advance, we don’t have any dispute that that language in the regulations applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.716" offset="12618271">The Government suggests in its reply brief that this is satisfied as to Penn Security by the fact that the insureds paid there premiums in advance to the direct insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.964" offset="12663202">Well, I think that’s an extraordinary stretching of language.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.855" offset="12678771">Those premiums which were paid in advance had no relation to any liability of Penn Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.676" offset="12698102">Its liability to the direct insurer arose only when the premiums were paid monthly by the direct insurer to Penn Security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.462" offset="12729240">If the direct insurer did not pay those amounts, there would be no liability in Penn Security and if you are looking in terms of the regulations, the insurance risk which is referred to in the regulation about paid in advance very clearly refers to the reinsurance risk which is assumed by Penn Security, not the risk which the direct insurer assumes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.773" offset="12814503">Now, we come to the language which says that the reserve must be actually held and that’s discussed quite a bit in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.585" offset="12841671">The Government says reserves are sometimes described in colloquial manner as fund set aside, but that’s not the appropriate interpretation and we heard that this morning that they should be treated as liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.001" offset="12895378">Well, we agree that if you look through the insurance text throughout the country you can find some terms which speak this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.381" offset="12924844">But we think that the very use of the words actually held in the regulations meant that the -- in drafting the terms and the regulations, it was not suggested that anything other than funds actually held would be involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.717" offset="12998196">In other words, they adopted what have been described as a colloquial description and insisted on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.583" offset="13021706">If additional authority is needed, we would suggest that the Court look at revenue ruling 67 180 which makes it very clear that the IRS has continued to apply under 1959 act all those early cases which talk about funding a reserve, Maryland casualty being one of the leading cases, they also point out that Atlas Life case was mentioned here earlier this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.411" offset="13109060">Atlas Life makes it very clear that they are talking about a funding of a reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.502" offset="13125360">And indeed if you don’t fund the reserve, you are going to get in a very difficult situation where you create a liability that will be a very distorted picture of the company's position unless some assets are brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.287" offset="13180531">But let’s just go back to the statutory language, even if we concede that somehow you can hold a liability as opposed to holding an asset within the meaning of the regulation, what about the word “actually”?</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.328" offset="13232671">Its a word actually means anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.370" offset="13240822">It must mean that the company actually holds it, not that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue can come along10 years later and create a liability that you didn’t have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3294.499" offset="13281364">So, we would think that the word actually even if he is right about what it means reserves are funded or not, the word actually alone is enough to keep the Government from proceeding on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.976" offset="13331310">There two aspects to being required by state law and one of them arises under 801 (c) (2) where the Government correctly point out, you can read the statute and the regulations as not requiring Government approval under (c) 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3320.355" offset="13384808">But we don’t really conclude as the Government does that hear alone, among all the rules of insurance taxation in this very complicated section of the code, in this one place Congress intended the Commissioner of Internal Revenue to have a free hand to go around and make rules which improve on what the state authorities have done and give him a chance to make a better tax law than what the -- what would come from following the state regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.432" offset="13485119">That is just too contrary to the rest of the code and we would submit to the Court that a better reading is to say that the difference in language about state requirements is to accommodate the decision in National Protective Insurance Company which is cited in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.257" offset="13544364">There the taxpayer held the brief which was at least arguably not required by state authorities and that case held that it should be included in the reserve and we can see removing the requirement that it'd be required by state law in order to say if in fact you have a reserve, you are going to have to include it in the computation, whether or not it’s required by state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.439" offset="13625135">But it is a far cry to go from that to say that it -- this particular language choice gives the Commissioner power to do his own creating of reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3392.148" offset="13671946">As is apparent from our briefs, and it has been discussed, there is a difference between gross and net premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.301" offset="13696606">Accident and health insurance is judged on the basis of traditionally in the industry on gross premiums and that includes the morbidity risk which I would beg to differ with the Government counsel is just as well established as mortality risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.908" offset="13751045">Plus expenses, plus profit and in the type of insurance we are talking about here, the risk of carrying the insurance is only 1/3 and if you are going to attribute the risk, if that’s what the Government is really after then I think, you should depart from the statutory adoption of the industry practice and only attribute that port of the risk which corresponds to the mortality risk in life insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.661" offset="13842056">Because then as we have demonstrated here, it would be seen to this company as a life insurance company by that method as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.790" offset="13866506">Our point is that if you depart from the statute then it seems to me you’re not bound by the fact that states for many purposes require using gross premium and one particular reason which would apply here is that the direct insurer has the obligation to refund the premiums in the event the insurance is canceled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.736" offset="13938291">That’s one of the reasons for maintaining the gross reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.519" offset="13949471">Here, in our case Penn Security is not -- once that policy is canceled Penn Security never sees it and the refund comes from the direct insurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.638" offset="13981968">So there would be a very strong reason, if you are really looking for improving on the statutory test to use net premiums in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.454" offset="14021151">Well, just let me conclude and remind the Court of just how predominantly this company is an insurance company because of the fact that it meets the 50% test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.113" offset="14063783">It sold more life insurance than accident and health, had more life risk than accident and health risk and those reserves which are being attributed to it are clearly held by the direct insurer as an important part of the arrangement which of course is made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.928" offset="14127104">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3516.904" offset="14170990">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.377" offset="14220831">The Government is correct in appointing out that the Government provided a mathematical test, a ratio, but I believe it is subject to criticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.231" offset="14284257">We are not pointing out to you that the Congress has also passed a statutory framework for the analysis of these problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3554.921" offset="14323022">Not only has the Congress enacted law, but the treasury itself has explained many of the terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.262" offset="14368371">Without proceeding to the more orderly part of my discussion, I’d like to point out that it’s quite painful to me that the Government would come in and tell you that the statute said unearned premiums and meant reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.150" offset="14467950">Because I point out to you in Section 801 (3) (e) the treasury itself defined unearned premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.297" offset="14520508">Unearned premiums are those amounts which shall cover the cost of carrying the insurance risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.075" offset="14555721">I feel it is in fact a liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.066" offset="14571604">I don’t see how it’s going to cover the insurance risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.624" offset="14593860">I think they have aborted their own regulations and tried to ignore them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.614" offset="14613817">I point out may other differences, but before I do I’d like to discuss for a moment “risks.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.035" offset="14647463">It was appointed out by Mr. Justice Stevens that there are two risks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.692" offset="14674108">I’d like to point a third.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.399" offset="14684975">There is a distinct third risk and that is in having too small, an insurance base to adequately determine premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.498" offset="14737324">For example in our case here, there was evidence that a number of the agents had loss experiences that were above the 96%.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.694" offset="14782151">I point out to you that one of the risks is that you do not have a broad enough base to have a determinable premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.643" offset="14829902">And let’s talk for a moment about premiums and may I distinguish because it must be done, may I distinguish the risks of a life insurance and the risks of an accident and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="3697.888" offset="14894895">It has over the many years been clear that the life of a group of people was predictable, the mortality tables would so advice you, not as to one individual man but the death is a predictable thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3718.119" offset="14975875">The amount of a reserve for life insurance becomes an obligation because each day that inevitable death approaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.483" offset="15021328">The risk then is greater as time passes and man gets older.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.889" offset="15042957">It is entirely the opposite for accident and health.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.162" offset="15059989">Every month you get by, I think we are all happy while we made another month and we are not sick, I’m glad I’m not like old George.</text>
            <text syncTime="3748.906" offset="15098964">Every month that’s true of the accident and health insurance business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3754.540" offset="15121533">This is a risk not predictable upon the basis of actuarial certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3763.009" offset="15155388">A risk which is so indeterminate that the law requires that the entire unearned premium be set aside at the moment of sale, when you sell life insurance you can look at the premium you got, look at the mortality table, and you have earned some income at that moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3787.350" offset="15252773">In the case of accident and health it's not so.</text>

            <text syncTime="4452.264" offset="17912456">I’m counsel for respondent Consumer Life Insurance Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4456.797" offset="17930533">In this case, the Government seeks to reverse the holding of the Court of Claims and asks this Court to hold that certain unearned premium reserves relating to accident and health insurance should be attributed or imputed may actually be a better word, to respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4477.267" offset="18012453">Reserves which respondent did not hold, but were held by unrelated insurance company, reserves which respondent was not required to maintain pursuant to state law or state regulatory purposes, reserves which respondent was not required to maintain pursuant to standard accounting and actuarial principles applicable to this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4503.156" offset="18116002">Now, this case involves both the Treaty one and the Treaty two situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4509.351" offset="18140766">In the Treaty one situation, American Bankers Life Insurance Company was the unrelated company and it wrote the insurance and respondent was the reinsurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.013" offset="18187473">In the Treaty two situation, respondent was the insurer and the unrelated company was the reinsurer.</text>
            <text syncTime="4531.506" offset="18229373">The facts are un-controverted that the reserves where actually held by American Bankers, the unrelated company and that American Bankers earned the investment income on these reserves, and included these reserves in their reports for state reporting purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4551.102" offset="18307741">Both respondent and American Bankers were subject to regular tri-annual examinations by the state authorities of Arizona, Georgia, and Florida, and other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="4561.208" offset="18348178">And during the years at issue, none of these state insurance commissions required either respondent or American Bankers to change their method of reporting of these reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="4574.515" offset="18401468">As all the counsels seem to agree, the central issue here is the definition of reserves as set forth in Section 801 of the code as to which we believe there are two overriding principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="4587.914" offset="18455071">Firstly, that the test for qualification as a life insurance company is clearly set forth in the code as the reserve ratio test, that is to qualify as a life insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="4601.247" offset="18508361">A company’s life insurance reserves must comprise more than 50% of its total reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="4608.198" offset="18536155">And secondly, the Congressional intent is clear that state law shall control in matters relating to the substantive definitions of insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4620.675" offset="18586102">Nevertheless, in the face of these clear principles, the Government seeks attribution of these reserves on a very novel theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="4629.940" offset="18623091">This theory is that reserves follow the risk, a theory which we would submit goes beyond the clear wording of the statute and the intent of Congress because this theory maintains that the legal definition of reserves is who bears the ultimate insurance risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4652.108" offset="18711803">The term reserves, total reserves, and reserves required by law are all used in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4660.828" offset="18746702">But the statute does not define them technically.</text>
            <text syncTime="4665.392" offset="18764988">However, the cases in this Court have consistently held and this goes back to the Maryland Casualty case that these terms are deemed to have a technical meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="4676.730" offset="18810337">That is to say, a meaning consistent with that used by the state law, by the state regulatory authorities and a meaning consistent with the common and prudent business practice in the insurance industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4693.307" offset="18876583">Nonetheless, the Government argues that state law is irrelevant and the Government also says today that the state insurance regulatory authorities don’t care about these reserves as they are before the Court in the cases today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4712.440" offset="18953174">We would suggest that the state regulatory authorities who have the primary responsibility for looking for the safety of the policy holders, and therefore, looking for the solvents for the safety and importance of the solvency of these companies would not respond very favorably to the Government's comments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4735.421" offset="19045021">Now the reserve ratio test in Section 801 has been in the code for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="4740.940" offset="19067173">It was originally enacted in 1921.</text>
            <text syncTime="4743.960" offset="19079189">The present statutory definition was enacted as part of the Revenue Act of 1942 and during this long history, never has there been one suggestion in any case or in the legislative history before Congress that the test should be reserves follow the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="4764.920" offset="19163094">Another thing that is important is that the cases have always used the term funds held.</text>
            <text syncTime="4774.347" offset="19200711">And in fact the treasury’s own regulations require that funds must be held.</text>
            <text syncTime="4783.072" offset="19235610">In the present case, it is important to note that in both Treaty one and Treaty two situation, the accident and health reserves covered by these reinsurance treaties were not held by respondent and pursuant to the terms and treaties themselves and pursuant to the requirements of state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4801.068" offset="19307604">These unearned premiums did not constitute the assets of respondent on its balance sheet, and therefore, there was no requirement that it maintained the corresponding reserve.</text>
            <text syncTime="4814.243" offset="19360371">The court below placed very heavy in emphasis on the requirements of the statutory provisions of the states of Georgia and Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="4823.798" offset="19398614">In recognition, we would submit of the clear Congressional intent that state law must apply in matters relating to substantive definitions of insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="4835.431" offset="19445112">The Government’s argument in this case today ignores the requirements of the state law as interpreted by the regulatory authorities of both Georgia and Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="4848.013" offset="19495476">Court of Claims stressed the generally accepted principles that where a statute is ambiguous or doubtful and in the absence of judicial authority to the contrary, the uniform and consistent interpretation of that statute by the regulatory body charged with the responsibility of administering the statute is entitled to great weight.</text>
            <text syncTime="4871.742" offset="19590353">This principle is clearly applicable in the present case and this Court should give right weight to the fact that the state regulatory authorities of both Arizona and Georgia made no change in the reporting of the reserves of respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4892.014" offset="19671437">This was the case even after there were two tri-annual examinations during the taxable years at issue and this was the case when special attention was given to these reinsurance treaties and the reserves by the examiner from the state of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="4911.094" offset="19747715">And even after these two examinations and their special attention was given, no change was made in the reporting of the reserves by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="4920.501" offset="19785331">Therefore, we would submit that a departure from such a time honored principle as we have referred to is not warranted by the facts in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4930.866" offset="19826813">As each of these consolidated cases clearly indicate, we are swallowed up in a sea of complex terms and equally complex contractual arrangements which are perplexing to lawyers and layman alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="4947.066" offset="19891597">The depth of this complexity it seems to me demonstrates even more clearly that Congressional wisdom of leaving substantive definitions to the state regulatory authorities who have a vested interest in regulating the industry and who have a necessary training and expertise to comprehend these complex reinsurance arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4970.185" offset="19984071">Indeed --</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="4971.187" offset="19988146">Counsel could I just interrupt on one question, factual question.</text>
            <text syncTime="4974.787" offset="20002565">Does the record tell us in the Treaty two situation, who does the administration, who at the basic claim, the reinsurer or the direct insurer?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="e_michael_masinter" startTime="4984.450" stopTime="5336.987">
            <label>Mr. E. Michael Masinter</label>
            <text syncTime="4984.450" offset="20041122">Your Honor, I believe under the terms of the contract, the claim would have -- actually be paid by the direct insurer because a contract provides that to reinsurer shall reimburse the direct insurer, but other than the contract I don’t think there is any specific evidence on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5004.259" offset="20120430">I would have to go further and explain that it is common and customary in this industry for a company like American Bankers for example to assist in maintaining the books and the records because it is clear that they do have staff and the machinery and the computers and that type of thing whereas the companies like Consumer did not have the inadequate personnel to perform the record keeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="5042.360" offset="20272776">We would submit, Your Honor that these complex reinsurance arrangements are the results of highly creative people, actuaries and businessman alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="5054.317" offset="20320632">And that ones their efforts have come together to produce a complex and sophisticated reinsurance arrangements such as we have in these cases today that the federal income tax consequences should flow from the regulatory interpretation of these arrangements and not otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="5075.734" offset="20406314">We think it is very important that federal income tax consequences look to the substantive law of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="5084.007" offset="20439437">This is clearly the most efficient and effective method of imposing our federal income tax system on this industry and would permit a greater certainty in the planning of the tax and financial affairs of these companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="5100.699" offset="20506206">The Government has argued on brief that the issues and the cases dealing with the issue of substance versus form should be applicable in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5111.922" offset="20551032">The Government cannot be heard to say that these issues are applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.481" offset="20573288">These treaties cannot be disregarded for lack of economic substance or business purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5123.469" offset="20597217">The court below clearly found that these reinsurance treaties had a business purpose, but moreover and more importantly, these theory should have no application to the reinsurance transaction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5136.923" offset="20651029">Out of the multitude of cases that had dealt with the question of substance versus form before this Court and other lower Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5145.769" offset="20686451">One very clear common threat or common principle has developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5150.891" offset="20706931">A principle conceived by Judge Learned Hand in his dissent in the case of Gilbert versus Commissioner and which was followed by this Court in the Knetsch case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5160.097" offset="20743711">Judge Hand’s test was, if the taxpayer enters into a transaction that does not appreciably affect his beneficial interest except to reduce his tax, the law will disregard it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5173.743" offset="20798360">Stated conversely, this test would recognize business transactions for tax purposes if they were treated consistently for material non-tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5185.826" offset="20846634">Furthermore, we would submit that this test would have the effect of recognizing for tax purposes transactions between unrelated parties dealing in arms length except transactions which have no economic purpose apart from tax savings, as clearly was the situation in the Knetsch case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5207.876" offset="20934928">Since the transactions in the present case possessed material business motives apart from tax deferment motives, the appreciable effect test as applied to the facts in this case would compel a result that these reinsurance transactions should not be disregarded for lack of economic substance or business purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5231.757" offset="21030431">In this case, we see a factual situation where the respondent and an unrelated insurance company carefully arranged their business relationship in a sophisticated, business like manner, totally in compliance with state law and state regulatory law and totally in compliance with the income tax statute when it was permitted to qualify as a life insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="5262.531" offset="21153520">The challenge it would seem to me, if any is to be made to this reinsurance arrangement which is so common in the credit insurance industry, properly lies in the converse where statutory provisions maybe studied with care and precision and where statutes maybe written to apply in a consistent fashion to the entire industry, a result that we would submit is paramount in this complex area of a law.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.187" offset="21284133">Sophisticated business arrangements that had been in effect for many years in a particular industry as is the case here, should not be overturned on the basis of legal theories which find no support in the case law the legislative history or in fact among the regulatory bodies who have the responsibility for regulating the industry and to whom the federal taxing law looks for substantive guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="5327.788" offset="21414536">We would strongly urge this Court to affirm the decision of the Court of Claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="5333.978" offset="21439300">Thank you.</text>

          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="5341.144" stopTime="5475.750">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="5341.144" offset="21467930">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="5341.333" offset="21468662">I just have a few points to make Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5344.193" offset="21480155">Counsel for Penn Security, Mr. Jones attempted to characterize that Treaty one arrangement as one in which the company, that is the taxpayer, assumed the risk as it received these premiums on a monthly basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.264" offset="21556433">But I think if the Court examines the agreement which is set forth at page 40 A of the appendix, Article 2, simple contradicts that assertion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5374.425" offset="21601050">It says, “The liability of taxpayer on all reinsurance shall begin simultaneously with that of Pilot Life, that is the other company, and in no event shall the reinsurance of taxpayer be in force and binding unless the policy issued by Pilot Life is enforced.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5389.869" offset="21662804">I think it's plain that the very -- that the port of this agreement was that at the very beginning once the policy holder has paid the premium, Penn Security and Consumer Life in the Treaty one arrangement were on the risk and if they were on the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="5406.902" offset="21730931">They have to project that liability and they have to -- that those insurance reserves are includable in its total reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="5415.045" offset="21763532">I would think that the tax law and the insurance law is not that primitive that it cannot recognize that these contractual assumptions of risk in exchange for a receipt of premiums which are going to drop down to these taxpayers should not be attributed to it as accident and health insurance business are to be includable in the total reserves, the denominator of the statutory fraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5441.284" offset="21868544">I have one last point to make and that is with the respect to business purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="5444.884" offset="21882859">There has been a lot of talk this morning from counsel for the taxpayers that that they were business purposes to these agreements, and that they were very sophisticated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5453.586" offset="21917759">That may well be the case, but there was no insurance purpose to these Treaty two arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="5459.545" offset="21941582">The risk in the Treaty two arrangement stayed with the taxpayers and the Treaty one arrangement it was real reinsurance that was assumed by the taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5468.142" offset="21975960">That to us means that it was insurance business, accident health insurance which has to be attributed to the taxpayers.</text>
