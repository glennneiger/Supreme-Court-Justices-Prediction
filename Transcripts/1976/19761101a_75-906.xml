            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100523">We’ll hear at arguments first this morning in 75-906, Walsh v. Schlecht.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.480" offset="142423">Mr. Neil, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl R. Neil</label>
            <text syncTime="13.295" offset="153604">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.231" offset="165411">This case involves interpretation and application of Section 302 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 as amended, popularly known as Taft-Hartley Act, in the context of payments to trust required by the terms of a subcontractor’s clause in a Collective Bargaining Agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.173" offset="241166">This Court has asked to review a decision of the Supreme Court of Oregon rejecting petitioner’s defense that the subcontractor’s clause conflicts with the requirements of Section 302 (c) (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="48.746" offset="295501">The question on which petitioners sought certiorari, which was briefed, and decided among other questions by the Supreme Court of Oregon, is what are the subcontractor’s clause and requiring a signatory employer to make trust contributions on behalf of or for the benefit of employees of a non-signatory subcontractor violates the 302 (c) (5) requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.864" offset="391945">The trust agreements must benefit only employees of contributing employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.043" offset="416605">It is apparently conceded by Respondents in this Court -- I read their brief so to concede him pleasantly, that the subcontractor’s clause less construed that is to require contributions for the benefit over on behalf of subcontractor’s employees would violate Section 302 (c) (5).</text>
            <text syncTime="97.901" offset="492046">Instead, Respondent’s brief as I read it, raised three arguments, which were not made below and which now apparently are the questions to be decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.964" offset="540321">I except this, these are valid -- I don’t read a valid arguments but I think they are validly raised by the Respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.122" offset="572921">His questions are (1) they now seek to have an interpretation of Article IV of the Collective Bargaining Agreement, the subcontractor’s clause different than that made by the Court below as I read the opinion of the Court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.888" offset="620046">They say that the clause should be read to merely measure contributions to the trust by the hours of work of the non-signatory subcontractor’s employees and not to require contributions for their benefit or on their behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.937" offset="676262">That is the first argument they make.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.979" offset="684412">The second is that two of trusts, the apprenticeship trust and the vacation trust are 302 (c) (6) trust in purpose and therefore not subsidiary requirements of 302 (c) (5) concerning beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.938" offset="740210">Third, they say that one of the trusts CIAF or Construction Industry Advancement Fund trust is not 302 Trust at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.219" offset="769362">Petitioner, we submit, is entitled to prevail on all of these issues as well as on the original issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.721" offset="859328">No, as I will, if you might advantage argument, it’s a matter of Supreme Court of Oregon but I don’t think it is, I think it is a federal question, I think since Lincoln Mills of Alabama that the construction of Collective Bargaining Agreements in interstate Congress has been a matter of Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.381" offset="913976">This Court might well respect the interpretation of the Supreme Court of Oregon, but I do not think it binding on this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.035" offset="952637">The petitioner, Mr. Walsh, is a builder of multiple family housing in Portland.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.223" offset="973326">He formed a limited partnership of which he became the general partner to build and operate a 56 unit apartment project in Salem, Oregon known as Oak Hill.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.941" offset="1024213">This project was HUD supported, federally financed and therefore by agreements required by HUD the contractor and his subcontractor’s was required to adhere to the provision of the Davis-Bacon Act, principally requirement of paying prevailing wages including fringe benefits either to workmen on a job or in to trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.954" offset="1112298">The limited partnership subcontracted, the carpentry framing work to a non-union subcontractor, Lloyd Jackson.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.366" offset="1145943">Walsh, of course and it was bound by the terms of a Collective Bargaining Agreement with a carpenters union that had the subcontractor’s clause in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.927" offset="1176141">In addition to requiring Walsh to pay if he hired his own carpenters, a total of 96 cents per hour into these five trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.531" offset="1214593">The subcontractor’s clause is quoted at pages 5-6 in our brief and elsewhere in the briefs and it says in general that Walsh has a signatory agreement, shall either hire and retain only union subcontractors or if he fails to do so -- and these are the crucial words, he shall “be liable for payment of these employees, wages, travel and then it goes on the list, contributions to these five trusts”.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.191" offset="1345205">During the construction, the carpenters union find out a course that there was a non-union sub on the job and protested that Mr. Walsh who said that he was bound by the terms of the subcontract that he could not discharge the non-union subcontractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.786" offset="1399645">Mr. Walsh, the record shows, did cooperate in arranging for the non-union sub to meet with the union people and to negotiate as to whether they could be organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.444" offset="1442276">That was unsuccessful but it is agreed in the record that Mr. Walsh was cooperative in that respect.</text>

            <text syncTime="351.899" offset="1508105">He insists on his rights under this clause but I think that his evidence says that he is not unfriendly toward unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.142" offset="1544990">It is stipulated that the subcontractor paid his man directly, Jackson, a non-union subcontractor, paid his man directly, the 96 cents per hour, amounting fringe benefits, that is an amount equal to the trust contributions which would have been required if a union subcontractor had been employed.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.215" offset="1677379">No, this was paid from the outside; the subcontractor was made aware at the beginning that this was a Davis-Bacon Act job.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.570" offset="1706740">There are forms in evidence for his payroll and right on the form it says, are you paying the fringes directly your man, are you paying them to a trust?</text>
            <text syncTime="409.838" offset="1739863">He checked directly to his men and it stipulated that he did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.768" offset="1763583">The Oak Hill project was completed in November of 1971 and year later these suits were brought to seeking payment to the trust by Walsh, of the same amounts that the subcontractor had previously paid into the trust, So, we say in effect a double payment or a second payment of the same benefits or he paid to already Jackson’s men is being required from, I think principal contractor, Walsh.</text>

            <text syncTime="462.624" offset="1950933">So, when Walsh is required to pay this in order to trust that he has already paid the fixed price including the fringes once, now you have to pay them a second.</text>

            <text syncTime="2747.664" offset="11091178">That’s an important point I think because our argument is made otherwise in the brief of respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.642" offset="11111031">There is no evidence in this record of any actuarial assumptions of any of the trust funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.317" offset="11133705">Furthermore the tax on pensions and pension planning cited by respondents do not disclose that any such actuarial assumptions are made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2806.971" offset="11328370">Mr. Justice Rehnquist raised the question I think first of whether state law might control trust construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.891" offset="11356059">The Oregon Supreme Court’s opinion does not directly construe the trust agreement except by implication in its comments on Article IV and if it can be said that will construe the trust agreement, by its comments in Article IV, it construe them in our favor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.969" offset="11412379">In addition to the point made by Mr. Justice White, the Oregon Supreme Court’s opinion, I draw your attention to page 34, the appendix to our brief another portion of the Oregon Supreme Court’s opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.831" offset="11455847">In the first full paragraph where they are stating the questions as presented to the Oregon Supreme Court on this issue and they say, defendant’s first contention on cross appeal is that the subcontractor’s clause over the labor agreements violats 29 U.S.C. Section 186, that’s 302 to the extent that it maybe applied to require defendant to make contributions to union trust funds “for the benefit of employees other than his own as pleaded in defendant’s fifth affirmative defense.”</text>
