            <label>Mr. Charles Corces, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="14.309" offset="157685">Mr. Chief Justice, if it please this Honorable Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.643" offset="175030">My name is Charlie Corces, Jr. appearing in behalf of the petitioner, Wainwright in this cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.812" offset="207736">This case involves the recurring problem of the procedural default and its affect on subsequent habeas corpus proceedings in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.851" offset="263847">The court granted certiorari on two cases, on two points: 1) Whether the failure to challenge the admissibility of an out of court statement at or before trial should preclude habeas relief of a habeas petitioner’s volunteering his claim at subsequent habeas proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.326" offset="373770">And 2) Whether or not Jackson v. Denno mandates a voluntariness hearing where the admissibility of a confession is not challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.141" offset="429045">Mr. Sykes was charged in Florida with second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.244" offset="461437">He proceeded to trial and during the course of this trial certain inculpatory statements were introduced in evidence against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.968" offset="504382">Florida has a procedural rule specifically Rule 3.190 of the Florida Rules in Criminal Procedure, which require that a pre-trial motion to suppress any confessions, which is claimed or alleged were illegally obtained be made or at least that an objection be made at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.500" offset="602498">But in this case counsel for Sykes neither filed his pre-trial motion nor objected to the admissibility of any of the statements during the course of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.375" offset="661953">Mr. Sykes was convicted of murder in the third degree, a lesser offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.476" offset="694345">He appealed his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.280" offset="713571">In his appeal he did not raise the issue of the voluntariness of these admissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.163" offset="733110">The only issues he raised on appeal were the sufficiency of the evidence and two other questions pertaining to instructions as to second degree murder and instructions as to self defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.300" offset="797685">The appeal was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.273" offset="805522">The first time that Mr. Sykes raised the issue pertaining to the voluntariness of his admissions or inculpatory statements was in post conviction proceedings, filed a post conviction proceeding in the trial court in the nature of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.615" offset="886919">But in Florida a matter that was known to a criminal defendant and what should have and could have been raised at the trial level and on direct appeal cannot be raised collaterally.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.031" offset="956614">So naturally this was denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.565" offset="1042713">So here we have no question of incompetency.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.150" offset="1913113">No sir, there is no plain error apparent on the phase of this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.079" offset="1948745">As I stated out or said, Mr. Sykes subsequent to having his petitions denied in state court filed a petition in the Federal District Court for the Tampa division.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.622" offset="2010916">That court held that Mr. Sykes was not bound by his procedural default and gave Florida 90 days within which to conduct a Jackson v. Denno hearing, but on the Florida procedure it cannot be conducted so the State of Florida sought and obtained permission to appeal to the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.904" offset="2096075">The Fifth Circuit affirmed stating that it is incumbent upon a trial judge to conduct a Jackson v. Denno hearing even though an admission or an inculpatory statement is not challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.621" offset="2170994">And further that in as much as Florida had not proven, place the burden on Florida, that Florida had not proven that the procedural default was a tactical decision by Mr. Sykes that he was not bound by the procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.551" offset="2262632">We submit that both, the Federal Courts, the District Court in the Fifth Circuit were in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.478" offset="2290426">I would like to make it clearly understood to the court that we do not question the power of a Federal District Court to consider federal claims even when there has been a procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.142" offset="2365032">We are talking about the appropriate exercise of that power on the principles of comity, federalism and the appropriate administration of criminal justice where state has a procedural rule and we submit that principles of comity and federalism require that Federal Courts forego habeas relief where a petitioner has committed an inexcusable procedural default resulting in the failure to develop the historical facts contemporaneously with the timely presentation of the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.363" offset="2569936">Now, I submit that in such cases denial of relief should be the rule instead of the exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.095" offset="2624898">And I fully recognize that this may conflict somewhat with what the court said in Fay v. Noia.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.392" offset="2666067">But it conflicts with the dicta in Fay, it does not conflict with the holding in Fay because in Fay, as I understand the case, there was a timely objection at the trial level.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.456" offset="2722282">In Fay, as I understand the case, the historical facts were developed at the trial level.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.799" offset="2771706">In Fay what occurred was that the procedural default was in failing to appeal but the historical facts were developed, they were there form an appellate court to understand them and in fact if I recall in Fay, the state conceded that the confession had been coerced and in Fay in fact, there was an intentional bypass.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.218" offset="2889362">In Fay there was an intentional bypass, but this court found that it had been coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.542" offset="2918619">In other words, there was cause for failing to appeal, which brings me to what I would submit to this court are the appropriate guidelines, which have already been enunciated by this court in Davis v. The United States and that is that when there is a state procedural rule, when it is reasonable and when it has a legitimate state interest that a procedural default of that rule should preclude subsequent habeas relief where there has been a default and that default has resulted in the failure to develop the historical facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.086" offset="3140869">Unless and until such time as the habeas petitioner demonstrates not only cause, but actual prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.167" offset="3181097">I submit to the court that the Davis Guidelines are fair to both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.078" offset="3216833">They provide a criminal defendant with a federal forum so that vindication of his constitutional rights, at the same time it shows proper deference to state procedural rules, which are promulgated to give him the very constitutional rights, which he  seeks to protect and Florida has a rule, a criminal procedure rule that gives him as Jackson vs. Denno hearing, all he has to do is ask for it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1050.141" offset="4301019">If it please the court the Davis approach caused an actual prejudice as I stated is fair to both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.004" offset="4348457">It also requires a criminal defendant, it forces a criminal defendant to make his constitutional assertions timely so the state can focus on the particular issue and this case points out exactly what I am talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.592" offset="4430795">Whether or not, he was so intoxicated that he could not understand his Miranda Warnings, if the state is not put on notice to this issue, they cannot focus their evidence on the issue unless they put on notice as to this issue and unless he is forced to make his claim in a timely manner, then the state is forced to contest this issue maybe years later when he raises it in Federal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.403" offset="4570080">It also, if it pleased the court, it tends to simplify federal habeas proceedings because by forcing a criminal defendant to take advantage of a state procedural rule, which would develop the historical facts it would make federal habeas proceedings a lot easier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.787" offset="4659628">All that they would need, Federal District Courts would need is a transcript of what occurred in state court to determine the constitutional issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.993" offset="4732457">I would submit to this court that in this case the respondent Sykes has demonstrated neither cause nor prejudice and that the decisions of the lower courts were in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.860" offset="4799958">Now, as to point two Jackson v. Denno, the Fifth Circuit held that Jackson v. Denno mandates a voluntariness hearing even in the absence of a challenge to the confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.860" offset="4887938">I find it to be a curious ruling by the Fifth Circuit because in 1972 the rule completely otherwise in a very similar case to this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1207.687" offset="4931197">That one involved a federal prisoner and they ruled that Jackson v. Denno did not mandate a voluntariness hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.310" offset="4973724">In Randall v. State cited in the brief of petition, the Fifth Circuit relies on this court’s decision in Sims v. Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.790" offset="5019595">But in Sims v. Georgia there was a specific motion to suppress filed by the defendant seeking to suppress his confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.792" offset="5079677">Whether or not this court has specifically ruled on this point I do not believe it has.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.619" offset="5102978">However, I have noticed that in all the opinions that have been written they carefully stake challenged confessions as recently as Michigan v. Moseley and as recently as Brewer v. Williams the confession was challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.712" offset="5207363">To require a trial court on its own initiative, to conduct a Jackson v. Denno hearing is then require the trial judge to interfere with the defense of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.031" offset="5264624">There maybe many reasons why even the defense would want an inculpatory statement in evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.270" offset="5297538">It may contain defensive matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.270" offset="5309554">“Yes, I killed him but in self defense”, he may not want to take the witness stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.638" offset="5342991">To establish self defense in his confession may establish it for him, it may contain matters pertaining to insanity, which he would rather not take the witness stand and rely on the confession that comes in to evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1400.400" offset="5702122">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.255" offset="5713512">The ultimate issue presented by this case is whether a defendant who was failed to comply with a state procedural rule which gives him a full and fair opportunity to raise a claim that his confession was obtained without compliance with this court’s holding in Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.475" offset="5770354">They simply march into a Federal Court at his pleasure and obtained habeas corpus relief in a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.929" offset="5796163">I think it would be helpful before detailing our position on this issue to speak to the facts of this case in a little bit more detail and there were two points I wanted to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.238" offset="5833466">First, there is this inconsistency between the order of the Court of Appeals in this case and the order of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.640" offset="5859066">The District Court remanded this case for Florida to hold a full blown hearing on the issue of voluntariness of the confession, what described as Jackson v. Denno hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.074" offset="5900758">The Court of Appeals in affirming said that the State of Florida need only provide a hearing going to the issue of whether Miranda had been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.454" offset="5938269">There is some confusion in the Court of Appeals’ opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.032" offset="5948614">The Court of Appeals’ opinion seem to suggest that had the trial court initially on its own ordered a Jackson v. Denno hearing then counsel’s attention might have been more specifically drawn to this issue and he might have raised the claim on his own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.571" offset="6018727">In light of this, I think it is important to take a brief look at what happened at the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.728" offset="6039416">The evidence was fairly simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.614" offset="6046939">Willie Gilbert was shot to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.464" offset="6058328">I think it was on January 8, 1972, within minutes after the crime was committed the police arrived at the defendant’s home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1499.377" offset="6098034">Willie Gilbert was laying about 10 feet from the door of the defendant’s house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.360" offset="6113917">The defendant’s wife came running up to the police and she said John shot Willie.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.251" offset="6133456">A few minutes later the defendant walked up to the police and he said “I shot Willie.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.150" offset="6153100">They placed him under arrest and he was then taken into the police station and interrogated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.260" offset="6177551">At the trial, the issue of Miranda was quite evident the defense lawyers specifically on cross examination of the police officer listed the exact warnings that were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.519" offset="6230527">He asked whether the defendant was intoxicated at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.026" offset="6252575">He did everything except make a formal motion to suppress the evidence on the grounds that Miranda had not been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.135" offset="6280996">Now, they may very well have been reason for this on the record in this case because if you read the transcript, if you just read the states case alone, without consideration of the confession there is an overwhelming case at least on the charge for which the defendant was convicted which is a kind of manslaughter charge which in Florida is denominated as murder on the third degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.254" offset="6365528">The state did not need his confession on its Case in Chief prove his guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.442" offset="6390292">The confession became relevant only in light of his defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.520" offset="6406593">That is the defendant was required in this case and the defendant’s lawyer knew it, and everybody else knew it that to take the stand and make out a case based on self defense and that is were his confession, his incriminatory statement became particularly pertinent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.062" offset="6468764">Now, since there was no claim that this confession was involuntary in the traditional sense and there is nothing in the record of the trial to indicate that this confession was involuntary in the traditional sense, presumably counsel may have been aware that once the defendant took the stand in this case that statement whether Miranda was complied with or not could have been used to impeach the credibility of his self defense testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.959" offset="6576284">And there may very well have been counsel may very well have felt that what is the point of making an objection on the state’s direct case, when the evidence is going to come in anyway, when I put my client on the stand and he is impeached by his prior confession.</text>

            <text syncTime="1665.490" offset="6762485">I think in the context of what happened here and the manner in which this confession could have been used and in which counsel may have anticipated it could have been used, he simply may have felt that it would be pointless to raise an objection on the direct case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.236" offset="6829463">And as in this context that I think we have to look at the issue of whether he can now come in to a Federal Court and obtain habeas corpus relief without ever having complied with a reasonable state procedural rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="2205.744" offset="8923438">In that context we would think that if there was no other evidence, except the coerced confession, which was the case in Fay v. Noia.</text>

            <text syncTime="2242.521" offset="9070560">If you will recall in Johnson v. New Jersey the court said that Miranda would be applied retroactively to all trials which took place after the date of its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.693" offset="9107236">In Jenkins v. Delaware, the court said well that did not apply to retrials where the conviction had been reversed after Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.150" offset="9137120">And the defendant was scheduled to be tried again and the reasons that the court gave are really the basic reasons why we believe that habeas corpus should be denied in this particular context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.244" offset="9181424">And that is the court said that when the trial had not yet commenced, it was relatively close in point of time to the date that the crime was committed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.452" offset="9222279">That law enforcement officers could attempt to reconstruct their case while memories were still fresh.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.842" offset="9243804">But when you were dealing with a conviction that was reversed probably years have gone by, much more difficult to reconstruct the case particularly where the prosecutor had relied on the confession as an essential part of this case, so that the court said for these reasons, even though Miranda applies to trials that took place after the date of the holding, we are not going to apply it to retrials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.458" offset="9338263">And those same underlying considerations of policy apply equally here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.542" offset="9354668">But the court said, the defendant can still take advantage perhaps of the rule that if they could show that his confession was truly involuntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.613" offset="9386955">As a matter of fact, then maybe he can get relief and that is the basic analysis here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.533" offset="9418616">So that I think that it is quite clear that the both the District Court and the Court of Appeals erred in granting habeas corpus relief in the context of the case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.775" offset="9471592">I wonder Mr. Chief Justice if I could reserve my remaining time for some rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2424.369" offset="9797913">Now, this rule says upon motion, it is in my brief, both the federal rule and the state rule are side by side at page 2 and there is a state rule and on page 3 is the federal rule and they are totally inconsistent with one another and totally distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.385" offset="9906060">The Florida rule says upon the motion of the defendant, and then it says, and is disjunctive.</text>
