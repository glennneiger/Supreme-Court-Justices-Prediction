            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100575">We will hear arguments next in 75-1262, United States against City of Fresno.</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="46.772" offset="287612">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.655" offset="303181">These cases are here on direct appeal by the United States and individual Forest Service Employees, from two decisions of the California Court of Appeals for the Fifth district.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.721" offset="355426">The sole question is whether a California Tax on possessory interests in improvements on tax-exempt land may constitutionally be applied to the occupancy of government owned housing by employees of the United States Forest Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.611" offset="434942">The amounts involved in these tax assessments are relatively small.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.945" offset="456258">The principal could be quite far reaching in view of the extensive amount of housing which is supplied by the United States to employees not only of the forest service but also of various branches of the Department of Interior and most importantly of the Military.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="106.488" offset="526475">Let me put this to the outset Mr. Shapiro.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.785" offset="543612">Suppose California and perhaps it does, but I am not aware of it, had a provision in an State Income Tax Law or a regulation that provided that whenever an employed person receives housing as part of his or her work, the reasonable value of that housing would be added to the net taxable income of the person portion of California income tax purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.938" offset="676314">Would that be a different situation constitutionally from what we have here.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="149.995" offset="700555">Yes, it would Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.335" offset="705884">In these cases the housing is not supplied free of charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.197" offset="725319">The employee occupies the housing although as a tenant at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.812" offset="759801">He pays compensation for it which is deducted from his salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.231" offset="773489">Now he does not pay in advance for the housing, he pays for the housing he has occupied each two week period.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.497" offset="798462">So this is not in any sense compensation to the employee.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="180.310" stopTime="187.020">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="180.310" offset="821764">Mr. Shapiro could Congress declare this interest immune from taxation, could Congress do it, what do you think?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="howard_e_shapiro" startTime="187.020" stopTime="209.949">
            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="187.020" offset="848617">We believe that Congress could.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.852" offset="855932">It has not done so, because of the tax as we view it falls directly on in an incident of the employment of a federal employee, and hence a tax on the federal function itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.650" offset="915073">The constitution therefore bars the imposition of the tax under the doctrine of M'Culloch v. Maryland.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="209.949" stopTime="217.457">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="209.949" offset="940359">Do you think the constitution bars it to the extent that Congress could not permit California to tax it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="howard_e_shapiro" startTime="217.457" stopTime="244.547">
            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="217.457" offset="970348">I believe Congress can wave the immunity of M'Culloch v. Maryland, and I think it has, in some instances done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.866" offset="1003994">For example, with respect to national banks, there is some limited taxation of national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.839" offset="1031893">On the other hand, that statute which permits national bank taxation is quite limited as this court held in the first agricultural credit a few terms back.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="244.547" stopTime="251.091">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="244.547" offset="1078704">So it is not the same kind of prohibitions, as one would find in the First Amendment, for example.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="howard_e_shapiro" startTime="251.091" stopTime="311.878">
            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="251.091" offset="1104931">No, it is within the reach of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.759" offset="1111514">But, Congress has given us some indication that it does not intend generally to wave the immunity of instrumentalities of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.986" offset="1148503">In a somewhat analogous area, the Buck Act of 1942 subjects or rather provides that certain state sales and use taxes maybe imposed in exclusive federal enclaves.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.042" offset="1236693">And the exclusivity of those federal enclaves is not bar to the imposition of that kind of a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.634" offset="1255083">However, the same statute in Section 107 says, “This statute does not consent to the imposition of state taxes on instrumentalities of the United States or the property of the United States”.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.460" offset="1306387">And it is really that which is our position here, that here we are dealing with a tax on a federal function.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="336.109" offset="1444941">But isn’t it true?</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="337.672" offset="1451210">No, that is what this states have contended.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.569" offset="1466779">Now our answer to that, now that is what the counties have contended, our answer to that is the possessory interest of the employee on the residential side cannot be in fact separated from the governmental use of this property and this is reflected we think in the findings of the trial court which reviewed the assessments involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.802" offset="1567716">The two trial courts here in Fresno County and in Tuolumne County, found that because of the inter-relationship between the residential and governmental aspects of the employees use and occupancy of this property, they had no possessory interest within the meaning of California law.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.753" offset="1647546">Now the fact that the Court Of Appeals in this case, reversed that as a matter of California law but of course we are dealing with the impact on a federal interest of the state tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.855" offset="1695925">And so the question of what that impact is, is not determined by the State Court’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.180" offset="1725287">This is a question of federal law that has to be resolved.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="415.686" offset="1763217">This is not really a very historical determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.747" offset="1775546">The real basis for the imposition of this tax was a California court decision in 1967, Caldwell &amp; Klein against the camp (ph).</text>

            <text syncTime="1698.490" offset="6894502">There was a question as to whether or not an employee who resided in a private home or who rented a private home outside of the forest would pay tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.725" offset="6935462">And the answer to that is you would pay tax but not directly.</text>

            <text syncTime="1719.951" offset="6980288">The tax is assessed to the owner of the real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.561" offset="6994812">And as a part of that income, the tax that the lessor would pay, would be included in the rental amount and I think that is the answer to that.</text>
