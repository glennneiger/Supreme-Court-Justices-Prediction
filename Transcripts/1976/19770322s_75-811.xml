            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100527">In Swain against Pressley, the respondent is in custody pursuant to a sentence imposed by the superior court of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.138" offset="141069">He has filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus in United States District Court for the District of Columbia asking that Court to review the constitutionality of the proceedings that led to his conviction and sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.123" offset="193000">The question presented by this case is whether ยง110(g) of the District of Columbia Code prevents the District Court from entertaining the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.249" offset="233438">The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that the District Court should entertain the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.855" offset="255903">We anonymously reversed because we find that the statutory language plainly bars the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.702" offset="283280">The reasons for our decision are set forth in an opinion which contains two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.693" offset="303237">All the members of the Court have joined part one of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.390" offset="318075">The Chief Justice has filed a concurring opinion which is joined by Mr. Justice Blackmun and Mr. Justice Rehnquist which does not join the second part of the Court's opinion but does join the judgment.</text>
