            <label>Mr. Bernard D. Gaffney</label>
            <text syncTime="67.360" offset="372799">Mr. Chief Justice and may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.117" offset="387845">My name is Bernard Gaffney and I am an assistant in the office of the State’s Attorney in Hartford, Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.633" offset="421909">I might say that in addition to representing the petitioner in this appeal, I represented the State in the trial of the case in the Superior Court in Hartford and I have also represented the State in the various judicial proceedings which have followed in both the State and the Federal Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.861" offset="510830">This case arose from an undercover narcotics investigation in Hartford factually on the evening of May 5, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.272" offset="552417">An undercover State Police Officer, Jimmy Glover and an informant went to the third floor of an apartment building on Westland Street in Hartford for the expressed purpose of purchasing narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.126" offset="631829">Now there are some questions as to whether Glover and the informant went to the specific apartment unit on the third floor that they had intended to go to and there is no question that when they got there, the transaction was with some other person than had been intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.426" offset="725034">However, there is no question that Officer Glover in exchange for $20 purchased two glassine envelopes containing heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.963" offset="783235">In court, Glover made a positive identification of the respondent, known Brathwaite, as the seller of the narcotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.624" offset="841853">Now if may I just go on, the sale took place at the doorway to the apartment and the testimony was that the total transaction, that is from its very start to its conclusion, took some where between five and seven minutes, and during this total period, the door to the apartment remained open for a period of about three minutes and the seller was standing in the doorway.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.045" offset="975600">And Glover said that during this 3-minute period, he stood within 2 feet of his seller and was looking directly at his face, and he went on to say that he had absolutely no trouble in seeing in the hallway.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.217" offset="1060237">It was the time?</text>

            <label>Mr. Bernard D. Gaffney</label>
            <text syncTime="241.527" offset="1069432">The transaction Your Honor took place at approximately or began at approximately 7:45 PM.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="253.877" stopTime="255.081">
            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="253.877" offset="1118856">On what date?</text>

          <turn speaker="bernard_d_gaffney" startTime="255.081" stopTime="400.420">
            <label>Mr. Bernard D. Gaffney</label>
            <text syncTime="255.081" offset="1123662">May 5, 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.028" offset="1131499">Now Judge Friendly, in his opinion, the Second Circuit Court opinion, pointed out that sunset on that day had occurred 7:53 PM.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.464" offset="1189177">Now outside the building at the conclusion of the transaction, Glover gave a description of his seller to Officer Michael D’Onofrio of the Hartford Police Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.997" offset="1235362">D’Onofrio was stationed outside the building as a Covering Officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.130" offset="1259917">Now D’Onofrio knew Brathwaite by sight.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.088" offset="1275695">He had seen him on a number of occasions prior to the date of the sale and he recognized the description, which Glover gave as applying to Brathwaite.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.990" offset="1331284">Now that night or the following date, D’Onofrio obtained a photograph of Brathwaite from the files of the Hartford Police Department and he took that photograph over to State Police Headquarters and he left it on Glover’s desk.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.483" offset="1397321">And I might point out parenthetically that the office of the State Police Headquarters in Hartford and the City of Hartford Police Headquarters are in two different buildings, geographically separated from one another by some distance.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.939" offset="1475166">Now a day or two later, specifically on May 7th, Glover returned to his office and he found the photo which D’Onofrio had left on his desk and he positively identified the person shown in the photograph as the same person from whom he had purchased the narcotics.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.165" offset="1563982">And I think it’s worth mentioning that at the time he did that, that at the time Glover viewed the photo, D’Onofrio was not present, and as a matter of fact, there is no evidence that there was any contact between D’Onofrio and Glover, between the date of the sale and the date of the photographic viewing, and no evidence, whatsoever, of any verbal influence or pressure brought by D’Onofrio upon Glover to make an identification.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thurgood_marshall" startTime="400.420" stopTime="402.154">
            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="400.420" offset="1705044">Except a picture.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_d_gaffney" startTime="402.154" stopTime="734.563">
            <label>Mr. Bernard D. Gaffney</label>
            <text syncTime="402.154" offset="1711940">Yes, Your Honor, except the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.907" offset="1726986">Now after it was confirmed by analysis that the substance sold was, in fact, heroin, police arrested Brathwaite.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.895" offset="1770977">It’s more than a little significance, I would submit, that Brathwaite’s arrest occurred at the very same apartment from which the sale had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.523" offset="1825416">That was not Brathwaite’s home, he lived at another address on Albany Avenue in Hartford and the Westland Street address was occupied by a Mrs. Ramsey.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.002" offset="1871391">Now Brathwaite said on cross-examination that he had visited that apartment on Westland Street many times prior to the date of the offense and that Mrs. Ramsey who occupied that apartment was a friend of the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.250" offset="1948400">Now during the trial, through Officer Glover, the State offered testimonial evidence of the photographic identification and the photo itself, and Officer Glover made a positive in-court identification of Brathwaite.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.307" offset="2032619">Now the principal issue before this Court, as I understand it, is whether the case of Stovall and Denno, which this Court decided in June 1967, established a strict exclusionary rules, such that the admission of evidence of a pretrial identification, an unnecessary and suggestive pretrial identification, renders a criminal accuse, conviction and violation of due process standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.206" offset="2164172">That is what the Federal Appeals Court said in reversing the decision of the United States District Court that Stovall did establish such a rule and that the rule was violated by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.339" offset="2220701">Now the petitioner has conceded that the procedure which the police used was suggestive and that it did consist of one photo show up, and we’ve also considered that the procedure used by the police was unnecessary, because there really was no emergency that existed and no exigent circumstances that would have prohibited the police from restoring to some more reliable technique.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.723" offset="2362284">We dispute the fact, however, that the suggestiveness was in anyway pronounced or aggravated or even remotely like that, which existed in the Foster case, Foster and California, which was decided after Stovall, I believe, in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.557" offset="2429576">And I emphasize in making that point that it detective D’Onofrio knew Brathwaite by sight, that he had seen him on a number of prior occasions, and that he recognized the description which Glover gave him.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.307" offset="2492583">And I also stress that D’Onofrio was not present when Glover made his identification from the photograph and exerted no verbal influence upon him.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.637" offset="2549948">What we are saying is that although the pretrial photo identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive, there was no great likelihood of any misidentification under all of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.881" offset="2622882">Now with respect to the issue before Your Honors, the existence or nonexistence of a strict rule of exclusion, nowhere in the language of Mr. Justice Brennan’s opinion in the Stovall case, and I am referring to Part 2 of that opinion, nowhere did the words ‘exclusionary rule’ or ‘strict exclusionary rule’ appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.619" offset="2725804">What the Court said on Page 302 of that opinion is that, “A claimed violation of due process of law or the conduct of a confrontation depends on the totality of the circumstances which surrounded.”</text>
            <text syncTime="672.351" offset="2792782">And the same overriding principle was restated about a year after Stovall, in the Simmons case recorded in 390 U.S. and in that case, Mr. Justice Harlan said, “We hold that each case must be considered on its own facts”, and he went on later in the opinion to say that convictions will be set aside, only if the procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.676" offset="2934053">Now in April of 1969, the Foster case to which I have alluded, Foster against California, adopted the same language residing that identification procedure should be judged “in the totality of the circumstances”, and Your Honors I am sure will recall that in that case there were repeated procedures used by the police which the Court said violated due process, and that conviction, I believe, was reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="754.701" offset="3122134">Coleman and Alabama, I know, was decided after Foster in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.583" offset="3141674">Again, similar language, ‘totality of the surrounding circumstances’ has been the key to evaluating or assessing the prejudicial effect of a pretrial line up in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.826" offset="3202696">Now more recently, of course, in the case of Neil and Biggers, decided in December of 1972, this Court said in rather specific language that it’s the reliability of the evidence under all of the circumstances, which is the central question.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.560" offset="3281586">So that its overall reliability, which is paramount, as I read the case, even though the identification procedure may have been suggestive.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.257" offset="3324426">That is the precision which the petitioner takes in this appeal that the admission of the show up without more, and the language used by Justice Powell, does not violate due process and that each case should be decided on its own facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.356" offset="3396838">Now I submit to Your Honors that if the Biggers criteria, those annunciated by Mr. Justice Powell in that case, are applied to the instant case that Glover’s identification is wholly reliable.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.425" offset="3465070">And the reasons for that contention, I have tried to set forth beginning on Page 12 of the petitioner’s brief, the opportunity to view the suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.527" offset="3513448">Glover was at very close quarters, at the doorway to the apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.175" offset="3532048">He was looking directly at his subject and the door was open during that period for up to three minutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="962.528" offset="3953455">The two or three minute observation; is it your view that the conversation took two or three minutes or that there was a very brief conversation?</text>
            <text syncTime="969.306" offset="3980622">They stood for another two minutes looking at one other silently.</text>

            <text syncTime="972.497" offset="3993370">Well, I think more like the latter, Your Honor, because for the reason, as I have tried to indicate that the seller wanted to be sure that he could deal with the parties in front of him, that he wasn’t being set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.416" offset="4041017">And the conversation would not necessarily have had any bearing on that, but I think that the two or three minutes took place initially and that the period of time, after the door opened the second time, was much briefer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.483" offset="4117295">Insofar as the degree of attention, as I have indicated, Officer Glover was a trained officer, trained Police Officer, and, of course, he was on a potentially dangerous assignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.002" offset="4167346">I think you can feel sure, at least I felt sure, that he was careful in viewing his subject.</text>

            <text syncTime="1030.021" offset="4223457">Given the level of certainty, Officer Glover was unequivocal in his identification in-court and the length of time between the crime, the date of the crime, and the confrontation was relatively brief, a-day-and-a-half, perhaps two days at the very most.</text>

            <text syncTime="1135.070" offset="4643610">Well, [Laughter] the delay, insofar as the confrontation occurred and Glover’s not getting back to his office until May 7, that is May 5 to May 7; as far as the arrest is concerned that would not, under the procedures used in Hartford, that would not have occurred until after it was confirmed by analysis, toxicological analysis, that the substance purchased was, in fact, narcotic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.943" offset="4763146">Now that did not happen, Mr. Justice Marshall, until some time in July, and I concede that that is a rather extended delay and all that I can tell you is that it relates to the backlog, the work-log of the State Laboratory in Hartford.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.240" offset="4832319">After it was confirmed, as I recall it, Brathwaite’s arrest took place, not too long thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.118" offset="4875891">Now the rationale, of course, or the reasoning for the strict exclusionary rule as Justice Powell wrote, is to deter the police from using a less reliable procedure when a more reliable one would be available to them, to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.100" offset="4939734">The Court said that the rule would not be premised on the assumption that the admission of the evidence of such a confrontation offends due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.099" offset="4983724">Now if that’s the case, it would seem to me that in the first instance the question is whether such a strict rule is going to have any real deterrent effect on the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.357" offset="5028760">Now Justice Blackmun discussed that issue in a recent case decided this past July, U.S. against Janis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.927" offset="5067107">I think that was a Fourth Amendment case, but based on the Court’s discussion in the Janis case, it would seem that there is more than a little doubt that, in fact, such a rule, an exclusionary rule, has a deterrent effect, at least some doubt among the analysts or the statisticians or those who have perhaps looked into it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.479" offset="5165328">But assuming that it does, assuming that it will have a deterrent effect, I suggest to Your Honors that what is important is that there is no compelling need today for such a strict rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.041" offset="5223528">Now my experience, I can see it is limited to Connecticut and more specifically, Hartford in the areas that surround Hartford, but I have been exposed over the years to a great, great many cases and I submit to Your Honors that the abuses today are minimum, whether the police are learning or what the reason is, I am really not prepared to say, but I can say this that in my experience photo show-ups and highly suggestive procedures are the exception today and not the rule; that in the great majority of cases where photo show-ups, for example, are used, they are used by the police because of circumstances which maybe peculiar to the case or to confirm the identity of a person who is already known.</text>

            <text syncTime="1343.129" offset="5475871">That’s important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.657" offset="5489977">If the basic purpose of a trial is the determination of the truth, and Mr Justice Stewart said that in the Teahn and Shott case decided in 382 U.S. at 416 and I suppose that’s really axiomatic, but I certainly subscribe to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.707" offset="5566151">If you accept that, I submit that the prosecution then should not be prohibited in all cases from introducing this type of evidence, because the effect of the rule will then be to keep out what in most cases is really relevant evidence and in many cases, certainly prohibitive evidence and perhaps valid evidence as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.015" offset="5663431">Now Mr. Justice Blackmun said Jurists and Scholars uniformly have recognized that the exclusionary rule imposes a substantial cost and suicidal interest in law enforcement by its proscription of what concededly is relevant evidence, that in the Janis case to which I just referred and I guess that’s really the point I am trying to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.165" offset="5771995">Something will be lost in many of the trials if such a rule is adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.476" offset="5793311">And as an aside and as a practical matter from one who is a prosecutor in cases, such as this one where you have a one witness identification, Glover being the sole identifying witness, the evidence is going to come in to the case anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.259" offset="5872410">The defense in its cross-examination of the state’s chief identifying witness, undoubtedly, in most cases at least is going to offer the evidence for the purpose of undermining the chief identification witness for the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1459.917" offset="5943045">Now I submit that if that occurs, the state, in many cases, is going to be placed in a bad light.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.198" offset="5980139">Jury simply are not going to understand that the State, because of the inadmissibility of the evidence, wasn’t permitted to offer it in the first instance and having failed to present it, I submit again, the State just is not going to look good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.064" offset="6051610">Juries want to hear all of the evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1552.803" offset="6314611">Now if there is no such rule and the evidence, at least in some cases, is offered by the prosecution, I submit that certainly the trial judge, in an appropriate instruction, can advise the jury of the weaknesses and the dangers and the deficiencies of such suggestive pretrial procedures by the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.809" offset="6414608">In summary, it’s the position of the petitioner that Stovall and the cases that have been decided since Stovall did not establish a strict exclusionary rule that due process standards do not require and that there is no compelling need for the adoption of such a rule today, particularly if the objective is the deterrent effect on the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.956" offset="6519202">And that the key question is really one of reliability, reliability of the identification of evidence under all of the circumstances and whether or not withstanding some suggestive pretrial procedure, whether there is really any great substantial likelihood of the reparable misidentification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.858" offset="6598823">In short, that the cases should be decided on a case-by-case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.786" offset="6622542">Now -- and what I have referred to in the Petitioners’ brief as a contingency opinion, Judge Friendly said that even if there was no exclusionary rule, even if it was wrong in that conclusion, the respondent should be given a new trial, and for other reasons -- and I concede that he had a right, the Appeals Court had a right, to examine the record and interpret the legal significance of all of the facts in the context of due process, but when the Court decided that Officer Glover was not a reliable witness, not a credible witness, because he was a Police Officer whose job was to make arrest; that an ordinary citizen or a bi-standard would be more credible witness; that Glover’s positive in-court identification of Braithwaite wasn’t worthy of belief because Braithwaite was the only person sitting at the counsel table and that he must have made dozens of other arrests between the time of the offense and the time of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.147" offset="6871960">I submit that in that connection the Appeals Court was injecting its own viewpoints, its own personal convictions and those were peculiarly, I would think, within the provenance of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.225" offset="6928280">Justice Frankfurter in Malinski case, 324 U.S. at page 417, expressed it well far better than I have, when he said the judicial judgment in applying the Due Process Clause was moved within the limits of accepted notions of justice, and it is not to be based upon the idiosyncrasies of merely personal judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.624" offset="7013857">An important safeguard against such merely individual judgment is an alert deference to the judgment of the State Court under review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1967.327" offset="7972655">There is certainly as actual prejudice to the defendants in the case shown here under Francis versus Henderson.</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.786" offset="11962493">With respect to whether or not a strict rule of exclusion is wanted in this case, we have argued in the brief that there is a constitutional basis for the rule, and I think we are also aware that several members of this Court have indicated that there is some doubt in their minds about whether a constitutional basis either in the Fifth Amendment right to a fair trial exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.016" offset="12055385">We feel, we don’t retreat from the position we took in the brief, as to the fact that the identification law cases Gilbert and Stovall, indicate that there is a right to -- that the right to a fair trial would apply and warrant a deterrent exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.559" offset="12105644">But we feel, in addition, that the recent decisions of this Court, dealing with the development of the standards under which a deterrent rule is warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.728" offset="12138245">I am talking about decisions such as Michigan versus Tucker, Calandra, Brown versus Illinois, and cases such as those indicate that there are certain guidelines that this Court feels are applicable when creation of deterrent rule is considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.468" offset="12201253">And in Michigan versus Tucker, the Court indicated that even when there is no constitutional basis for the rule, that a deterrent rule can be warranted for prophylactic rules designed to ensure constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.097" offset="12251721">Of course, in Michigan versus Tucker, it was the Miranda rule that was -- the fruits of the Miranda rule that were an issue, but the point in Michigan versus Tucker and the point in all of these cases, is the Court has been formulating standards by which a deterrent rule can be warranted, and we feel that under the standards announced in those cases, that the strict rule of exclusion suggested and adopted by the Second Circuit is fully amended.</text>

            <text syncTime="3111.675" offset="12550040">As I was saying before the lunch recess, I think that if we look to the cases of this Court in recent terms, dealing with development of exclusionary rules for deterrent purposes, they provide guidelines which can be applied to this case and which mandate creation of the rule that the Second Circuit adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.884" offset="12618898">As I mentioned before, this rule, the strict rule of exclusion of unnecessarily suggestive identification evidence deals only with evidence that can and should be deterred; because the procedure was unnecessary, it is either willful and negligent, it falls within the definitions of all the cases that deal with the development of these rules, as conduct that is, of which the officers have knowledge is improper or are properly chargeable with knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.281" offset="12732479">Second of all, I think it’s clear that this is a rule that will have impact, it’s a rule that will aim directly at the conduct of the officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.165" offset="12764035">They will understand under what circumstances their conduct was permissible, under what circumstances their conduct was not permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.017" offset="12787440">It avoids the second step of the analysis which gets into the particular individual, who made the identification, the witness involved, the officer may not offend and under present law, understand that it’s that -- it’s the witness’s length of observation or the witness’s memory that makes an identification survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.993" offset="12867375">Under the strict rule of exclusion, impact on the officers will be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.278" offset="12880436">If they use a suggestive means, they will understand that that means, is why the -- is result of that procedure that the evidence was excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.629" offset="12917844">Thirdly, it’s also clear that there really is no other remedy right now for the victim of this kind of procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.578" offset="12953684">If there is no constitutional basis for the procedure, if there is no constitutional violation that occurs when a photographic show-up is employed, certainly there is no remedy under any kind of civil rights action or any kind of tort theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.894" offset="13006973">This Court has held only recently that the prosecutors are immune from suit, for something like this I would think, it would clearly fall under the recent decision.</text>
