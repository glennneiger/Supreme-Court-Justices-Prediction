            <text syncTime="13.971" offset="159222">Mr. Frankel you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Carl B. Frankel</label>
            <text syncTime="19.579" offset="181687">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.870" offset="198823">Beginning in 1964 and at each of he biannual convention since then, the membership of the United Steelworkers of America has voted to adopt in its present form a meeting attendance requirement, applicable by constitution to all of the 5200 Local Unions which comprise the Steelworkers International.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.126" offset="303835">Under that rule to be eligible for a Local Union office in any of the 5200 Local Unions, a member must have attended one half of the regular monthly meetings in the three-year period preceding the election, the three-year period being the term, a prior term of office unless his work or Union activities prevent attendance.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.038" offset="407489">This case arises under the Section 401 (e) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, 29 U.S.C. Section 481 (e) which provide for the right of the member to run for Local Union office and provides that that right to subject to reasonable qualifications uniformly imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.201" offset="500172">This case began when one of two defeated candidates for president of Local 3489 and its 1970 election of officers challenged the validity of the meeting attendance requirement first internally within the Union and then in the complaint filed with the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.755" offset="578435">The Secretary within the time awarded by statute then filed this law suit, attacking the meeting attendance rule as applied in the 1970 election of Local 3486.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.936" offset="627127">The District Court following the lead of the Sixth Circuit and four other District Courts, which all of whom had passed on the validity of the Steelworkers meeting attendance rule, held that our rule was indeed a reasonable qualification under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.592" offset="689716">The Secretary appealed to the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.049" offset="699538">The Seventh Circuit departing from this line of authority, concluded on the contrary that the rule was unreasonable and the conflict between the Seventh Circuit and the Sixth Circuit is what brings this case to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.098" offset="775816">Well Your Honors, actually the issue in this case is a very, very narrow one, much narrower than I had initially thought.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.443" offset="805177">Upon reading briefs, one gets to appreciate just how narrow it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.709" offset="826180">I want to emphasize out by starting with where we and the Secretary of Labor agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.521" offset="853452">The Secretary of Labor and the Steelworkers agree even under the Secretary's most recent regulation that it is reasonable under the Statute for Unions to have meeting attendance rules, point number one where we agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.018" offset="919489">The second point to which we agree is that such rules serve valid Union purposes and now I am quoting the Secretary, namely to ensure that candidates have demonstrated interest in and familiarity with the affairs of the organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="3454.174" offset="13920110">The justifications that have been advanced by the Steelworkers for the rule are basically three; encouragement of attendance of meeting, assurance with the office holders having interest in union affairs, and assurance of capable union leadership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.352" offset="13984789">While the Secretary does not believe that meeting attendance rules are not responsive to any bona fide union objectives, he does not believe that this meeting attendance rule is sufficiently related to those objectives to justify the burdens and the effects of the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.547" offset="14057514">There is no showing here for example, that a two-year, 50 % meeting attendance rule would not have been as efficacious in serving the goals that the Steelworkers say they are attempting to serve here as does their three-year 50 % --</text>
