            <text syncTime="64.045" offset="356640">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.764" offset="375553">My name is Herbert F. Moore and the appellants that we represent are two municipal corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.078" offset="412752">The name of the City is Philadelphia and Glen Cove Long Island, three rather large solid waste disposers located in the State of New Jersey, and one very large solid waste collector, also operating out of the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.386" offset="485999">The purpose of our being here, of course, is to test the constitutionality against the Commerce Clause of a statute enacted in New Jersey, which is entitled an act to prohibit any person from bringing into the state any solid and liquid waste, which originated or was collected outside of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.043" offset="576696">I feel compelled to explain, before I proceed into the legal arguments, some peculiarities of the present posture of the case that lands at a certain uniqueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.341" offset="625806">That is that we started this out in the Superior Court Law Division in New Jersey with the complaint that had, I think close to 20 counts, all of which were constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.601" offset="674916">But in the interest of efficiency and I am keeping a court clawed under reasonably unclawed, we proceeded through the summary judgment procedure on an issue which did not contain any disputed facts of material significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.846" offset="743880">It was on that basis that Judge Schad (ph) ruled in our favor that the statute was unconstitutional on the grounds that are discriminated against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.522" offset="782541">And, it was on that basis that the appeal was taken by the State of New Jersey to the Appellant Division.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="175.544" offset="802707">Under his view what was the commerce, the substance or the service?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="herbert_f_moore" startTime="181.095" stopTime="242.980">
            <label>Mr. Herbert F. Moore</label>
            <text syncTime="181.095" offset="824859">I believe, Your Honor, it was both the substance and the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.789" offset="839592">He relied somewhat on the cases in the Third Circuit which was the United States versus the Pennsylvania Refuse Haulers Association, which was a case under the Sherman Antitrust Act in which the Third Circuit held that the service and the disposal should be looked at together as a unit and they clearly were an item of interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.784" offset="947635">Then I believe he also considered the substance itself as an item called commerce because, as we know there are many, many items of solid waste that are traded, sold, and used.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.729" offset="1007403">Recently, this court decided the case of Hughes versus Alexandria which dealt with automobile hulk. This court clearly accepted the fact that automobile hulks were legitimate items of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.907" offset="1064141">Does that answer your question, sir?</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="249.387" offset="1097996">I wondered where you thought he rested in his wage.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="herbert_f_moore" startTime="252.579" stopTime="541.294">
            <label>Mr. Herbert F. Moore</label>
            <text syncTime="252.579" offset="1110848">He decided that on the basis, it was my understanding that the statute in New Jersey discriminated against interstate commerce, and that was it.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.482" offset="1154420">The other court in the companion case, which was decided by Justice Souter and who is now on the New Jersey Supreme Court, he decided that on the same basis, that it was a discrimination against interstate commerce and, therefore must full.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.647" offset="1219099">That is a little different case and of course, we were not involved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.765" offset="1231534">That was a totally different factual situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.810" offset="1255775">Now, I feel it is extremely important that we keep in the forth most of our mind the statute of New Jersey, fortunately, it is a very short statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.341" offset="1309796">I do not intend to read it, but I would like to point out some aspects of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.463" offset="1330381">The first section of the statute is a legislative finding in which the legislature determines that there has been a large volume of solid waste that has to be disposed of, both in New Jersey and out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.795" offset="1379700">That it presents a threat to the environment and appropriate landfill sites are being rapidly diminished and that the treatment and disposal of waste collected out of the state creates a public health safety and welfare nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.845" offset="1443857">Also, it is against it and it absolutely prohibits the treatment and disposal within New Jersey of all waste generated out of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.479" offset="1482414">We have in the fining clause an absolute prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.878" offset="1499968">Now, when we get to the actual statute itself for the legislative determination, very interestingly, it starts off with “no person shall bring into this state any solid or liquid waste which originated or was collected outside of the state except garbage to be fed to swine,” which, of course is a solid waste as we all know.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.952" offset="1588262">“Until a commissioner shall determine that such action,” and the action obviously has to go back to the bringing in.</text>
            <text syncTime="378.615" offset="1614907">That is what the statute is talking about, “can be permitted without endangering the public health.”</text>
            <text syncTime="385.025" offset="1640611">Now, we have approached this with the understanding that this statute paints with a very, very broad brush.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.704" offset="1679272">This statute is not directed against any particular type of disposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.884" offset="1700066">Incidentally, disposal in New Jersey includes treatment and processing and storage of solid or liquid waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.134" offset="1744996">This statute deals with prohibiting the entry into the state any item that travels into a moment, legitimately, in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.744" offset="1783449">That is designated to solid or liquid waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.114" offset="1808944">Now, the first question of course and when any statute that is tested against the Commerce Clause is to determine whether or not it is in fact commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.696" offset="1855233">Because, if it is not commerce, we are not in the ball game at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.997" offset="1872474">Now, in this particular incidence, solid and liquid waste, as I have mentioned just a moment ago in answer to the Chief Justice’s question, I pointed out that automobile hulks are obviously a solid waste, traditionally and historically all the byproducts of industry, many of them have commercial value.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.773" offset="1959618">You have your scrap metals, your scrap glass, and demolition material, and many, many other items that are used by various people in various concerns that are processed and treated, all of which are prohibited by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.180" offset="2049166">In the case of United States versus Pennsylvania Refuse, which was went to the Third Circuit, and I believe the certiorari was denied that case dealt specifically with, actually, what we are dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.789" offset="2107680">It was the movement of solid waste collected in Pennsylvania into New Jersey to be disposed of in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.965" offset="2144356">The question came up because the refuse haulers were being charged with criminal conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.360" offset="2165881">The question came up that you do not have jurisdiction under the Sherman Antitrust Act to prosecute these collectors because we are engaged in dealing with a worthless commodity, a worthless item and therefore, it is not of any commercial value, it is not commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.121" offset="2241009">Of course, as we all realize that the jurisdiction of the Sherman Antitrust Act depends upon the Commerce Clause.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="541.294" stopTime="551.927">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="541.294" offset="2265669">The Supreme Court of New Jersey that case Distinguish that case,did they not say that their congress affirmatively exercised his power, whereas, here you are relying simply on the negative implications of the constitutional provision?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="herbert_f_moore" startTime="551.927" stopTime="651.285">
            <label>Mr. Herbert F. Moore</label>
            <text syncTime="551.927" offset="2308196">Yes, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.207" offset="2313316">They came up with that type of reasoning which we do not agree with.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.335" offset="2329826">I do not quite fully understand it because, if it is not commerce for the purpose of enforcing anything under the Sherman Antitrust Act, then it is not commerce for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.191" offset="2381235">If it is commerce for under that Act and at least it is recognized as an item in commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.317" offset="2397744">Now, I think where the confusion developed perhaps is that there is a general body of law and understanding that when you are dealing with police powers of states and they are dealing with public health questions, this court and the constitution has gone to a great length to support police power actions in the public domain and as long as certain tests and standards are met, but, to say that automobile hulks, for example, was not commerce is just not a truism.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.322" offset="2561793">You have another aspect of this which is also very interesting and very important and that the people who are disposing in New Jersey at the present time of solid and liquid waste, some or all of it coming from out of state are private enterprise, they are public utilities as legislated by the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.342" offset="2645803">The collectors and the disposers are public utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.976" offset="2664402">They are dealing in a legitimate enterprise and they are depending for the source of their material to keep them in a commercial business items that flow in interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.383" offset="7334051">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.649" offset="7347112">The subject matter of this appeal is the disposal of solid waste in New Jersey and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.063" offset="7376787">Government, in the discharge of its responsibilities to provide for the health, welfare, and safety of its people, makes provision for the disposal of waste, either by performing the service itself or by supervising and regulating private contractors who perform the service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.060" offset="7452752">The case thus, involves the performance of a necessary public service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.380" offset="7478038">It is also clear though the state and its people pay a social cost for providing this public service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.036" offset="7512624">At the present time, the only viable method of solid waste disposal, with a few exceptions, is through landfills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.476" offset="7546374">This means that landfills are necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.382" offset="7562048">However, they are at best a necessary evil.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.697" offset="7575318">In New Jersey, virtually all landfills will produce a caliche, which is a highly noxious and polluted liquid that pollutes both ground and surface waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.443" offset="7622234">Landfills also generate methane gas such as used for cooking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.362" offset="7645953">Thus, fires at landfills may occur even decades after a landfill has been closed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.451" offset="7682316">Therefore, the disposal of waste is like crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.753" offset="7699452">If we could wish away the problem or legislate away the problem, we would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.891" offset="7724007">But, we cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.169" offset="7729127">We cannot simply say, no more waste in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.859" offset="7743965">We have to take care of the problem somehow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.534" offset="7754623">Provision is made by the state for the disposal of waste.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.695" offset="7771236">It allows the use of its land for this purpose, even though substantial and serious harm is caused to the land and to the environment from this particular form of land use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.611" offset="7838946">The question presented by this appeal is whether when a state, such as New Jersey authorizes this use of its land it must also, under the Commerce Clause, make available the use of its land to other states and their political subdivisions for this same purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.009" offset="7924523">I think it should be made clear at the outset because the point was perhaps somewhat blurred in the presentation of the appellant that the New Jersey statute being considered in this case, taken in tandem with the implementing regulations adapted pursuant thereto, prohibits solely the entry into New Jersey of solid waste intended for disposal in sanitary landfills.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.693" offset="8047298">I would direct the court’s particular attention to page 96A of the Appendix, which is a regulation adapted by the State Commissioner of Environmental Protection to become effective prior to the effective date of the statute which excludes from the purview of the prohibition upon entry into New Jersey, solid waste which is intended for any productive use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.846" offset="8163909">It excludes garbage to be fed to swines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.991" offset="8176448">It excludes solid waste to be processed into secondary materials.</text>
