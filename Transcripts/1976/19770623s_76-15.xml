            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100550">The judgment and opinion in 76-15, Continental T.V. against -- against GTE Sylvania, Incorporated will be announced by Mr. Justice Powell.</text>

            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="11.901" offset="148093">The respondent, Sylvania Incorporated, manufactures and sells television sets.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.722" offset="183410">In an effort to increase its declining sales, Sylvania adopted a franchise plan to sell directly to a more select group of franchise with retailers.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.119" offset="228968">It limited the number of franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.447" offset="238268">Franchise is granted to any given area and required each franchisee to sell its Sylvania products only from locations at which it was franchised.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.854" offset="291871">A dispute arose between Sylvania and one of the holders of the franchise, Continental T.V. in the litigation that followed, Continental contended that Sylvania had violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act by prohibiting the sale of Sylvania's TVs from other than specified locations.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.571" offset="390823">In a case -- in case that was here in 1967, United States against Schwinn, this Court annunciated a per se rule of liability when manufacturers imposed certain vertical restrictions on wholesalers and retailers of its products.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.291" offset="473683">The District Court in this case thought that the Schwinn per se rule was applicable and instructed the jury accordingly, a large verdict was rendered against Sylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.761" offset="523525">On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed finding a basis for the distinguishing the Schwinn rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.583" offset="558842">Although, we think no adequate basis for a distinction exists, we have reexamined the decision in Schwinn and conclude today that it should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.195" offset="601265">The per se rule of illegality adopted for the first time in that case was a departure from antitrust principles generally applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.811" offset="643792">Restrictions similar to those used by Sylvania are widely employed in our free market economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.772" offset="675557">The weight of scholarly and judicial authority supports their economic usefulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.313" offset="701784">Accordingly, we affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals that we do so on different grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.837" offset="727802">Mr. Justice White filed an opinion concurring in the result.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.487" offset="742431">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr. Justice Marshall has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.313" offset="769703">Mr. Justice Rehnquist took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
