            <text syncTime="17.746" offset="171959">This case is on appeal from the Illinois Supreme Court and concerns the question that whether the Illinois intestate succession statute, which excludes illegitimate children from inheritance from their fathers but grants such inheritance rights to all legitimate children, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.026" offset="257013">Deta Mona Trimble was born in 1970.</text>

            <text syncTime="68.760" offset="376027">Under the Illinois Probate Act, legitimate children inherit from either parent in intestacy, and the illegitimate child, on the other hand, will inherit from his or her mother but is not the heir of an intestate father.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.934" offset="432661">Pursuant to this statute, the Probate Court entered an order declaring Sherman Gordon’s heirs to be his parents’ siblings and a half-brother.</text>

            <text syncTime="96.385" offset="486473">The Illinois Supreme Court granted leave to appeal directly to the Trimbles and the Illinois Supreme Court then affirmed the Probate Court decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.145" offset="517506">There was no written opinion since the Court held that its decision four months earlier in the case of In re Estate of Karas was dispositive.</text>

            <text syncTime="1173.737" offset="4795946">There is no decision of this Court that has held that illegitimates are a suspect class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.062" offset="4817157">Therefore, we submit that the proper test to determine whether or not this particular statute violates the Equal Protection Clause is not the scrutiny test that counsel would ask us to adhere to, or even a higher scrutiny, but the reasonable basis test and whether or not this statute bears some rational relationship to a legitimate State purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.178" offset="4917676">I think in one of the questions, counsel was asked about that and if I may, I think that the State purposes that this statute serves are: (1) to encourage family relationships; (2) to regulate property of decedents who die intestate -- property that is located within the borders of the State; (3) the stability of land titles; and (4) the prompt and definitive determination of the valid ownership of property left by decedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.294" offset="5042123">Also, I would say along with that is the prompt adjudication of probate estates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.586" offset="5071276">Another one of the purposes would be to deter spurious claims, which I will get into.</text>

            <text syncTime="1287.994" offset="5252984">I suppose you are not defending the Illinois statute as a matter of policy if you were a legislator, when it says that the paternity suit or an acknowledgement is not enough, there has to be marriage in addition.</text>

            <text syncTime="1302.945" offset="5312752">Well, it stills set up a mechanism whereby the child can be recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.233" offset="5345875">Insofar as Labine, as counsel alluded to, said that when the father in Labine acknowledged the child, he could have also made another statement along with that acknowledgement, allowing the child to inherit, but he did not do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.493" offset="5414943">In this case, the decedent did not marry the mother of the child and did not acknowledge the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.085" offset="5441274">Now technically, the child was acknowledged for him in the paternity proceedings and it was an order that issued from the Circuit Court of Cook County deciding that he was the father and ordering him to pay support for the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.245" offset="5505954">Getting back to the state purposes, they were recognized as being valid not only in Labine but in this Court’s opinion in Weber v. Aetna.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.856" offset="5544406">Even though the Weber decision went the other way because it was discrimination, as I recall it, among illegitimates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.312" offset="5574186">It is clear that the power to make such rules, to bear that relationship to the state purposes should be left to the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.683" offset="5607727">Getting to the statutory will theory, I believe that the statutory will theory is a viable and valid theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.065" offset="5641268">I think that the laws on intestacy are an attempt by the State to determine to whom the decedent would want his property distributed if he were to die unexpectedly or without making a will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.874" offset="5696439">Now, the fact, as counsel alludes to that most people do not make wills, I think proves that people are satisfied with the legislative action in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.067" offset="5757252">For example, in Illinois, if there is no will and there is a surviving spouse and no children, the surviving souse I believe receives everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.141" offset="5797480">If there are children, the surviving spouse receives one third and the children receive two thirds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.962" offset="5820781">In this particular case, the decedent by making a will could have left everything to his child.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.913" offset="5848576">Now in Illinois, a surviving spouse if she is left out of the will can renounce the will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.784" offset="5868115">The children have no right to renounce the will and there is no right in a child in Illinois to inherit from its father.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.069" offset="5901239">That does not mean whether you are legitimate or illegitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.657" offset="5915554">You would give away to your mother, so to speak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.260" offset="5934048">She has the right to renounce the will and children do not have a right to renounce the will.</text>

            <text syncTime="1479.458" offset="6018790">So if the decedent had cut out of his children that were born before the after-born child, the after-born could take as if there was no will, even if the other children were cut out.</text>

            <text syncTime="1558.518" offset="6335080">I think one of the main problems here is the philosophical problem of whether or not, the fact that a child has been decreed to be the child of the decedent, if you will, means that, that child is the natural object of the decedent’s bounty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.986" offset="6412925">The child is the victim of an illicit relationship and I think that overwriting all of these concerns is the family relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2424.862" offset="9800380">The other point we want to make on this issue is that it is our contention that this Court’s decision in Labine v. Vincent controls, and it especially controls because in this case and under the facts of this situation, the father here could have done more for this child than could the father in Labine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.937" offset="9884703">For example in Labine, the child must be acknowledged in order to take under the father’s will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.046" offset="9917095">That is one thing that we have not heard yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.126" offset="9929425">You just could not make a will in Labine and leave your estate to the child under Louisiana law, which is just as Justice Marshall points out is entirely different from the other 49 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.822" offset="9976236">Then even if the child is acknowledged and you make a will leaving him part of your estate, you can only leave him either one-fourth or one-third of the estate, and that is if there are no surviving legitimate children or their heirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2481.476" offset="10026914">While in Illinois, Illinois has ameliorated the rule as you point out, Justice Stewart, a filius nullius, because if we made the rule he could leave the child everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.867" offset="10068396">Also, apparently in Louisiana, acknowledgement is a condition precedent to the child’s right to claim support from the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.601" offset="10099325">That is not true on Illinois, as is evident in this case because when a paternity suit is brought, the defendant does not have to plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.830" offset="10132239">He can put up a defense and if the court finds that he is guilty, then he never has to acknowledge the fact that he is the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="2514.150" offset="10157526">He is adjudicated the father and he is made to support the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.692" offset="10171737">Also in Louisiana, an acknowledged child can inherit from the father intestate if the father has no heirs or collateral or linear, to the exclusion only of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2527.828" offset="10212279">Of course in Illinois, an illegitimate can never inherit intestate from the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.462" offset="10226803">That is the main difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.153" offset="10237565">The other striking point is that in Louisiana, legitimate children have a right of forced heirship in their father’s estate, whereas in Illinois, as I pointed out, legitimate children do not have that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.954" offset="10288765">So that it is our contention that Labine would control even more in this case than it did on the facts of its own case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2579.654" offset="10419586">When the notice of appeal was originally filed in this case, from the order of the Probate Court of county declaring the heirship, only the mother was named as an appellant in only a representative capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.381" offset="10470473">She was named as Jessie Trimble as the mother and next friend of the child, Deta Mona Trimble.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.246" offset="10501924">So that we do not believe she is a proper appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.373" offset="10514463">Now the record got pretty muddied up because what happened after that was, when they made their motion under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 302(b) for a direct appeal to the Illinois Supreme Court, thus bypassing the Appellate Court, you do that in matters of importance that require proper termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.092" offset="10597323">All of a sudden, she became an appellant and there is nothing in the record, nobody objected to it I have to admit that, but she suddenly became an appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.858" offset="10636403">Then she also became an appellant in a notice of appeal to this Court and in her brief amicus curiae in the Karas case, she as named as a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.901" offset="10680602">But the fact is that under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 301, the notice of appeal is a jurisdictional stock and I do not think that anybody can waive it by not arguing it and I do not think anybody can cure it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2656.401" offset="10726577">So I do not really believe that she is a proper party in this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2937.825" offset="11852246">Just one point, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.142" offset="11857575">I believe the standing issues are fully treated in the briefs and I just would like to point out that most of the arguments that opposing counsel has made have been implicitly or explicitly rejected by this Court’s unanimous decision in Reed v. Reed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.327" offset="11914313">In Reed, a case involving the estate of less than $1000 by the way, this Court, where there was sex discrimination in the appointment of administrators in intestate estates, this Court rejected the constitutionality of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.193" offset="11981709">Even though it recognized that it eased the Probate Court’s administrative burden or judicial burden, and even though most of those sexually discriminatory appointments could have been altered by a will of the decedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.822" offset="12044298">The Reed case is structured very much the way this case is, and this Court unanimously rejected the same structure in a similar context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.005" offset="12080974">Sex, like illegitimacy, has not been treated as a suspect class by a majority of the Court, but also there is many of the same traditional indicia and we just call that to the Court’s attention.</text>

            <text syncTime="3029.620" offset="12219423">Well, I believe that this case is clearly stronger than Labine on the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.936" offset="12240739">First, there was an adjudication here of the father’s paternity for all purposes and Illinois has said that this is this father’s child or was this father’s child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.727" offset="12283893">Now the Illinois Supreme Court turns around and says, but there are proof problems.</text>

            <text syncTime="3053.543" offset="12315136">It is stronger than Labine in that sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.955" offset="12324749">Secondly, the Labine scheme, as I mentioned, was inclusive of illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.411" offset="12350558">This Court has consistently struck down total exclusions of illegitimate children from any statutory scheme in the last eight years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.568" offset="12387234">The two partial exceptions have been Labine and Lucas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.835" offset="12400295">In both of those cases, there were substantial benefits to the class of illegitimate children.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.236" offset="12425895">Labine may not have been as carefully tuned as Lucas was, but it was significantly inclusive.</text>
