            <label>Mr. Robert H. Bork</label>
            <text syncTime="56.528" offset="326534">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.151" offset="333117">We are here on writ of Certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.601" offset="350881">That Court sitting en banc and held with one dissent of United States District Court for the District of Columbia has jurisdiction to entertain Respondent Pressley’s application for a writ of habeas corpus seeking post conviction relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.408" offset="406051">The conviction from which he seeks relief occurred in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.936" offset="428203">We contend that the District Court has no jurisdiction to entertain such applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.036" offset="456624">The issue was obviously important one to the objectives Congress sought to attain in the 1970 reorganization of the Court system in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.429" offset="494136">Major part of that before in reorganization was intended to relieve the District Court system of local criminal law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.028" offset="552546">The judgment of the Court of Appeals which we think to have reversed brings the District Court back in part into local criminal law matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.961" offset="592356">The issue in this case is first, the meaning and second, the constitutionality of Section 110 (g) of Title III of the District of Columbia Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.097" offset="640840">Meaning is rather clear in the Section 110 (g) deprives the District Court jurisdiction over applications for habeas corpus by those who have been convicted in the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.874" offset="696010">The Court of Appeals held to the contrary that 110 (g) is a mere exhaustion of remedies provision so that prisoners must seek relief initially in the Superior Court but may then.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.465" offset="750345">If that relief is denied, proceed into the District Court with the same application, knowing construing the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.782" offset="779602">The Court of Appeals stated, indeed insisted, that its interpretation was heavily influenced by its desire to avoid constitutional issues which is regard to this trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.883" offset="831952">Always there are two propositions: the first is the Section 110 (g) is so clear and so unambiguous in denying jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.183" offset="869254">The Federal District Courts in a case such as this one that no amount of constitutional concern can justify interpreting the statute as a mere exhaustion of remedies provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.530" offset="914603">It is clear what Congress has done and there is no legitimate way to avoid constitutional issues if constitutional issues there be.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.439" offset="950234">My second point therefore is that 110 (g) of the District Code passes the relevant constitutional tests and does so relevantly easily.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.867" offset="995896">I would like to turn first to the statutory question.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.038" offset="1016585">110, as a general manner, gives Superior Court the power to entertain collateral tax upon its own senses, and that power is just as broad in scope and of the same nature as a collateral attack would be in the Federal District Court under 2255, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.865" offset="1099968">Now, the relevant language to this case which is in 110 (g) is this: “An application for a writ of habeas corpus shall not be entertained by any Federal Court if it appears that the applicant has failed to make a motion for relief under this section or that the Superior Court has denied him relief.”</text>
            <text syncTime="278.811" offset="1215743">I can think of no way that language could be made clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.864" offset="1231939">No Federal Court may entertain the Superior Court, convict’s habeas corpus petition if the convict has not made a motion in the Superior Court or if he has done so and lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.755" offset="1287527">There are two clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.533" offset="1290557">The first one is an exhaustion of remedies provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.120" offset="1304977">The second one is clearly a denial of jurisdiction provision and to read second clause as a mere exhaustion of remedies provision is to read it out with the statute which I submit is not interpretation, it is revealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.612" offset="1366939">This is not a case like Gusik v. Schilder, where the Court through it would have required a strain to read the finality language as other than the exhaustion of remedies provision and if refused to strain the language in order to reach a constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.633" offset="1443008">I think this can be made clear if you ask yourself, what would congress do?</text>
            <text syncTime="341.337" offset="1465787">If it meant this to be a denial of jurisdiction, what would it do after the Court of Appeals’ decision in order to make that fact clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.075" offset="1508732">I cannot think of anything, that will make it clear unless it italicize that language in the code, and then said, we really mean the italicized language.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.261" offset="1549483">It is done as much as it can to make this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.285" offset="1565574">Now, there is much argument about the legislative history in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.471" offset="1578322">The truth is there is very little legislative history in this case; it is very enlightened.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.753" offset="1603504">But, the Court of Appeals to some extent responded, used an argument which is a wide variety of arguments none of which from the legislative history really go to overturn the language in the text, but we do know two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.160" offset="1677065">We do know that Congress intended to remove local matters from the Federal District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.640" offset="1714995">We know that the statute does that as we read it, and that supports it, but more importantly is the fact that Section 110 (g) is model.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.662" offset="1751148">The Congress said, it was using as a model 28 U.S.C. 2255 and indeed the language is almost identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.823" offset="1795765">We know that 2255 the post conviction relief statute is not an exhaustion of remedy statute, it is a jurisdictional statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.409" offset="1834113">It says that you must go back to the sentencing court to get your post conviction relief, you may go and replace else and that tends to remove the jurisdiction from all other courts, but the sentencing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.113" offset="1884895">110 (g) copies that language and removes jurisdiction from any court other than the sentencing court, which in this case is the Superior Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.241" offset="1929408">I suppose if there is any difference between the two and there is, it is that 110 (g) is even clear, because whereas 2255 simply says that the motion shall not be entertained, language was added to 110 (g) in the District Court and say the motion shall not be entertained by the Superior Court or by any Federal or State Court which (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="483.512" offset="2034525">Now, against all of this the Court of Appeals replaces reliance one, two points, the first one is that the local court system of District of Columbia, the Article I court system was intended to be in many respects analogous to a state court system, and that is quite true, but an analogy is by no means of identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.682" offset="2111220">This system differs in many respects, and one of them is the respect, which is plainly before us here.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.233" offset="2137447">The second part of reliance was the Congress could not have meant what it plainly said because that would have provoked heated constitutional debate, and there was none.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.078" offset="2184781">The answer to that is that there was no constitutional excitement, because Congress had done the same thing 20 years before, and there had been no constitutional excitement about that and it probably could completely do the same thing again.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.805" offset="2255730">Under 2255 collateral attacks, upon sentences imposed by territorial courts organized in the Article IV of the constitution, and non Article III court must be brought exclusively by motion in those courts, which is parallel to situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.811" offset="2323752">No court has suggested that the unconstitutional will send those is unconstitutional to require a person convicted in the territorial court to go back for his post-conviction relief under 2255 to that sentencing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.389" offset="2374012">So there was no occasion for Congress to think that there was anything unique or exciting or troublesome about what it was doing in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.569" offset="2426779">I think the statutory argument is clear, so I turn to the constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.020" offset="2448513">Now, the constitutional objection really is that although respondent maybe constitutionally convicted and sentenced in an Article I court created for the District Court of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.590" offset="2510789">He may not be required to seek his post-conviction relief in that same court.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.723" offset="2535344">I think this court’s decision in United States against Palmore affectively disposes of that contention is implausible that a person who can be tried initially, constitutionally in such a court may not have his post-conviction relief motion determined by such a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.571" offset="2622802">I think that is not with the case, but the argument is dressed up here by a statement that to require a convict to go back to the Superior Court is to spend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, which contravenes Article I, Section 9, Clause 2 of the constitution and also the Court of Appeals suggested contravenes the protection concept of the Due Process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.182" offset="2749235">Neither of those claims I think is plausible after Palmore and I will say a few words.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.339" offset="2773790">The suggestion that 110 (g) violates the suspension clause is dispose quite quickly I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.124" offset="2800957">It is our position expressed in our brief that history shows that the guarantee of the suspension clause was not intended to apply to any post-conviction applications for habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.685" offset="2859263">At the time the constitution was drafted and adopted, the common law rule was that the post-conviction application for habeas corpus could be defeated by showing that there was a judgment in conviction by a criminal court of general jurisdiction, and that is our position so the Congress would be free to wish to suspend the writ entirely, but we don’t rest upon that.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.598" offset="2954871">Our main point, we may not reach that historical point because our main point is clear that what was done here was in no sense a suspension of the privilege of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.624" offset="2994995">It’s exactly the motion under 110 (g) or under 110 is exactly commensurate with the writ of habeas corpus as is exactly commensurate with 2255, so there is no suspension of the writ in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.476" offset="3078378">The nature of the relief is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.225" offset="3085379">The grounds upon which it can be cited are the same, the procedure is the same, and the only difference that is pointed to is that the court considered the motion is to create under Article I rather than the Article III because I say I think Palmore answers that contention, because if Article I court given the special powers of Congress or the District of Columbia is capable of providing a legitimate constitutional trial, and I think is capable of providing a legitimate constitutional post-conviction review.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.652" offset="3247129">Besides, it is clear that we are dealing that the purpose of the suspension clause was to prevent the effective denial of the writ altogether and was not to regulate -- prohibit Congress from regulating the details, its procedural details.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.747" offset="3327481">Otherwise, if that is not true we are going to get in the questions about whether the new rules which allow the dismissal of a motion one of the latest filing prejudices the government was that is a suspension or the privilege of the writ or as the rules were originally promulgated, I understand that they required, is that an application under 2255(b) sworn to during oath.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.721" offset="3427374">Let us suppose we have an argument about whether that is a suspension of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.506" offset="3442525">I think it is quite clear that those procedural details are not -- would beyond Congress’s power by this suspension clause, and certainly here when you have federal judges appointed by the President, confirmed by the Senate, 15-year terms and with a post-conviction procedure, which is specified by the Congress and is as broad as the writ of habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.586" offset="3566867">It seems to me that it is impossible to say that there is any suspension of the writ.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.289" offset="3597587">The Court of Appeals had attained some speculations about the equal protection concept, which respondent has not pressed here particularly, but I think I should mention him any of them because they are in the opinion below.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.702" offset="3655266">The theory apparently is that equal protection maybe in question, because under 28 U.S.C. 2254, a person convicted in the state court may petition an Article III Court for post-conviction collateral attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.352" offset="3733842">While a Superior Court found that the District of Columbia must petition in Article I court.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.205" offset="3757248">It seems to me that this is nothing more than the Suspension Clause argument all over again, ends up once more in for that reason it’s answered by the Palmore decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.701" offset="3795282">The argument whether it is a suspension clause or whether it is placed in the equal protection context is always contains the hidden assumption that the Superior Court is less legitimate in some way than an Article III court is, and if that assumption is rejected as it was in Palmore then I think there is no equal protection issue here just as there is no Suspension Clause issue here, and I think that is the end of the matter but I suppose there are two other or few other points that should be mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.629" offset="3922969">The equal protection concept obviously does not encompass the right to deprive the particular tribunal.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.048" offset="3952644">If the remedies available are equal then I think there is no problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="968.830" offset="3975841">Well, it does not this there are little more to the equal protection argument then you suggest in that prisoners who are convicted in any of the state forums, which are presumably legitimate nonetheless have the right to petitioner Federal District Court for habeas and affect someone convicted in the District of Columbia Court is the only person who does not have the right to petition to Federal District Court for habeas.</text>

            <text syncTime="1014.788" offset="4159638">There is something less legitimate about in Article I court than there is -- less legitimate Article I court than an Article III court because if that assumption is not present and there is really no denial of equal protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="1802.976" offset="7312409">The justice department explained to Congress what the statute meant and Congress adopted the justice department’s words, explanation of what the statute meant in so many words, and the exact words which were picked up from the report that accompanied the statute when it represented the Congress and carried on through the Senate, through the House, through the conference report are these.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.344" offset="7393806">Section 110 is new, rather than relying upon the inherent power of the Superior Court to review judgments of conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.089" offset="7424840">The news that section provides statutory procedures for post-conviction challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.219" offset="7445320">Section 110 is modeled upon 28 U.S.C. Section 2255 with only the necessary technical changes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1851.795" offset="7507700">It refers to two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.856" offset="7515850">The first is the case of Burke v. United States where the old Article I courts in the District of Columbia talking about whether or not they had the power to review their own judgments of conviction said, the power of the juvenile court to vacate sentence maybe regarded as inherent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.067" offset="7576768">The very words that appear in the legislative history and again in the Ingle’s case the court said the municipal court has inheritance power to vacate a sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2705.474" offset="10922322">What the lynchpin of the organization the way the constitution was put together and still stands is the idea that federal judges were going to be these judges who had no local bias, no local -- at least they were protected from the passions of the moment and political vogue by the salary and tenure protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.040" offset="11000585">That makes them different in my view from any of the judge who does not have those protections, and this court has said repeatedly that any substitute for federal habeas corpus must be exactly commensurate.</text>

            <text syncTime="2757.647" offset="11131093">It’s just that Article III is not required here and my argument let me be perfectly clear on this federal constitutional point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2764.926" offset="11160141">My argument is not that Article III requires that these federal constitutional questions be heard in Article III courts; it is that the Suspension Clause requires that these questions to be heard --</text>

            <text syncTime="2810.215" offset="11341326">I think that that argument suffers from the fact that those words have been interpreted many times by this court in the 2255 context and they have been held not to mean that in the particular form.</text>

            <text syncTime="3014.589" offset="12158854">Well, there are other examples of course the special courts that have been set up through our history of Article I courts and in every case where an Article I court has or any non-Article III authority of United States has the power to lock people up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.485" offset="12210368">This court and the other Federal Courts have always found without exception that the writ of federal habeas corpus would reach those people everyone, and that is of course one of the major differences between this case and Palmore because this court in Palmore was faced with many examples of people who could be tried and convicted in non-Article III courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.031" offset="12288631">But in this case it is not faced with an example of anyone who could be confined by the power of the United States and could not ultimately go after exhaustion to a federal Article III court for resolution of his federal constitutional plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.537" offset="12346623">There is no such case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.080" offset="12352787">And many times in our history, in our legislative history Congress has passed statutes, which would appear to reach the result and I once again force to disagree with the Solicitor General and Gusik case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.532" offset="12414645">This court was faced by a statute which says that judgments of court’s Marshall shall be final binding and conclusive on all courts of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.947" offset="12452262">How much clear could it be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.497" offset="12458427">This court said unanimously that language means that you must exhaust your remedies in the Article I courts before you present your question to the federal Article III courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.883" offset="12503984">It is the same question that is presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.745" offset="12515478">Does a statute -- is this a finality statute or exhaustion statute or it is the other side of the same coin, and I would claim that the same considerations, which move the court to say if we decide otherwise that this is not a finality statute in Gusik.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.279" offset="12573574">It is going to launch us into an area of constitution that we have not yet adjudicated and is not necessary on the statute though it was reasonably clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.918" offset="12608161">It is no way to argue that final binding conclusive could be anymore clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.912" offset="12628118">Nonetheless this court compelled to avoid the issue where it was fairly possible to do some, and that is my argument to the court here today on this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.601" offset="12662913">Now, the government withdraws much solace from the fact that the words not bars from 2255, and yet it must be clear that they have a different purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.016" offset="12696559">2255 was an effective traffic rule; it said, we don’t want to -- we are going to direct this litigation, we are going to spread it out overall the circuits, because it is unfairly lumped up in Kansas and in Albatross where the big federal prisons were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.069" offset="12752774">That problem does not exist in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.587" offset="12762805">There is no traffic problem here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3169.489" offset="12778479">Therefore, the words of 2255 could not have been barred to the same purpose; they were barred from some other purpose and I would suggest to this court that the way, the place to look for what that purpose would have been is to the statute, the federal statute which regulates these relations in the state federal analogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.815" offset="12847756">Now, I am not arguing that Congress created the 51st state when it reorganized the courts in the District of Columbia.</text>
