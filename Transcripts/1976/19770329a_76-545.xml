            <text syncTime="42.042" offset="268663">May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.748" offset="283501">This case arises generally out of the same no-marriage rule which we had occasion to examine in the Evans case, but presents an entirely different question.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.693" offset="323311">The question here is the status of unnamed class members after denial of class by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.683" offset="363226">This case is a corollary of American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. versus Utah, 414 U. S. 538, decided by this Court in 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.058" offset="404709">Because this relies so heavily on American Pipe, by which we don’t want to indulge, we would briefly state the circumstances there.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.063" offset="432712">In American Pipe, a class action was filed eleven days before the statutory period would have otherwise expired.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.307" offset="461760">The District Court ultimately denied class status on the basis of numerosity, so nine months after the suit was filed and leaving eleven days left for the statutory period to run, which includes it, I suppose.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.161" offset="513169">Within eight days, a number of interveners came in, attempted to intervene, and the District Court held intervention was untimely, because since class had been denied, the tolling which occurred on the filing of the suit was retroactively un-tolled and since the eleven days had long since expired, they were late.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.807" offset="583700">The interveners then appealed the denial of intervention.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.146" offset="601045">It ultimately came to this Court, and the Court held that on the filing examined the practice under Rule 23 prior to the 1966 amendments, one-way intervention problems and matters of that kind, and then stated as the general rule that when a class action is filed, it tolls the time limitations for all unnamed potential class members -- whether they were aware of the suit or unaware of the suit was a matter of indifference -- but that that tolling continued only until the motion to strip the suit of its class-action character was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.619" offset="750988">Since that decision was made --</text>

            <text syncTime="182.331" offset="829773">And class action having been denied, the statutory period began to run again; but since they had coming within eight days, they were timely and the interventions were allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.716" offset="875331">In the case here, Ms. McDonald has come in three years after class-action denial; in fact, after the final order of dismissal upon which this suit was settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.733" offset="923396">Since the circumstances out of which the particular instance arise here, I am going to briefly recapitulate the history of the immediate litigation which gave rise to this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="232.588" offset="1030812">It is our position there were 62 days left…</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart Bernstein</label>
            <text syncTime="236.154" offset="1045127">… and here’s the mathematics on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.625" offset="1054949">At the time the suit was filed, it had to be filed within 30 days if my time’s right; yes, 30 days of receipt of the suit letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.834" offset="1087863">It was filed two days short of the expiration date; thus, there were two days left.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.863" offset="1107925">By the time class was denied, the statutory period had been enlarged to 90 days, and so we are deducting the 28 days from the 90 days, which leaves a net of 62 days that were left in our theory for Ms. McDonald to have acted.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="268.332" offset="1173858">Mr. Bernstein, would you comment somewhere doing your argument on what seems to me some difference within American Pipe and this case, in that in American Pipe all the courts assumed that the District Court’s denial of class certification was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.628" offset="1234985">That was not challenged, and here the Seventh Circuit reversed the denial of class certification.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_bernstein" startTime="289.442" stopTime="684.241">
            <label>Mr. Stuart Bernstein</label>
            <text syncTime="289.442" offset="1258286">Yes, sir, I will get to that, and I think that is a critical point, because in our view the Seventh Circuit had no power -- and “power” is its term, not mine.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.847" offset="1291827">I believe the Seventh Circuit had no power to decide that question, because it did not have a party before it. It first had to decide whether intervention was proper before it could get to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.080" offset="1332787">I will subsequently argue to the Court that the basis upon which the Court of Appeals decided that intervention was timely was improper; but the way the Court proceeded was to say, “We hold the intervention was timely here, because it wasn’t until after the final dismissal of this case that Ms. McDonald knew that the named claimants were not going to appeal class; therefore, it was timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.923" offset="1424216">Now, we find it timely; therefore, we have the power to examine the question of class.”</text>
            <text syncTime="335.050" offset="1440725">We say it’s just the other way around; the District Court held that intervention was untimely coming this late, and that that should have ended the case in our view and never gotten to the second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.992" offset="1484506">There were two Notices of Appeal filed, one on the denial of an intervention and one on the class question.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.527" offset="1510629">Our point was that once it… it should have gotten only to that first one, the proper decision should have been that it was not timely -- coming in three years late was not timely -- and therefore we never get to the second point.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.637" offset="1563083">But I would like to develop that through the history of this litigation, if I may, please.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.419" offset="1582204">As I indicated earlier, it was November of 1968 that United terminated the no-marriage policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.087" offset="1608849">Two weeks later, a suit was filed against it, Sprogis suit, also referred to during the course of the evidence argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.739" offset="1635494">It was an individual action filed by Mrs. Sprogis on her own behalf, claiming that the policy was a violation of the sex-discrimination provisions of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.552" offset="1678648">The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Mrs. Sprogis; the Court of Appeals affirmed it in a two-to-one decision, and dissent was by Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.636" offset="1723057">This Court denied certiorari sometime in 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.240" offset="1737476">While these appeals were pending, while the appeal was pending of the Sprogis case, another suit was filed by the same counsel, making the same allegations; but now, it was a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.753" offset="1783452">This is the Romasanta case, and there it was alleged that the class would consist of all stewardesses who had been discharged under this policy and that the class numbered some 27 or 28.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.683" offset="1831203">These are the allegations in the record in the complaint and in the record before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.858" offset="1855968">The Court held this on the past case calendar pending the result of the appeal in the Sprogis case, which was then up before the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.389" offset="1886061">When Sprogis was decided by the District Court, the counsel for Mrs. Sprogis asked the Court to at that point make a class action out of it; that is, after the decision on the merits of Sprogis, which had been started as an individual case, be converted into a class case, and that was one of the issue on appeal, where after decision on the merits, an individual case action could be converted into a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.736" offset="1983445">The Court of Appeals said that the District Court had the power to entertain such a motion, but should be mindful of the principles of Rule 23.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.010" offset="2012493">In a remand, then, Romasanta, the class-action case, Sprogis the remanded individual case on conversion of the class, motions were made then to consolidate those two cases by joint counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.219" offset="2077381">We resisted the motion to consolidate and the motion to convert Sprogis into a class action, and the Court granted our motion and did deny class relief in the Sprogis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.307" offset="2125760">There were no attempted interventions at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.841" offset="2135896">Consolidation was denied, Sprogis was referred to a Special Master for a determination of a back-pay award and ultimately Mrs. Sprogis was granted some $10,000 in back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.155" offset="2181140">She had, incidentally, been back to work early in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.368" offset="2197963">Shortly after she filed her suit, she was offered re-employment with seniority, and she did come back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.986" offset="2224399">It’s clear she had filed a timely charge under the act; there is no question of timeliness connected with that whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.236" offset="2261388">The Sprogis case was appealed, but not on the denial of class action; it was appealed on denial of attorney fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.501" offset="2290541">The District Court refused to allow attorney fees in that case because of what it felt was some impropriety in the sponsorship of the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.279" offset="2325649">That has no relevance to this case and no more need to pursue that, but attorney fees were denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.767" offset="2343517">There was a cross-appeal on the question of the measure of damages and back pay, what duty did the discriminatee have to mitigate, and the Court had held that the burden was on United Airlines to prove that there was not due care exercised in mitigation rather than on the discriminatee to prove that, in fact, attempts had been made to mitigate.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.243" offset="2425437">Well, all that held up the proceedings in the Romasanta case.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.672" offset="2439125">When that was all out of the way, then we foiled a motion to strike the class-action allegations in the second case, in the Romasanta case, and in December 6th of 1972 Judge Powell did grant our motion, struck the class action generally on a theory that since its time had passed and since it was not possible to know whether a stewardess terminated did so because of the rule or despite the rule; and there was evidence, as I had indicated earlier, that many employees quit their employment or waited for discharge in any event and that it wasn’t necessarily because of the rule, but because of marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.510" offset="2614563">He found that there had to be some manifestation on their part that they really were interested in continued employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.137" offset="2637029">But so he limited the class to those who had filed grievances or had taken some action before the Commission, the Federal Commission, the EEOC, or before some State agency, the New York Civil Rights Commission, the Illinois Fair Employment Practice Commission and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.466" offset="2694394">He then entertained intervention, provisions to intervene by 25 interveners, and he granted the intervention petitions of 13 and denied them as to the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.596" offset="2734831">One of the other factors was that a number of the stewardesses had settled their claims, entered into settlement agreements with United.</text>
            <text syncTime="665.550" offset="2762730">He said they were bound by those.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.287" offset="2769626">Others had instituted litigation in other courts, and he didn’t permit those to come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.460" offset="2790315">So he held the class to be a narrow one and, based on that holding, said that numerosity failed and, therefore, the intervention would be allowed; and as I say, 13 intervened, 12 were disallowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.195" offset="2829290">There were no attempts to appeal the denials of intervention.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="684.241" offset="2837440">The class certification was denied on the grounds that the identifiable plaintiffs were sufficiently small in number, the class action wasn’t warranted.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart Bernstein</label>
            <text syncTime="694.531" offset="2878609">That’s correct, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.427" offset="2882162">That’s correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.258" offset="2893551">There were no attempts to appeal the denial of intervention in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.862" offset="2907971">Counsel for plaintiffs did attempt a 1292(b) permissive appeal for the denial of class, and that was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.600" offset="2946841">But that appeal was by the named plaintiffs, not by the interveners who had been not allowed to intervene with respect to whom the case was over, and the order was final and with respect to whom an appeal would not have been interlocutory.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.559" offset="3002743">No attempt at that time was made by Ms. McDonald to intervene.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.460" offset="3018312">Well, then counsel for both sides entered into settlement discussions.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.301" offset="3037643">They had some 13 interveners, 2 named plaintiffs at that time, and they tried to settle up their differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.485" offset="3062407">There was no question then about the liability; that had already been settled in Sprogis in 71.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.269" offset="3081528">The only question was how much back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.398" offset="3090097">And again, most of the reinstatements had been cleared out because of the earlier tender.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.336" offset="3113816">Finally, in October 2 of 1975, three years later, an Agreed Order of Settlement was arrived at between counsel for both parties; back pay was agreed upon, and an order was entered by the Court dismissing the case with prejudice, reciting that the settlements had been agreed upon and that there were no further claims to be adjudicated; and as I say, the case was dismissed with prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.294" offset="3233666">It was two weeks after that that Ms. McDonald first appeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.249" offset="3253519">Now this would have been seven years after she was terminated, five years after the case started, and three years after class action was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.563" offset="3286746">She submitted an affidavit at that time, saying that when she was terminated in September of 1968, she didn’t do anything on her own behalf, because she knew other people were doing something about it and she was relying on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.224" offset="3333349">Mr. Justice Rehnquist referred to the extraordinary foresight which might have been present in his questioning of Mr. Kessler earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.296" offset="3357695">But here was a great bit of foresight, because at that time, in September of 1968, this Court hadn’t decided in the Albemarle case that a class action was appropriate for back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.334" offset="3397819">The only decision in the area at that time was an August 1968 decision of the Fifth Circuit in Oatis versus Crown Zellerbach, which said you could have class action for reinstatement for injunctive relief, but not for back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.289" offset="3453617">So this was great prescience that was exercised Ms. McDonald in September of 1968 to do nothing on her own behalf and rely on other people.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.020" offset="3484546">And as I indicated, the first suit filed two weeks later in November of 68 was an individual action, not a class action; the class action did not come until 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.843" offset="3535850">Well, now, what is the application in this circumstance of the principles of American Pipe?</text>
            <text syncTime="864.457" offset="3558315">It is our position that when the Court denied class in December of 1962, at that time it was incumbent upon Ms. McDonald to act.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.210" offset="3621323">Her affidavit says she knew that the Court had denied class, and her affidavit says, “I knew I was excluded from this case.”</text>
            <text syncTime="888.950" offset="3656327">But she took no action.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.630" offset="3666985">It is our position that when those 62 days ran out that she was time-barred; that if she wanted to get into this case, she should have acted within that period.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.503" offset="3706482">She should have asked the District judge to modify the order, his ruling on the class motion; if it wasn’t suitable to her, he has the power to modify.</text>

            <text syncTime="1160.801" offset="4743648">Now, we come to the problem here where a class would be asked for which exceeds any class asked for by the parties in the original litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1899.080" offset="7696843">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.118" offset="7724950">The notion that this case involves American Pipe, we think, is misplaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.359" offset="7745953">We think this case involves a very conventional kind of intervention question under Rule 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.654" offset="7779076">American Pipe was a case where the persons excluded by the class ruling determined they wanted to bring individual actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.443" offset="7818260">They brought individual actions, they chose to bring them in Utah in the same form as American Pipe had pending.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.855" offset="7839889">This Court held in American Pipe that those persons had the benefit of a tolling during the pendency of the class action or until the class was adversely determined and, since they filed within eight days of that, they were timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.892" offset="7892030">But those interveners took the case as they found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.325" offset="7905822">As far as the records go of the lower court decisions, they were not interested at all in challenging the adverse class ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.928" offset="7936229">It was by an experienced judge who had handled a number of similar cases, and apparently it seemed to them that his reasons were pretty good.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.640" offset="7967053">Instead of taking a chance on a procedural appeal years later, they came into that court and said, “We will hazard our luck in that form.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.577" offset="8002789">We took just the opposite track.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.942" offset="8012297">In this case, we relied on our class champions until final judgment was entered; we then learned that they were going to abandon us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.465" offset="8042390">At that point, we only had one choice; we had to continue this case through appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.621" offset="8059004">That’s exactly what we did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.246" offset="8065483">We took the case as we found it with whatever inadequacies it might have had as far as timeliness or the measure of remedy that had been determined in earlier phases, and we staked our all on continuing that case through appeal.</text>

            <text syncTime="2656.583" offset="10726838">And as construed by this Court, that means you look at all the circumstances and you ask yourself, did the intervener act reasonably?</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.554" offset="10758707">In this case, the Seventh Circuit found, first of all, that she acted as soon as her class champions had indicated to her that they would no longer continue to advance her interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.464" offset="10798309">Secondly, they concluded there was no prejudice to United. United knew, or should have known since this case was filed and it’s based on substantial exposure to a great number of people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.955" offset="10840314">It had decided to run its airline on a policy of having primary services, it took a risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.363" offset="10861943">The law was changed; but three years after that law was changed, it persisted in its policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.477" offset="10878348">It's a mature business corporation, and if it lost, it lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.504" offset="10890469">When this suit was filed, I think it had no doubt that it faced substantial exposure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.058" offset="10908755">The only difference about this case is that the appeal was prosecuted not by Romasanta, but by McDonald.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.187" offset="10945221">There is no other difference as far as I can see in where we are today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2715.348" offset="10961835">The second point that Mr. Bernstein made which troubled me is the notion that somehow what we did will impede settlements; that somehow it's only possible for defendants to settle these cases if they can buy off the right of appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.312" offset="11017737">Well, I suggest to this Court that that’s not the kind of settlement that should be encouraged on any kind of case and certainly not in Title VII, where Congress has made clear and this Court has made clear that every effort should be made to accord class-wide relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.958" offset="11072281">And in fact, in this case, the named plaintiffs in no way sold out their right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2747.131" offset="11088999">There’s not one word in the settlement agreement that they promised not to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.973" offset="11104359">The usual way you handle this, I’m informed, is, you hold off paying out the money till 31 days have expired.</text>

            <text syncTime="2870.315" offset="11581773">But I think the only way to look at it is, once the Seventh Circuit has ruled, it’s, I suppose, a nunc pro tunc order.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.153" offset="11601104">We’re back as if the ruling hadn’t been made, the erroneous ruling hadn’t been made in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.334" offset="11621793">I suppose that if you look at this kind of case over the course of a decade, from 1968 to 1977, you wonder if there isn’t a better way of handling this; and I suppose there must be, because I don’t think a case should go on this long.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.317" offset="11677799">But if you look at each step along the line, I think you can explain why it happened that ten years after the cause of action arose, we’re still in a court and we’re a long way from a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.960" offset="11720327">But I suggest that none of those reasons are sufficient to hold that the people who are injured by United Airlines’ wrongdoing should never get appellate review of an erroneous class order, and they should never get the relief that it seems to me they have been entitled to for the last decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2920.323" offset="11781767">It's not our fault that we are here today.</text>

            <text syncTime="2926.071" offset="11804755">I think that all the Court need find, as the Seventh Circuit did, is, we have acted reasonably in light of what we knew and in light of what the law said we should do, and I suggest the decision below should be affirmed.</text>
