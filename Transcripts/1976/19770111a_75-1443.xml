            <label>Mr. Maurice Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="65.101" offset="360950">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.905" offset="384146">The question presented here is whether the Federal Courts have jurisdiction to review the refusal by the Secretary of HEW to reopen a disability claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.443" offset="438272">The disability claim was presented and decided some seven years before, and the Secretary, at that time, made a decision denying the claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.419" offset="490203">The history of the case falls into two chapters:</text>
            <text syncTime="102.475" offset="510370">The first chapter was in the period January, 1964 to June, 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.687" offset="543284">In that period, the respondent made a claim to the Social Security Administration for Disability Benefits, it received initial consideration and was rejected; it received reconsideration and was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.600" offset="610889">He asked for a hearing, he received a hearing, evidence was submitted, the examiner made a lengthy decision and in the lengthy decision which he rendered, the Hearing Examiner now an Administrative Law Judge, by title, the Hearing Examiner found that the respondent had not qualified for insured status up to the point when he had submitted his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.671" offset="743173">His insured status had come to an end in June of 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.167" offset="765221">He had not submitted his claim until 1964 and he was not in insured status at the time he contended when disability struck.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.417" offset="810151">The Hearing Examiner further found that he was not disabled at all within the meaning of the statute at the time when he was within insured status.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.953" offset="864277">The respondent then appealed to the Appeals Council in the Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.813" offset="883712">The Appeals Council affirmed the Administrative Law Judge, told in its affirmance, told the respondent that he had 60 days within which to take an action in the court if he were so minded.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.308" offset="949750">He chose not to.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.776" offset="959572">Instead, after seven years he brought the second round of proceedings before the Social Security Administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.416" offset="998128">These embrace the period March 1973 to mid 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.221" offset="1021430">In that period, he once again had initial consideration of the claim which he made.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.230" offset="1045462">He received reconsideration of that client.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.692" offset="1059255">He then asked for a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge, the ALJ decided that he had not presented anything warranting a reopening of his claim, which was based upon the same disability benefits period as the earlier round had been.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.596" offset="1138876">That is to say, the respondent showed no entitlement subsequent to June 30, 1962.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.290" offset="1173671">Accordingly, on the basis of Res judicata the respondent having shown nothing new in the second round proceeding, the Administrative Law Judge rejected his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.966" offset="1228424">The respondent then appealed to the Appeals Council, and the Appeals Council affirmed the rejection on the second round.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.970" offset="1260398">This is the reopening round.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.787" offset="1271683">Following that rejection, the respondent moved in to the Federal Courts, now for the first time advised by Council.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.361" offset="1309926">In the Federal Courts, he claimed that under Section 205(g) of the Social Security Act, he was entitled to get the court review of the refusal of the Administrative Proceedings of the Secretary to reopen his claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.768" offset="1391532">The District Judge in the Northern District of Indiana dismissed his claim on the ground that Section 205(g) of the Social Security Act is not a proper jurisdictional footing for a request to review a claim to reopen.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.089" offset="1472825">He appealed, the Seventh Circuit dividing decided that although it was correct that Section 205(g) and the Social Security Act are not a proper jurisdictional footing for reviewing in the Federal Courts a denied reopening claim nevertheless under the Administrative Procedure Act there would be jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.915" offset="1572195">It was in that posture of the case that this Court granted the Government’s petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.447" offset="1602288">There are several points to notice about this brief historical narrative.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.811" offset="1623709">One is that although without counsel throughout the Administrative Proceedings, the respondent exercised a number of options pursuing vigorously as he was entitled to do and should have done, the opportunities which the law afforded him to get consideration, reconsideration, and review again and again.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.291" offset="1705629">He came back to the Administrative Process after a lapse of more than seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.564" offset="1730811">The Administrative Process has rules about such matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.795" offset="1755679">It allows a rejected claimant to come back within a year on virtually no new showing, and ask for reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.487" offset="1798416">Within four years, after the final decision denying his claim, he can come back, and if he shows good cause, he can get a reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.422" offset="1838226">Good cause usually goes to the evidence, new material evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.214" offset="1865394">After four years, he may still go back, at any time, the regulations say, but in that event, he is limited in his return to the administrative process for reopening.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.897" offset="1924117">He is limited to showing that there was error of a clerical sort or an error on the face of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.721" offset="1951389">It was the latter, sort of, evidence which the respondent in this case set up as the error involved, but the record does not say and we do not know to this date what the nature of that error in the evidence is.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.196" offset="2029338">The Government’s case here is simple, in two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.223" offset="2061417">It is that there is no jurisdiction bestowed on the Federal Courts by the Social Security Act to review a reopening denial and that there is no jurisdiction --</text>

            <label>Mr. Maurice Rosenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="616.753" offset="2567565">Yes I concede to Your Honor that the respondent can raise a new point of such beyond (ph) appeal to defend his result.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.211" offset="2601315">First is to the Social Security Act and specifically Section 205 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.986" offset="2632453">Our submission is that it precludes jurisdiction to review a denial of reopening of a disability claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.327" offset="2669861">The decision not to reopen does not come within the carefully drawn language of Section 205 (h) of the statute, and, if Your Honors please, I would like to call your attention to the specific language of Section 205 (h) since so much trends (ph) upon it, in this first argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.992" offset="2756483">On Page 2A of the Appendix to our brief, the Section 205 (a) appears in its three sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.247" offset="2793472">It is to the second and third sentence, I call your attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.772" offset="2811549">The second sentence says, “No findings of fact or decision of the Secretary shall be reviewed by any person, tribunal, or government agency except as herein provided.”</text>
            <text syncTime="692.347" offset="2869854">The third sentence says that, “No action against the United States, the Secretary, or any officer or employee thereon shall be brought under Section 41 of Title 28 to recover on any claim arising under this subchapter Title II of the Act.”</text>
            <text syncTime="709.285" offset="2937668">Section 205 (h) is a statute that precludes jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.720" offset="2963372">It talks in terms of non-reviewability of findings and decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.770" offset="2987614">It talks in terms of no actions being brought.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.717" offset="3003392">So, it is preclusive with the narrow exception that is specified.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.534" offset="3026693">That is, the herein provided the exception, and that herein provided exception takes us a page ahead to Section 205 (g) which this Court has said, is the only way of reviewing a decision of the Administrator under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.343" offset="3105897">Section 205 (g) in its relevant phrase says that, “Any individual after any final decision of the Secretary made after a hearing, may go into court to bring an action in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="767.050" offset="3168695">The rest of this section deals with the venue of the action, the time of the action within 60 days after a notice of the decision, the record which will be before the District Court, the Court's powers to remedy hereby the Administrator, the scope and standards of review that the Court will follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.172" offset="3273185">That is an integrated plan for a Court review of Social Security administrative decisions and it is precisely to that plan and that channel of court review that Section 205, by its preclusive language, points the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.838" offset="3355836">This Court had said that when the Administrator has made a decision, as said in Weinberger v. Salfi, whether a final decision or not a decision, when the Administrator or Secretary has made a decision, then 205 (g) gives the only avenue for access into the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.368" offset="3453952">If the Court please, I do not find in the Salfi decision or in the Eldridge decision any indication that those decisions were calculated to change that carefully wrote (ph) statutory plan, which is very well balanced and which brings about a harmonious relationship so far as the law should require between the Court’s power to review and the Administrator’s power to decide in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.729" offset="3583415">There is nothing certainly in the language of Section 205 (g) to suggest that a decision such as is before the Court in this case, a decision not to reopen, is a final decision made after a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.838" offset="3647885">Of course, it is made after a hearing in some chronological and temporal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.870" offset="3667947">But, it is made after a hearing in the sense that, that phrase occurs in Section 205 (g).</text>

            <text syncTime="910.261" offset="3741508">I believe that it would not be a final decision after a hearing, in the sense in which a final decision is used in that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.527" offset="3778602">It is my submission that the final decision after a hearing is intended to deal with the determination of the core and hard issues in the case, that is, a final decision made after a hearing on the merits when the merits of the case have been exposed and a decision finally made upon them.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.853" offset="3867941">There isn’t any liberalization of that language, if that is the term, in Salfi and Eldridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.576" offset="3894794">They did not rewrite Section 205 (g) which would be necessary to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="967.090" offset="3968878">This is an ordinary case, the application of standards by the Administrator to facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.269" offset="4001583">There is nothing extraordinary about this case and it would be absurd to suggest, I submit, that the respondent can carry an open-end statute of limitations, moved for a rehearing or reopening, and upon getting it, whether with or without a hearing, have a brand new period of time in which to go to court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1002.197" offset="4109312">Your contention and is of the phrase, final decision made after a hearing both limits the review on both sides, the person can not come in before that is handed down, but he can not come in a long time after it is handed down either.</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.570" offset="4178798">On this, Justice Rehnquist, my contention is substantially as you say, but I would point out that the language, a final decision made after a hearing, does refer to a hearing that is required by the statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.963" offset="4240342">The hearing on reopening is not a hearing that is required by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.258" offset="4257583">That is the hearing and that is the matter of grace (ph) with the Administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.351" offset="4273883">If the Administrator or if the Secretary chooses to give a hearing at that time that should not prolong the opportunity of the respondent to go in to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.088" offset="4312858">Otherwise, the whole idea of a 60-day limitation on entering into Court is defeated.</text>
