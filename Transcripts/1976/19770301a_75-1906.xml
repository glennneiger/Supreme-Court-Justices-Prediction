            <label>Ms. Lillian Zeisel Cohen</label>
            <text syncTime="41.745" offset="267503">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.947" offset="280250">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.073" offset="292789">The question presented by this case is whether a State Court criminal conviction should be set aside as fundamentally unfair, because the Trial Judge did not explain the issue of causation to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.646" offset="347019">The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit answered this question in the affirmative “on the limited and singular facts of this case”.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.882" offset="384009">The court held that in this case the jury may not have been aware that they had to decide the issue of causation and alternatively that if the jury was aware of this element the instruction was not detailed enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.504" offset="438448">Petitioner believes that the decision below is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.374" offset="454017">First, because the issue of causation was focused for the jury throughout the trial by the prosecution and by both defense lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.755" offset="487454">Second, because the record controverts respondent’s assumption that it would have been to his advantage to if had a detailed instruction on the issue of causation, and third, because the ultimate question that was decided by the court below and upon which its decision rests to wit whether the jury instruction was adequate was essentially a question of state law and not a matter for habeas corpus review.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.046" offset="592675">Respondent and his codefendant were convicted of the crime of murder in the second degree under a section of the New York Penal Law, which provides that a person is guilty of murder when under circumstances evincing a depraved indifference to human life.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.001" offset="652443">He recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person and thereby causes the death of another person.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.324" offset="697792">A defendant is reckless under New York Law when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that a particular result will occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.262" offset="749514">The facts in this case are essentially undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.496" offset="762471">On December 30, 1970 in the evening respondent Kibbe and his codefendant Roy Krall met a man named George Stafford in a bar in Rochester, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.181" offset="805207">At that point, Stafford had already been refused service in the bar, because he had had so much to drink.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.826" offset="827777">Kibbe and Krall agreed to give Stafford a ride home when Stafford indicated that he was afraid to drive his own car.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.937" offset="860273">The defendants later admitted that they had already formed the intent to take the money, which Stafford had been flashing in the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.796" offset="883679">First however, the three men went to two more bars, one of which refused Stafford service again.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.325" offset="913772">Kibbe and Krall then drove Stafford to a rural area outside of Rochester.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.113" offset="928923">They took his money.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.587" offset="934775">According to the defendants, Stafford lowered his trousers and took off his boots to show them that he had no more money.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.479" offset="966435">Stafford’s girlfriend testified at the trial however that in fact because of an injury to his leg he could not remove his right boot.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.041" offset="996632">However, Stafford’s state of undress is accounted for.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.439" offset="1014187">The fact is that he was left essentially undressed at the side of a two-lane unlit road, which was banked on both sides by snow.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.049" offset="1056714">The record establishes that it was four degrees outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.426" offset="1066223">Stafford was not wearing his jacket or his boots.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.766" offset="1079493">These were handed to him by respondent Kibbe with the advice that Stafford get inside so that he not freeze to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.234" offset="1121393">One essential fact remains, and that is that at this point Kibbe and Krall drove off leaving Stafford on the side of the road having fallen into a snow bank, and they took with them his eyeglasses.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.463" offset="1166324">Now there is no dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="283.499" offset="1234451">It is undisputed that there was an open gas station in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.952" offset="1248244">Krall in the statement he later gave to the police said that they left Stafford 75 feet away from this gas station.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.231" offset="1277397">The prosecution introduced physical evidence to show that in fact Stafford had been left a quarter mile away from the gas station.</text>

            <text syncTime="303.487" offset="1314386">And not only was it on the other side of the road but Kibbe and Krall both acknowledged that they knew this.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.234" offset="1333403">So, when they told him to get inside some place, and they knew that the gas station was on the other side of the road, they realized he had to cross the road.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.231" offset="1361406">Moreover, Krall acknowledged, at least Krall acknowledged that there was in fact at that time on the road traffic going in both directions.</text>

            <text syncTime="679.609" offset="2818935">So that they did not take an objection at the time of the charge and as I indicated we believe there are two possible explanations for their decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.119" offset="2852998">The first is that they were satisfied that the issue of causation had been focused for the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.850" offset="2871911">The second is that they realized that under New York Law, an explicit charge on causation would have effectively deprived them of the opportunity of arguing to the jury that it was the negligence of the driver that was to blame, and in that way attempting to sway the jury away from the responsibility of the defendants.</text>

            <text syncTime="743.032" offset="3072636">This was hammered out constantly, and that was hammered up by the prosecution to show responsibility, and it was disputed by the defense who said it simply was not foreseeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.229" offset="3125403">With respect to counsel’s likely satisfaction that the issue was properly before the jury, I point to the statement by counsel for Krall who even before the charge to the jury said in summation, “You probably have the accounts well in mind since we have all gone over it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="772.631" offset="3191023">Now at that point, in the trial, the indictment had been read to the jury by Kibbe’s counsel in summation.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.412" offset="3218086">It had been outlined by the District Attorney in his opening.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.396" offset="3230102">The record indicates that it was read to the jury during the voir dire as each new panel was brought in.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.180" offset="3253194">Thereafter, Krall’s attorney proceeded to read the indictment to the jury, and the Judge at the beginning of his charge read the indictment to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.457" offset="3282347">The Judge also read the provisions of the statute after emphasizing that every element of the crime had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and ultimately while the jury was deliberating the indictment was given to them so that they could track the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.274" offset="3337622">Despite these repeated statements of the law to the jury and despite the fact the causation was argued so graphically to the jury by both defense counsels, the court below questioned whether the jury was aware that it had to decide the issue of causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.948" offset="3404286">This conclusion in my opinion cannot be sustained on the record in this case, and we believe that the explanation for the court's speculation that the jury may not have been aware of this issue, which was the focus of the trial was it is failure to make an analysis of this trial as mandated by this Court in Cupp against Naughten.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.179" offset="3481191">In Cupp, this Court specifically reaffirmed what it called a fundamental principle that a single jury instruction may not be evaluated only in the context of the overall charge, but in the context of the entire trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="859.093" offset="3536884">No, the Court used the words, "fundamental principle", it took it as a given, and in doing so emphasized the relevance of the witness’s testimony and the relevance of the arguments of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.675" offset="3579202">In the instant case, and so far as this Court below acknowledged these factors, they did it in a footnote considering the fact that this is supposed to be an alternate holding in the case, and they discounted them in much the same way that they discounted the relevance of reading the statute and reading the indictment to the jury, that is, they lifted each of these factors out of the context of the trial, and they examined them one by one, and they rejected them, instead of making the overall evaluation, which Cupp requires of whether or not the trial as a whole was fundamentally fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.317" offset="3697694">Now, respondent attempts to distinguish Cupp on the grounds that the alleged error there was corrected within the confines of the charge itself, and there was no recourse to the other events of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.140" offset="3748998">To me, this argument highlights the real distinction between Cupp and this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.395" offset="3770105">Cupp involved a challenge to an affirmative instruction to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.343" offset="3789854">The jury was told there that it should find that the prosecution’s witnesses had told the truth unless the presumption of truthfulness was overcome.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.199" offset="3837292">Therefore in Cupp it became necessary to determine whether anything in the remainder of the charge offset the impact on the minds of the jury of that directive by the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.551" offset="3882641">The Instein (ph) case is quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.542" offset="3890686">The charge to the jury in the Instein (ph) case was perfectly adequate as far as it went, and in fact the court below characterized much of the charge scrupulous.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.460" offset="3930288">We believe that because the trial judge did not affirmatively mislead the jury, did not affirmatively say anything to them, which had to be erased from their minds.</text>

            <text syncTime="992.636" offset="4071036">Before the recess I was addressing respondent’s contention that Cupp against Naughten was simply a case involving a self-correcting instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.234" offset="4113459">Petitioner believes that this argument ignores the analysis that was endorsed by the Court in Cupp without I might add denying its validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.505" offset="4146477">In fact because Cupp involved a challenge to an affirmative instruction to the jury whereas this case involves an omission, resort to what happened during the remainder of the trial becomes even more germane.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.327" offset="4201752">Because the Trial Judge in this case did not affirmatively misadvised the jury or mislead the jury, there was nothing which had to be erased from the minds of the jurors or as respondent says, neutralized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1038.794" offset="4255669">There was no infection of the rest of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.044" offset="4264655">The rest of the trial was perfectly adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1043.492" offset="4274477">Therefore, the question is simply, whether the record as a whole shows that the gap in the charge was effectively filled by the events at trial, an approach which is consistent not only with Cupp but which is consistent with the approach used in all habeas corpus review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.691" offset="4347202">In addition to its failure to properly apply Cupp the Circuit Court in its evaluation of this State Court instruction also failed to credit factors upon which it has relied in its own cases to sustain its own federal convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.359" offset="4409896">In a series of cases of which the best example is United States against Papa, in 533 F.2d. The court below, sustained federal narcotics conspiracy convictions despite the failure in each of those cases, on the part of the Trial Judge to charge the element of knowledge to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.071" offset="4488786">In each instance, the Circuit Court determined that the jury was aware of the missing element, because the District Judge had read to the jury both the statute and the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.814" offset="4535702">In Papa it was done repeatedly as it was done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.961" offset="4552316">It is clear therefore that by refusing to give due weight to the same factors that it has relied upon in reviewing its own convictions, the court below was effectively holding this State Court Trial Judge to a higher standard than it has held its own District Judges.</text>
