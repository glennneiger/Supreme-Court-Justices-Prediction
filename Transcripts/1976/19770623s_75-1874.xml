            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100554">In the second of these two cases, Number 75-1874, Jones versus North Carolina Prisoners' Union, the appellants who are North Carolina Correctional Officials promulgated regulations which barred meetings inside the prison of the various North Carolina Institutions of such as those of appellee which is the North Carolina Prisoners Union, Inc., in which prohibited inmates from soliciting other inmates to join the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.035" offset="224688">Appellants also refused to deliver bulk mail packages of union publications which had been mailed to inmates for redistribution to other inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.649" offset="271081">The Union filed this action challenging these regulations in the United States District of the -- in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.112" offset="300965">If claimed that efforts to prevent the operation of the Prisoners' Union violated the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of it and its members, and the fact that the Jaycees and Alcoholics Anonymous were granted rights denied to it, deprived it of equal protection of the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.977" offset="376407">A three-judge District Court in North Carolina substantially agreed with the -- these contentions in order that the Prisoners' Union be given meeting and other rights accorded to other inmate organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.990" offset="424472">For the reason set forth and an opinion which have been filed with the clerk this morning, we reversed the judgement of the three-judge District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.677" offset="451222">We concluded that the District Court did not give sufficient deference to the decisions of the Prison Administrators and to the peculiar and restrictive circumstances of penal confinement.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.783" offset="491659">The prison officials viewed the operation of a functioning prison union to be potentially dangerous and they have not been shown to be wrong in these apprehensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.883" offset="528022">We do not view the speech, Union's speech and associational claims or its equal protection claim as justifying a different result.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.732" offset="559473">These rights must give way to the reasonable considerations of penal management among which internal security considerations necessarily loom large.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.404" offset="598134">The Chief Justice has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.401" offset="610151">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.326" offset="629795">Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion in which Mr Justice Brennan has joined.</text>
