            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100544">The judgment and opinion of the Court in No. 67 Original, Idaho against Oregon and Washington will be announced by Mr. Justice Rehnquist along with 78-990, United States against Bailey and United States against Cogdell.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="4.093" offset="116844">In the State of Idaho Original case, the State of Idaho has invoked this Court's original jurisdiction in a suit against the States of Oregon and Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="6.293" offset="125622">Idaho seeks equitable apportionment of various runs of anadromous fish migrating from the Pacific Ocean to Idaho by way of the Columbia and Snake River.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.637" offset="135026">According to Idaho fishermen in Oregon and Washington which are located downstream from Idaho are taking more than their fair share of fish that would otherwise return to Idaho to spawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.442" offset="146311">We referred the case to a Special Master who has recommended that Idaho’s complaint be dismissed because the United States government was not a party to the suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.691" offset="155297">The Special Master believes that the United States was a necessary party because it regulated fishing in the Pacific Ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="15.069" offset="160730">Because it controlled the dams over which the migrating fish must pass on their way to Idaho and because it acts as trustee for various tribes of Indians who also are entitled to a portion of the fish. Contrary to the Special Master’s recommendation, we hold that this suit can proceed even if the United States is not a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.573" offset="178807">Neither the government’s regulation of the ocean fishery not its control of the dams would prevent this Court from allocating to Idaho a portion of those fish now being taken by non-Indian fishermen in Oregon and Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.448" offset="190301">Nor would the Indian’s right to take fish necessarily affect or be affected by the narrowly drawn decrees sought by Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.427" offset="198242">We therefore sustain Idaho’s exceptions to the Special Master’s report and remand the case to him for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.140" offset="205034">Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Marshall dissent.</text>
