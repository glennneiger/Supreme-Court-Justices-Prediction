            <text syncTime="12.233" offset="149448">This school desegregation case was initially filed in 1972 by parents of Black children attending schools operating -- operated by the Dayton, Ohio Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.204" offset="205350">The District Court for the Southern District of Ohio found that there was substantial racial imbalance among the schools of the district.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.808" offset="239727">And that in at least two instances, the Board continued to employ optional attendance zones having a tendency to aggravate the racial imbalance and that the Board had rescinded resolutions of a predecessor Board which it acknowledge responsibility for the racially imbalance condition of the schools stating that these three facts are cumulatively a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.962" offset="348292">The District Court concluded that a remedial desegregation plan was constitutionally required.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.011" offset="376505">On three separate occasions, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reviewed remedial plans promulgated by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.446" offset="410255">The Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's findings of fact but on the first two occasions, reversed the District Court plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.132" offset="445050">The third plan adopted by the District Court employed system wide transportation of pupils as a means of achieving racial balance and that plan was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.320" offset="489771">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we vacate the opinion of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.929" offset="512237">The facts found below that constitute an equal protection violation are a very limited significance and do not support the broad system wide remedy finally adopted by the District Court only after it's repeated reversals by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.822" offset="575767">The plan finally approved by the Court of Appeals does not comply with well-established principles of our cases that the remedy must be tailored to the constitutional violations found.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.558" offset="622683">Only if there is a system wide violation is a system wide remedy warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.727" offset="647447">The case is remanded to the District Court for further findings of fact and for promulgation of a plan tailored to remedying any constitutional violations found.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.907" offset="688093">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.388" offset="702095">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.256" offset="717559">Mr. Justice Marshall took no part in the consideration or decision of this case</text>
