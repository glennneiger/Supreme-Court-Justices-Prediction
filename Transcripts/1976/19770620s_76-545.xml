            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100543">The second case in which I am authorized to announce the opinion and judgment of the Court this morning is United Airlines, Incorporated against Liane Buix McDonald, Number 76-545, the case which is hereby way of the grant of a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.874" offset="195942">Rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure requires that an application to intervene in federal litigation must be timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.183" offset="237216">In this case, a motion to intervene was filed promptly after the final judgment of a District Court for the purpose of appealing the Court's earlier denial of class action certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.992" offset="284445">The question presented is whether this motion was timely under Rule 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.914" offset="308164">The suit was originally brought as a class action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.179" offset="337212">It attacked the now abrogated policy of United Airlines requiring its female flight attendants to remain unmarried as a condition of their continued employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.904" offset="388099">The respondent, a former United Airlines stewardess, was an unnamed member of the putative class. During the course of the litigation, the District Court stripped the case of its character as a class action and ultimately granted relief to the named plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.943" offset="464272">During the time allowed for an appeal for the final judgment, the respondent moved to intervene in the District Court for the sole purpose of appealing the Court's earlier order denying class action status.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.903" offset="516099">The District Court held that this motion came too late, but the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.172" offset="545147">We now affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the reason set out in a written opinion of the Court filed today with the clerk.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.140" offset="577016">We hold that in the circumstances of this case, the respondent's motion to intervene was a timely one under Rule 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.176" offset="613170">Mr. Justice Powell has filed a dissenting opinion which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice White have joined and Mr. Justice Stevens took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</text>
