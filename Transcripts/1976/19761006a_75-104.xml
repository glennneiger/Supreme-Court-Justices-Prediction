            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="145.478" offset="682987">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.913" offset="700645">The constitutional issue presented by this case which is here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is whether a legislative apportionment which deliberately limits the white population of certain assembly and senate districts for New York State to not more than 35% of the total number of citizens in each of those districts is consistent with Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.902" offset="816629">A majority of the court below, two judges, said that our argument that such districting is unconstitutional has “intellectual appeal on the surface”, and even the Solicitor General in his brief says that our contention has “considerable superficial appeal”.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.953" offset="904819">Each then proceeds with an involved effort to justify what was done here by the New York Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.053" offset="941285">In each case, we submit the effort simply fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.741" offset="956019">We believe that the instinctive response to this set of facts, the simple reaction that such a districting scheme cannot be correct and cannot be constitutionally valid is the proper result, and that the contrary view is not what Congress contemplated in the Voting Rights Act and not what is contemplated by the Fifteenth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="237.357" offset="1050477">Mr. Lewin, in you opening statement you said deliberately.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.669" offset="1067718">What do you mean by way of intent or knowledge or that sort of thing by the use of that adverb?</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="247.458" offset="1090915">By the use of that adverb, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, I mean that the individuals drawing that line had that as the primary and dominant criterion in their mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.649" offset="1139607">They said not the result of what we have done is by happen stands or because it is one of many factors to produce a not more than 35% white citizenry in that district, but that is what we are going to achieve, that is what we intent to achieve.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.682" offset="1211810">Districts that will have not more than 35% whites in them, and that is what I mean by deliberate.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.614" offset="1235529">I think more so than any other that has previously been before this Court where allegations of racial gerrymandering have been made, the record in this case is undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.661" offset="1275653">I think there is really no question about the fact that the individual responsible for drawing the lines did it for that reason, and I would say, almost that reason only, that is why the line was drawn.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="304.552" offset="1319225">But if we adopt your principle, then I suppose in all future cases like this the committee chairman, perhaps the legislators themselves, could be examined on depositions as to what their primary motive was when they voted this or whey they sat on committee and decided to recommend this.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="324.027" stopTime="405.103">
            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="324.027" offset="1397174">I think in the ordinary case Mr. Justice Rehnquist, there is a lot of difficulty in determining what such a motive is, that is why this Court has prevented interrogations or investigations of legislative motive, because there is a variety of motives that combine to produce a particular result, and there is really no way to knowing what a legislature has done, but in this case, there is just no question.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.426" offset="1478781">Where, in the unique cases as this one is, where the legislative purpose is set out and is stated in the legislative record, and is not disputed, we believe it is entirely proper for the Court to say, may a legislature do this, is it permissible for a legislature to act in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.565" offset="1547326">We think on that account that our claim is really quite different from what the white respondents would like to characterize our claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.995" offset="1580972">Both the Solicitor General and the NAACP, which is intervener in this case in its brief, have been asserting I think throughout that our contention is that legislators may not take account in some way that legislators of course do in the real world of what the racial distribution is of districts which result from apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.891" offset="1664564">We are not saying that they may not review a Census maturity when others know what is happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.799" offset="1688179">What our argument is, is that that may not the criterion, the principle standard and guideline that they are using.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.893" offset="1780652">If you lay down a principle, as you say in this case, that were the primary factor that they considered was what you have outlined.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.971" offset="1816910">In any future case, on the basis of normal rules of evidence, you are going to open up to prove on the part of the plaintiffs the issue of whether or not this or that was the primary in fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="444.747" offset="1880022">I must say Mr. Justice Rehnquist, it seems to me that the courts can setup a threshold which you have to meet with the preliminary showing before you can engage in such an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.718" offset="1919937">I do not think we are suggesting that it would be open for any plaintiff and come in and say, I will put the entire legislature on the stand and interrogate them as to their motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.650" offset="1955672">In this case we have I think from the legislative report itself from the undisputed history of how this apportionment developed the necessary inference that any court and indeed the defendants I think admitted as much in their answer.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="477.487" offset="2010947">Now, you do not need to go beyond the proposition that where it appears on the face of the legislative record that this was the purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.866" offset="2048459">Would that take care of the subjective problem that Mr. Justice Rehnquist raises?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="492.074" stopTime="538.420">
            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="492.074" offset="2069357">Yes, I think it would Mr. Chief Justice and we would accept that test certainly that where it appears on the face of the reports on the legislative record that that is what the legislature is doing then it is impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.762" offset="2108123">And then maybe the burden falls on the other side which was represented in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.027" offset="2133096">I mean that is one of the reasons really that we filed this suit against the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.089" offset="2149396">We are here being challenged in this Court over the fact that the Attorney General is a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.423" offset="2166742">Well, one of the reasons why the suit was filed against the Attorney General was precisely to afford all parties an opportunity to come in and explain whether there was any justification for this and there was no justification for this apportionment and no justification for what preceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.808" offset="2220241">And that is why the record comes to this Court in its present state, where the facts are undisputed and lead invariably to that one conclusion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="538.420" stopTime="552.563">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="538.420" offset="2254722">But couldn’t you have intervened in the action by the State against the Attorney General when the State was challenging the Attorney General’s rather amorphous reaction to its districting plan?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="nathan_lewin" startTime="552.563" stopTime="640.761">
            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="552.563" offset="2311251">There are two reasons why we could not do that: One is that unfortunately the State, because of the exigencies of time, never challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.339" offset="2334343">They never took it to court, and when several legislators who were dissatisfied with what the Attorney General had done, had instituted a suit in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.651" offset="2367676">It was dismissed for the lack of standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.654" offset="2375617">But the second more important reason really is that we did not know, my clients did not know what the product was going to be of the Attorney General’s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.101" offset="2409472">It was not until the New York State Assembly sat down in several very frenzy days in May and determined that they were going to draw the line in these legislative districts in such a manner that this community will split in half between two districts that we even knew what had happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.469" offset="2474882">That we even knew that there was anything to complain about.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.157" offset="2485645">We would, simply along with all other citizens of New York, possibly or many of the citizens of New York have supported the 72 reapportionment, but until the 74 reapportionment was enacted we just did not know what it was going to do to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.546" offset="2547189">Let me just briefly then describe what exactly happened with these apportionment and then proceed to outline the relationship between the 74 apportionment and the prior Attorney General’s decision under the Voting Rights Act, relations that is important both to our position and to that of the respondents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1465.120" offset="5961498">I wonder if the existence of Section 5 has anything at all really changes the issue at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.956" offset="5980828">The question I have asked is, supposing the New York Legislature, independently of Section 5, had concluded that there was undue concentration of voters of one particular race in an area, could they for their own, just to correct that situation, had done what they say they are more or less compelled to do by the United States here, and would that be a different case than this?</text>

            <text syncTime="1490.410" offset="6062644">Our view is that they certainly could not that if that were true then the argument that the respondents made based Gaffney and Cummings would be somewhat closer to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.326" offset="6114366">One distinction that we think exists between this case and this Court’s opinion in Gaffney is that Gaffney was a determined legislative judgment to apportion in a certain manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.383" offset="6158565">This Court said it will not strike that down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1517.642" offset="6171627">Now, Of course we will argue that Gaffney is distinguishable because Gaffney was apportionment based on political ideology rather than race, but if race were the factor, we think that would be impermissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.582" offset="6215408">As a matter of fact, we think that Your Honor’s opinion dissenting in the Cousin’s case, in 466 F. 2d. we think does demonstrate precisely that that is impressible not only with regard to blacks, but with regard to other minorities, with regard to this white community of Williamsburgh, which was and is a racial minority in the district where it resides.</text>

            <text syncTime="1567.322" offset="6370366">Over the luncheon recess I have done my homework Mr. Justice Brennan, and read Washington versus Davis which it appears to me does affect this case in one major way, and in another subsidiary way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.632" offset="6443509">The Court did hold of course in Washington versus Davis that all statistical proof goes to the ultimate question of whether there has been purposeful discrimination and that that is the constitutional text.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.321" offset="6506307">It would appear to me that the decision in Washington and Davis and the opinion is consistent in that regard with our position that it is really not necessary for the Court to consider the statistical impact of any particular apportionment if the record is as clear as it is here on there being a discriminatory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.393" offset="6606618">In fact, at the end of the Court’s opinion in the City of Richmond case as well, the Court adverted in that opinion to the fact that even perfectly legal results, even statistics which would stand analysis if examined to see what their effect would be on racial minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.666" offset="6691672">It would be impressible, if they are done for racially discriminatory purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.511" offset="6723124">The Court viewed a racially discriminatory purpose as being as it put it, a gross racial slur which can have no credentials whatever, and in that regard quoted from a 1918 opinion that “acts generally lawful may become unlawful when done to accomplish an unlawful end.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2758.346" offset="11134370">Together with my colleagues, Mr. Greenberg and Schnapper, I represent the NAACP which intervened in the District Court in this case to oppose petitioners’ claim, the lines adopted by the New York Legislature in 1974 to delineate the assembly and the senate districts in the County of Brooklyn unconstitutionally abridge the franchised petitioners and other white residents in that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.081" offset="11233321">In the short time available to me I will attempt to advance two linked propositions, namely that the 1974 lines are constitutionally proper both as to purpose and as to effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.878" offset="11280551">But before advancing these propositions I will with the Court’s permission try to address a few preliminary words to two critical aspects of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.247" offset="11318063">First it has to do with the anomalous nature of the petitioners’ constitutional claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.237" offset="11338020">The second goes to peculiar procedural posture of this case, the case which comes here, if the Court please, not after a full trial, but after a very brief hearing on petitioners’ motion for preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.376" offset="11390579">I submit a far too truncated record to begin to sustain petitioners’ extraordinary claim of proof that the State of New York and the Attorney General of the United States have collaborated to abridge petitioners’ constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2836.429" offset="11446794">Now in saying that petitioners’ claim is anomalous I have in mind two aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.102" offset="11473439">To the extent that petitioners are in effect asserting a constitutional entitlement to have their Hasidic community remains forever in a single voting district.</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.985" offset="13076939">Perhaps it bares remembering that the New York Legislature was not simply attempting as Mr. Lewin seems to have suggested to address itself to that particular purpose of disenfranchising his clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.959" offset="13128871">It was required under the New York Constitution to redistrict the State following the 1970 Census.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.003" offset="13165024">The 1972 lines disapproved to address to that purpose, the 1974 lines were replaced the disapproved 1972 lines, and the meeting of the objections of the Attorney General of the United States with respect to particular disadvantage in noncompliance for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as it applied to Brooklyn was simply one of the modest purposes of the legislature of the State of New York but that was a purpose which was addressed to the County of Brooklyn as such because it was that county which I submit the Attorney General was directing New York’s attention to in disapproving the 1972 lines.</text>

            <text syncTime="3976.615" offset="16007460">I have been liking in the brief time available to concentrate upon the merits of petitioners’ claim and leave the question of Attorney General’s position as a party in this case to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3984.898" offset="16040583">I think the question of the claim under the Voting Rights Act which is made and the compliant is also taking care of the brief, has not been pretty clarified that there is no claim made -- that there is discrimination against the Hasidism as such.</text>

            <text syncTime="4000.453" offset="16102859">What is the government’s interest in the merits of the plaintiff’s constitutional claim if the status of the Attorney General as a party has put to one side?</text>

            <text syncTime="4009.236" offset="16137968">The government’s interest become then Mr. Justice Rehnquist preserving the Voting Rights Act of 1965, from a ruling which I think would effectively destroy its application to apportionment.</text>
            <text syncTime="4022.872" offset="16192512">The case turns upon the petitioners’ claim as members of the white race, and I think I can show rather quickly that analysis demonstrates that they have no valid claim of unconstitutional discrimination on the basis of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="4034.836" offset="16240368">For purposes of clarity, I would like to discuss first the general constitutional issue, and second I will examine the question of whether the Attorney General’s involvement, in the facts, in the redistricting process, alters that conclusion in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4050.704" offset="16303898">Our petitioners’ central contention appears to be that redistricting may not be done, so as to produce any particular racial composition in the voting district, and I think acceptance of that contention would have two results, each of which is completely foreclosed by constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.969" offset="16376936">The first would be the effective destruction of the application of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act to reapportionments.</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.415" offset="16402641">The second which seems to me equally bizarre, would be that districting itself would be made unconstitutional, unless done by a person who could be proved to have no idea of the ethnic or racial composition of the community it was dealing with or preferably done by a computer which was not programmed to have any such information.</text>

            <text syncTime="4120.727" offset="16583930">I think that is true Mr. Chief Justice, but that is why I say that acceptance of their argument I think -- for the reason I say is, you cannot do redistricting without having racial considerations in mind, unless you are willing to forget about the Voting Rights Act of 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.282" offset="16670134">It is impossible to be sure that there is not effect of abridging anybody’s voting right on account of his race, of a racial group there has not been retrogression, unless the persons who draw the district lines knows the impact, they are having upon a racial group.</text>
            <text syncTime="4158.292" offset="16734187">Now, there has been great play here upon the word ‘quotas’.</text>
            <text syncTime="4161.099" offset="16745472">It is a word I do not greatly care for in most contexts, but it must be said that the Fifteenth Amendment implemented by the Voting Rights Act, and under either the majority or the minority position in Beer, somebody has to decide whether a racial group has been dropped below a certain position in a voting district.</text>
            <text syncTime="4184.341" offset="16838363">Now, Mr. Lewin can call it a quota if he wants to and get whatever emotional connotations that are in that word, but that happens to be the result of the Fifteenth Amendment as it worked out to date.</text>
            <text syncTime="4198.386" offset="16894579">Thus, it seems to me that petitioners’ claim is necessarily that the Voting Rights Act itself is unconstitutional and that claim has been decisively rejected by this Court, beginning with South Carolina against Katzenbach.</text>
            <text syncTime="4212.095" offset="16949436">Let me say one other thing, the petitioners I think have confused here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4216.446" offset="16966781">The 1972 plan devised by the State of New York served many purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.880" offset="16996561">The redistricting, as it always does, served many purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.494" offset="17010980">It was revised after the Attorney General objected in one area to its racial impact, and only the revision had a racial purpose to it, but other purposes were continued to be served by the redistricting, so it is not true that this is a districting which is entirely racial in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4247.142" offset="17089556">If we are going to litigate every modification of the plan made under by legislature, it will be endless, but petitioners’ argument is worse than destroying the Voting Rights Act, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="4257.709" offset="17131875">They really think that any redistricting of New York by its legislature would be unconstitutional, for it is perfectly clear that politicians are aware of the racial and ethnic makeup of neighborhoods, not only of their own constituencies, but of other constituencies, and it is perfectly clear that how the lines are drawn is going to affect the outcome of elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="4276.901" offset="17208675">To tell a politician who knows that that he must not think about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4281.536" offset="17227170">It is about as telling a lawyer he must not think about which argument he is likely to declare on the court when he has a case to try.</text>
            <text syncTime="4287.642" offset="17251620">It is about as effective of telling somebody for the next three seconds he must not think about the word hippopotamus.</text>
            <text syncTime="4295.725" offset="17283907">I waited three seconds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4299.473" offset="17298954">That means, the petitioners’ constitutional theory cannot be carried out unless the function of redistricting has taken away from legislatures all together, and can sign the courts or the computers, which is not what the Constitution requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="4314.072" offset="17357364">The Gaffney against Cummings says, the apportionment task dealing as it must, with fundamental choices about the nature of representation is primarily a political and legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4325.592" offset="17403444">I think those two points, the petitioners’ arguments requires both the unconstitutionality, the Voting Rights Act as applied to apportionment and the unconstitutionality of districting done by legislatures are enough to dispose off this case, but I want to deal with a suggestion made, that somehow this case does not involve such a result, because it is unique and it is unique because the Attorney General is involved in the case, in the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4350.938" offset="17504799">That factor does not already analysis one with.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.685" offset="17519741">I will put petitioners’ basic contention on this Court as strongly as I can, in order to show that there is nothing to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4362.212" offset="17549834">The argument runs that the Attorney General disapproved of the 1972 plan and in the process of discussion with members of the Department afterwards, the staff assistant from New York got the idea, he was not told, he got the idea indirectly that it has come up with a 65% minimum proportion of nonwhites in order to get the approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.722" offset="17655891">Now, it is said also that the Attorney General’s refusal to approve the 1972 plan was subsequently shown to be wrong by this Court’s Beer decision, because proportional representation is not required for the Act and the State was thus forced into a position of redistricting in a way it would not otherwise have chosen.</text>
            <text syncTime="4406.462" offset="17726840">That as I said, requires reversal of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="4410.462" offset="17742931">I think it does not -- Like there are two answers to that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4414.797" offset="17760172">The first and less important perhaps, is that the Attorney General could not and did not compel the 1974 plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4425.461" offset="17802908">He did not require it, New York could have tried to convince him that the proper test was whether the 1972 plan was a (Inaudible) or retrogressive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4435.695" offset="17843764">They did not try to convince of that, they did not present him with evidence from which he could have made that determination.</text>

            <text syncTime="4486.928" offset="18048773">I will accept that for purposes of argument, I think it makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="4491.366" offset="18066536">I say that for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="4493.401" offset="18074686">There was nothing whatsoever improper about the Attorney General’s involvement in this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="4499.928" offset="18100704">There are some overtones of that in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="4502.922" offset="18112721">The fact is that the Fifteenth Amendment permanently shifted federal state balance in this particular area, and the Voting Rights Act, which implements Fifteenth Amendment, puts the Attorney General into the redistricting process, when a covered jurisdiction comes to him rather than going to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="4521.080" offset="18185341">In that sense, in that constitutional sense, the Attorney General is as much a part of this process with a different role to play, but a part of this process legitimately as he is the legislature of the State of New York, as he is the Governor of New York or anybody else who plays a part in it.</text>

            <text syncTime="4639.715" offset="18659934">Of course, if there is no black racial voting or very little, the problem becomes much less.</text>
            <text syncTime="4647.988" offset="18692952">But the other part of this matter is; it is suggested that the Attorney General made a mistake when he refused to approve the 1972 plan, because he was using the theory that the minority of this Court took in Beer, and he should have been taking the position that the majority took.</text>
            <text syncTime="4666.395" offset="18766618">Of course, this was before Beer was decided and the Attorney General was acting in the light of the Lower Court’s decision to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="4672.949" offset="18792845">But the Attorney General must often decide before an issue is clarified by law and is no different than if New York had gone to the Three-Judge Court and got an erroneous decision, which he did not appeal or if the legislature had made a mistake of law and put in a plan that did not have to under the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4689.828" offset="18860345">It is no different then if the Governor with a mistaken view of what this Court would ultimately say about the Voting Rights Act had kept vetoing legislation by the legislature, until he forced them to the 1974 plan or some analogous plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="4705.156" offset="18921681">So, that in all of these cases the issue is not whether somebody who is legitimately in the process as the Attorney General most certainly was, may have made a miscalculation about the future course of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="4716.930" offset="18968701">The question in all of these hypothesize cases, as on in this case is, whether the resulting redistricting violated the constitutional right and it seems to me that this case must be analyzed just as if there were no Voting Rights Act and just as if there were no Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="4732.768" offset="19032126">That means it comes down to the question of whether a State or Local Government can take race into account and choose to redistrict, so that there is racial proportional representation from an area.</text>
            <text syncTime="4745.315" offset="19082281">That maybe a good idea or it maybe a bad idea, but I think that’s a legislative question, because I don’t think there is a slightest doubt that as a constitutional matter, a state can do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="5000.793" offset="20104192">There is no dispute that the State of New York utilized racial statistics enjoying the 1974 redistricting plan that is challenged by petitioners, but it is also clear that the use of racial consideration, so the preparation of 1974 plan was not for any invidious discriminatory purpose, but was designed as a remedial measure to overcome the objections that the Attorney General of the United States had raised in refusing to approve New York’s 1972 reapportionment statute with respect to New York and Kings County.</text>

            <text syncTime="5050.388" offset="20302618">I think any fair response or reasonable in terms of proportionality, but if you reach Gomillion situation then I think it could be fairly attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="5064.728" offset="20359983">The State of New York does not agree with the April 1, 1974 determination of the Department of Justice which we rejected New York’s 1972 lines, and indeed the State believes that the recent decision of this Court in Beer versus the United States clearly indicates that that determination of the Department of Justice was based on an erroneous application of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="5088.281" offset="20454128">However, the fact remains that due to the pressures of time brought on by the imminence of the 1974 primary, the State chose not to challenge the Justice Department’s determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="5101.467" offset="20506895">As such the State was required to enact new legislation immediately to satisfy the objections of the Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="5110.663" offset="20543676">Now, in attempting to satisfy these objections, it maybe remembered that the Department of Justice had complained that the 1972 districts contained an over concentration of nonwhites in the 18th senate district and in the 53rd to 56th assembly districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="5127.259" offset="20610027">So to overcome these objections it was obviously necessary for the State to consider the racial composition of individual city blocks to transfer nonwhite voters from these allegedly over concentrated districts into the adjoining districts of allegedly under concentrated minority voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="5148.111" offset="20693514">While racial considerations are generally constitutionally suspect, where such considerations have been taken in support of the remedial measure to further integration as was done in this case, the use of racial consideration has been sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="5164.044" offset="20757253">We point out at pages 19 and 20 of our brief, many of the cases in which the conscious use of racial considerations by public officials has been sustained when taken through further integration in the areas of education and employments and in promoting integrated housing.</text>

            <text syncTime="5327.213" offset="21409896">In the appendix to our brief, we have included maps of the black and Puerto Rican population in Kings Counties and it will be noted that the black population is concentrated in the interior of Kings County and to a lesser extent so as the Puerto Rican population.</text>
            <text syncTime="5348.004" offset="21493070">The southern half of Kings County is almost completely barren of blacks and Puerto Ricans.</text>
            <text syncTime="5354.815" offset="21520342">Therefore, it would be possible applying a colorblind approach to draw equal districts starting at the peripheries of the County and working towards the center which would produce a result in which minorities would have far fewer districts than there are population would have appeared to entitle them too.</text>
            <text syncTime="5373.425" offset="21594739">We submit that in attempt to prevent this unintended discriminatory effect the State may consider racial considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5386.617" offset="21647506">Now, we believe the basic flaw in the petitioners’ approach is that they can point to no injury of constitutional dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="5394.998" offset="21681047">While we can appreciate their desire as a closely knit religious group to be confined within a single assembly or senate district, there is no constitutional right for ethnic or religious groups to be included within an electoral district that is favorable to the injuries of their group.</text>
            <text syncTime="5411.504" offset="21747085">Obviously in Kings County with all the many multiethnic and racial and religious groups it would be impossible to satisfy all their demands and still to draw districts that were of equal population to satisfy the one person, one vote constitutional requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5430.471" offset="21822944">Finally, even as white voters, we believe they have failed to show any constitutional injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="5435.785" offset="21844156">Since whites with approximately 65% of the population in Kings County are in a majority in 68.6% of the assembly districts and 70% of the senate districts.</text>

            <label>Mr. Nathan Lewin</label>
            <text syncTime="5458.261" offset="21934121">I might just take almost just one three points I think that came up Mr. Chief Justice in the course of the respondents’ argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5464.845" offset="21960453">First on, rereading the NAACP’s brief and its Footnote, I have to apologize to the Court, I did misunderstand the word succeeding election that appeared in that brief, and read it to assume that there was an election since, which of course I should have realized there was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="5480.127" offset="22021579">In fact, therefore, the statement I made to the Court about the election of black candidates was in error and is not what the NAACP brief indicates, and I would just like to withdraw that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5491.268" offset="22066092">But I think those statistics do indicate that if the overwhelmingly nonwhite district had in fact voted the way the NAACP suggested, there would have been overwhelmingly disproportionate, I believe, black representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5506.765" offset="22128054">Let me make just a brief response to Mr. Pollak’s point regarding the inadequacy of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5515.291" offset="22162223">We made a motion for summary judgment below and our statement is to point as to which there is no genuine issue appears at 259 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="5522.885" offset="22192525">The State respondents did not put any of those questions in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="5526.527" offset="22207153">The NAACP put some of them in issue, but we think not those really that would dispose of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5531.644" offset="22227633">We believe our motion to summary judgment on the undisputed facts should have and could have been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="5536.762" offset="22248113">It is simply not true that this record in its present posture requires any remand for any further hearing if those points are read and if the complaint and the State answer which appears in the appendix are both read.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>

            <text syncTime="5551.832" offset="22308404">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5552.928" offset="22312792">We moved on the basis of the record made on the motion of preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="5556.214" offset="22325854">We moved thereafter for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5558.892" offset="22336616">There was a response to it filed by the NAACP, none to my recollection filed by the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="5564.007" offset="22357096">The Court denied the motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.294" offset="22366187">We appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="5566.997" offset="22369008">We asked as part of our appeal at the Court of Appeals grant our motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="5571.256" offset="22386040">The record is in posture where we think we are entitled to summary judgment based on the undisputed testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="5576.582" offset="22407356">At that hearing, where there was ample notice, it was not a hearing that was called without notice, I think there were several days, our witnesses had testified, they called no witnesses.</text>

            <text syncTime="5598.435" offset="22494814">Finally, I think the Solicitor General has very much overstated our position by saying that we urge that the Voting Rights Act be overruled and that race be ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="5606.890" offset="22528564">We made no such argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="5609.084" offset="22537341">We said clearly as in employment cases, it is proper for a state to look at race to decide what its apportionment has done.</text>
            <text syncTime="5616.088" offset="22565344">It is not proper to make race the criterion which is really, and it is clear from the legislative record, that was the standard that was used here by the New York Legislature.</text>
