            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="9.991" offset="140447">The petitioners in this case were the operators of a movie theater in Newport Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.774" offset="167614">They were charged with transporting obscene materials in the interstate commerce in violation of a federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.358" offset="197916">The alleged violation occurred in early 1973 before our decision in Miller against California.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.613" offset="230935">In Miller, we announced new standards by which to decide whether allegedly obscene materials are protected by the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.072" offset="268761">The instructions to the jury in this case were based on Miller rather than prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.719" offset="295405">Since the conduct had issue occurred before Miller, we think it was error to apply the Miller standards retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.691" offset="331245">We would not influence criminal liability if a conduct not punishable under the earlier standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.504" offset="358517">We therefore reverse the convictions and remand the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.001" offset="372519">Mr. Justice Brennan filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part in which Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Marshall joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.364" offset="405956">Mr. Justice Stevens also filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.</text>
