            <label>Mr. Jacob L. Safron</label>
            <text syncTime="55.362" offset="321935">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.013" offset="340534">This case is before this Court on the grant of a petition for the certiorari to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals to review similar claims brought by various North Carolina prisoners to the effect that by not providing them with legal research facilities, the State of North Carolina has denied their access to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.945" offset="440217">The District Court in its original opinion tracked the language of the Three-Judge Federal Court in California and Gilmore v. Lynch, and stated that the volumes available would provide meagre fare for a lawyer who is trained in his profession and even more meagre fare for an inmate who has no legal training to assist him in discerning how to file, what petitions, and what to include in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.022" offset="560590">The Court takes notice of more than mere facts are necessary in order to file petition for relief by a way of habeas corpus, for example.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.837" offset="599773">The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed in an opinion which is quite simplistic in its approach stating that the State of North Carolina has an obligation under the various cases to provide legal research facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.702" offset="755254">It is our argument and we submit that the District Court erred and at the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals erred in its conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.672" offset="803110">One, that extensive legal research facilities are required, and number two, that there is in fact a constitutional obligation as a primary obligation to provide these facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.719" offset="875313">Now, in support of this argument I would first like to point out that this Court has promulgated rules, which go into effect just about any day now, the new rules governing Section 2254 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.825" offset="947724">These rules go into affect pursuant to Public Law 94-349, 30 days after the recess of the 94th Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.855" offset="983878">Now, we take a look at these rules, we also take a look at the forms in those rules and the forms currently available in all of the United States District Courts to file habeas corpus proceedings for State Court prisoners in the District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.489" offset="1058379">I have here a typical sample which I am sure the Court is well aware, a fill in the blanks form available from any United States District Court Clerk, and the forms are quite clear that just set forth facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.408" offset="1122118">Now under the rules which go into effect any day now, the rules of this Court, utilizing the forms provided for in these rules. It states quite clearly, number one, in the instructions, in setting forth the grounds, supporting facts and the word ‘facts’ as prepared by this Court is in capital letters, supporting Facts (tell your story briefly without citing cases or law).</text>
            <text syncTime="292.789" offset="1271643">Now these are the forms for use in habeas corpus which any day now will be in effect, and the instructions of this Court in order to gain access to the United States District Courts in habeas corpus proceedings are tell your story briefly without citing cases or law.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.076" offset="1344785">In Civil Rights matters there are the recommendations of the Federal Judicial Conference.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.420" offset="1386163">These recommendations include various recommended forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.701" offset="1407270">The instructions that go with these forms state, “You will note that you are required to give a fax.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.417" offset="1494101">State here as briefly as possible the facts of your case, describe how each defendant is involved, include also the names of other persons involve dates and places.</text>

            <text syncTime="1222.469" offset="4990330">If the State Court Judge finds any merit in the petition he will point counsel to represent the petition in a plenary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.184" offset="5021154">If he finds no merit in the petition, he obviously dismisses the petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.524" offset="5038604">However, in the State Court system unlike the federal system the inmate has an absolute right to the appointment of counsel to seek certiorari from the North Carolina Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.568" offset="5090745">Therefore, he has counsel to prepare his petition for the certiorari to the North Carolina Court of Appeals where it is reviewed and of course ruled upon that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.532" offset="5146647">I would like to point out to the court that in our brief there is an appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="1409.533" offset="5738581">Now, the various cases which we refer, Mr. Nakell sent a young attorney who spent two days in our office reviewing all of these files.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.281" offset="5777556">I would ask this Court to read that Appendix, at Appendix commencing on Page 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.241" offset="5801484">It reveals how the State has appointed counsel time and time again at these post convection proceedings, how the State has appointed counsel on petition for review on certiorari, how these inmates have had their day in court time and time and time again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.503" offset="5882464">I submit that every view of this reveals that they have not been denied access, they have not been denied meaningful access, and that these inmates have had more than their day in court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.282" offset="5941605">I would further submit that this Court issue clear in the instructions to the inferior federal courts that a rereading of Johnson v. Avery is required, that the fountainhead case here states that the alternatives are required if there is a state regulation prohibiting mutual legal assistance between inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.516" offset="6046513">There is no such prohibition in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.724" offset="6059365">Therefore, the requirement of Johnson v. Avery does not come into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.959" offset="6080263">One must also read Ross v. Moffitt in conjunction with Johnson v. Avery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.473" offset="6102310">The State is not required to provide the same arsenal to prisoners, the same legal resources as a private citizen may obtain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.899" offset="6148077">I would further suggest that the case of Gilmore v. Lynch be reread, because that court assumed as many federal courts have been assuming that there is a definite obligation to provide legal facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.195" offset="6213279">The lower courts have misread Johnson; they have gone to step two without ever seeing what is required to reach step two.</text>

Avery is by letting writ writers operate in the prison, and I think that once we put the libraries in the prison it is going to diminish the powerbase of writ writers because it is going to make legal research facilities available generally and not just to the writ writers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.169" offset="13073138">Moreover, the plan provides for very limited access to the libraries.</text>

            <label>Mr. Barry Nakell</label>
            <text syncTime="3448.478" offset="13894428">Well, Mr. Justice Stevens, of course, raised the question of whether counsel is necessary, whether counsel would be an adequate substitute, and if counsel were provided and a prisoner do not want to take advantage of the provision that was made, I think the obligation of the State would be satisfied, because the obligation of the State is not to do whatever is necessary in order to satisfy the inmate, but is only to do whatever is necessary or reasonably necessary in order to assure the inmate’s access to the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.753" offset="14023473">Because a particular prisoner might prefer a different method, and I can imagine prisoners even not in that situation, prisoners who are in post conviction or 1983 actions, or civil right actions in State Court, who would prefer to have a library rather can counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.728" offset="14083345">That personal preference of the inmate in that circumstance would not control I think; it is not a Faretta type situation at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.568" offset="14110722">It is a situation in which the State’s obligation is not to provide, necessarily to provide counsel, but is only to provide the means reasonably necessary in order to ensure the prisoner meaningful access to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.229" offset="14161399">That is a different standard than the standard that applies in situations where the inmate would be entitled to the right counsel, and therefore I do not see any problem or conflict in that particular circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3529.126" offset="14216988">I would like to say that the American Correctional Association in May of this year, development I learned about since filing my brief, came out with a statement of responses to the National Advisory Commission recommendations, and they either accepted or rejected or modified the recommendations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.576" offset="14286787">They with regard to the National Advisory Commission recommendation for access to legal services, they accepted that which would provide for a library equivalent to what is provided for in the State’s plan in every prison with a design capacity of 100 or more.</text>

            <text syncTime="3607.985" offset="14532443">But I think that is important to know as Mr. Justice Blackmun brought out I think that even the State of North Carolina has taken the position that meaning access to the courts for prisoners requires that they would be given access at least to legal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.483" offset="14590434">This was in the LEAA grant application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.336" offset="14597853">I understood Mr. Safron to characterize, that is as puffing or as salesmanship or saying whatever was necessary to get an LEAA grant.</text>

            <text syncTime="3723.309" offset="14993661">The LEAA application shows that the State was planning all this time to apply to the Federal Government for 90% funding of the initial cost and 90% funding of the expenses for the first couple of years of the program, and that they have every reasonable expectation of being funded in that way because LEAA has funded other programs and indeed has funded programs to greater sums of money, particularly program which have gone on beyond Younger v.
