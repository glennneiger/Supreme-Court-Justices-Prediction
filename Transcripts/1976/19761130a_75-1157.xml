            <text syncTime="51.359" offset="308851">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.496" offset="321390">This is an appeal from a judgment of a Three-Judge District Court sitting for the Western District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.300" offset="348557">That court ruled that provisions of the New York State Constitution and of the New York State Municipal Home Rule Law relating to the procedures to be followed in connection with the effectuation of changes in the form or structure of county governments were unconstitutional as being in violation of the equal -- of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.281" offset="448449">The provisions in question set forth the procedures which are to be followed in the event that the people of a particular county wish to change the form of their government.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.703" offset="490141">The traditional form of county government in New York State is a legislative form.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.798" offset="506546">That was the form in Niagara County with which this case is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.361" offset="524831">The constitutional and statutory provisions provide as follows: If the citizens wish to change the form of their government in any respect or to transfer functions of government between towns, villages, or the county, they can only do so if the county legislature adopts a local law for presenting those changes or providing for those changes, then that local law must be put to referendum of the citizens of the county as a whole, and then in order to have the local law take effect and become the law of the county, that local law must obtain the majority of the votes cast by the voters residing in the cities of the county, and it also must obtain the majority of the votes cast by the voters residing in the towns of the county, both taken as separate units.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.257" offset="716361">And whether or not the particular proposal obtains a majority of all of the votes in the county taken as a single unit is not determinative of the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.000" offset="759411">The District Court held in this case that those provisions violated the Equal Protection Clause in view the fact that they denied the citizens of the county, the rights of the one man or "one person, one vote" doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.312" offset="816671">I might recite very briefly, if I may, the facts of the case to put the matter in perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.311" offset="836629">In 1972, the Niagara County Legislature adopted a proposed local law, which would effectuate a new charter form of government for the Niagara County residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.895" offset="882918">That new charter form of government would have changed the county form of government from a legislative form to a combined executive and legislative form.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.821" offset="918653">It would have created the new positions, elective positions of county executives and other subsidiary county officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.133" offset="947911">It adopted that local law and it put the local law to referendum in November of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.866" offset="970794">At that referendum, the voters of the towns of -- residing in the towns of the county did not approve the proposed changes by majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.591" offset="1013739">They disapproved of those changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.453" offset="1021158">The voters who resided in the cities of the county on the other hand by a majority approved the proposed changes.</text>

            <text syncTime="643.459" offset="2677217">And again in that situation, the question came as to whether that charter could be implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.204" offset="2700204">And an application was made, the decision of the Court on the first charter, the 1972 Charter came down shortly after the November 1974 referendum with respect to the 1974 charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.062" offset="2751613">The Niagara County people made an application to the Court to have its judgment apply not to the 1972 Charter which was subject matter of the previous action or the existing action, but to have it apply instead to the 1974 Charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.465" offset="2801246">The Court refused to do that apparently on the grounds that it not have jurisdiction over the 1974 Charter which was not subject to the lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.138" offset="2827891">So, a judgment was entered in January of 1975, declaring a 1972 Charter to be the law of the land on the grounds that the New York State Constitution was unconstitutional and Municipal Home Rule Law was unconstitutional, and that since in spite of the fact that there were no statutory provisions to support this kind of an approach, that since there had been an overall majority, that therefore, that these changes that were proposed could take effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.909" offset="2927052">And so, the January 1975 judgment said, the 1972 Charter is the law of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.734" offset="2954324">The Attorney General had indicated that he was going to appeal from that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.992" offset="2975326">Shortly before the time to appeal expired, he made an announcement that he was not going to carry forward the appeal, and so the town of Lockport, supported by the other towns of the county, made an application for intervention which was granted for the purpose of prosecuting this appeal, and that’s why we’re here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="735.779" offset="3046484">After that, after the appeal was filed, the State and county officials purported to put into effect the 1974 Charter and not the 1972 Charter as was provided in the original judgment in order of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.554" offset="3105625">We raised questions of mootness on the ground that the subject matter of the original action had been destroyed by the subsequent conduct of the party’s litigant.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.511" offset="3141465">That matter was up before the Court on our original jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.821" offset="3158706">The case was remanded to the District Court, the original judgment was vacated, the case was remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in light of the 1974 Charter referendum.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.452" offset="3201128">And another proceeding was had, again no proof, but counsels were summoned to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.291" offset="3220564">The District Court found that there was no mootness.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.698" offset="3230177">The District Court denied an application by the call, plaintiffs here.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.584" offset="3245746">They had made an application to make sure that the case did in fact have jurisdiction over the 1974 Charter to amend their complaint so as to raise the questions of constitutionality as to the 1974 Charter which would’ve fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.202" offset="3296214">We would’ve had a trial and we could’ve gone through the whole thing, but that was denied as well and the Court found no mootness.</text>
