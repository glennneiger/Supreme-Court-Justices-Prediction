            <text syncTime="17.023" offset="168577">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.840" offset="179862">I appear here on behalf of the City of Madison, Joint School District No. 8 and the City of Madison Board of Education, the Appellants in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.553" offset="214761">This case is on appeal from a judgment of the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.713" offset="231375">The appellants drew into question for the validity of a State statute as applied and interpreted, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court upheld the statute after specifically considering the appellant?s constitutional challenge.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.540" offset="286650">Thus, this Court?s jurisdiction is invoked under Title 28, Section 1257 (2) of the United States Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.445" offset="326252">This case presents the question of whether a State labor statute, as interpreted and applied, may constitutionally mandate that certain individuals be excluded from speaking in a public form and solely on the basis of the content of a proposed speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.370" offset="393961">The facts may be briefly stated as follows: The City of Madison Board of Education is a public do elected public body charged with a possession, care and control of the school affairs of the City of Madison School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.679" offset="443176">The Board holds regular meetings on the first and third Monday of every month.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.177" offset="461253">The Board has determined that each report at a portion of each of its regular meetings will be devoted to the receipt of public comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.832" offset="495839">This portion of the agenda is denoted in the agenda as public appearances.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.461" offset="518304">At its regular meeting of December 6th 1971, a number of people were allowed to address the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.236" offset="545472">Among those was the President of Madison Teachers Incorporated, the teacher union.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.154" offset="565116">The President spoke and presented a petition to the Board, asking for a quick resolution in the current bargaining talks that were occurring.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.880" offset="600015">After the president of the teachers? union spoke, Albert Holmquist, another teacher, was allowed to address the Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.435" offset="630213">He spoke about an item that was being negotiated between the Board and MTI and presented the results of a survey of the teaching staff and then circulated within the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.511" offset="674516">After completion of its regular meeting, the Board retired into executive session and discussed the status of their then current negotiations with the exclusive bargaining representative of the teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.661" offset="715163">At that executive session, they prepared directions for their negotiators, the superintendent, and adjourned.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.762" offset="743584">The following day a negotiation session occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.980" offset="756436">Assistant Superintendent and Superintendent gave the directions or proposals of the Board to the teachers? representatives and discussion ensued.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.630" offset="799068">Discussion concluded with tentative agreement when the teachers accepted the Board?s proposal.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.323" offset="821743">Formal agreement was finally ratified between the parties about a week later on December 14th, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.841" offset="847865">Approximately one month later, Madison Teachers Incorporated filed a complaint with the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.064" offset="880779">It alleged that the Board of Education committed an unfair labor practice when it allowed Albert Holmquist to speak at his public meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.761" offset="915574">The Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission concluded that the Board?s activity at its public meeting constituted prohibited labor practice and issue the following order.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.821" offset="959774">The Board shall immediately cease and desist permitting employees other than representatives of Madison Teachers Incorporated to appear and speak at meetings of the Board of Education on matters subject to collective bargaining between it and Madison Teachers Incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.370" offset="1033961">The Commission decision and order were affirmed by the Circuit Court in Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.354" offset="1049948">On appeal to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, just stayed writing the majority decision and noting specifically that all the parties involved in this case had conceded that speaking in the form of negotiating or bargaining could be constitutionally restricted to the exclusive representative of the teachers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1266.339" offset="5165906">Because it was my feeling that the Wisconsin Supreme Court decision in this case was wrapped up in speech, in the speech of an employee at a public hearing of a pubic body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.242" offset="5221494">I felt it would be essential to tell us or read to the Court exactly what the employee said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.899" offset="5248139">It only took about two-and-a-half minute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.900" offset="5256081">I do not think it is important now, but a review of those remarks I submit, indicates that Mr. Holmquist when he spoke to the Board was speaking as a citizen and in a citizenship capacity as opposed to an employee?s capacity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.036" offset="5324626">He was providing information to both parties regarding the negotiation process suggesting that there was an impasse that had occurred and a way to provide a catalyst to get over that particular impasse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.562" offset="5390768">The peculiar and obnoxious part of the definition that the Wisconsin Supreme Court applies to negotiation is the premise that you negotiate with somebody when you listen to somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.263" offset="5461507">This definition we submit in our brief has been rejected as a proper definition in private sector labor relations, and we have cited a number of cases where the private employers have indeed listened or received petitions from their employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.692" offset="5527232">It is also contrary to the statutory rights in both Wisconsin and the Federal Labor Statutes, which preserve the right of employers to present grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.621" offset="5566938">Finally, the cases cited by the Appellee, Meadow and the Wisconsin Supreme Court, Meadow and Emporium, these cases suggest that the character of the underlying conduct in order to find negotiation is more than merely listening.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.988" offset="5656485">The definition, as I suggested of negotiation, as meaning merely listening is particularly obnoxious in the public sector because what it does is, it forecloses in this case a public hearing to a particular individual simply on the basis of the content of the speech he wishes to make, nothing more, just the speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.763" offset="5775604">This undercuts the core value of the First Amendment to free interchange, unfettered interchange of ideas, ideas only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.182" offset="5825236">If indeed, the Wisconsin Supreme Court was to appropriately define negotiation, we wouldn?t run into this constitutional collision that we have in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.296" offset="5901723">I think this Court has been emphatic in relationship to the kinds of rights that individuals have in public forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.337" offset="5949893">This was a classic public forum, a School Board meeting, an open public hearing at a School Board meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.463" offset="5982389">In this classic public forum, certainly, speech should not be selectively on a basis of content and the status, supposed status of an individual be abridged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.022" offset="6048636">We submit that, in conclusion, that the definition of negotiation adopted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court must be rejected as inherently unconstitutional, since it does indeed undercut our commitment to free and open debate on public questions, since it rejects this Court?s holding that teachers have certain constitutional rights and public employers must be responsive to these rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.758" offset="6175486">Finally, because it prohibits expression in a public forum in the absence of a substantive much less a weighty reason as required in public forum matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="2928.536" offset="11814696">Mr. Chief Justice, I just have about three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.964" offset="11836325">One, I believe Mr. Justice Marshall is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.570" offset="11850745">The totality of the conduct is not before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.662" offset="11863179">What is before this Court is the Wisconsin Supreme Court?s definition of ?negotiation?.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.645" offset="11887107">That definition of negotiation creates an unconstitutional intrusion in our view for the First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.671" offset="11919186">Mr. Kelly, and in that sense, a mere remand of the order without instructions that such a definition creates that constitutional intrusion would be unfortunate in the appellant?s view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.853" offset="11979894">Mr. Kelly apparently has retreated from the position of the order ought to be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.236" offset="12001419">Let me suggest that the totality of the bargaining conduct, the totality of the conduct that Mr. Kelly suggest is bargaining, cannot be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.412" offset="12046141">What occurred was a circulation of a petition in non-working areas, on non-working times in the school; this was found by just stayed in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.432" offset="12094206">We take a look at your decision in the NLRB v. Magnavox.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.220" offset="12117403">This Court has recognized that communication between employees at the workplace, in non-working areas and non-working times, is something that is permissible under federal labor statutes. That communication is important in order to prevent entrenchment of the majority representative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3022.762" offset="12191591">So, that aspect of the totality of the conduct is inappropriate for consideration here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3027.423" offset="12210190">Well, but the fact that?s permissible under federal labor statutes doesn?t mean that the State of Wisconsin has to allow it under State labor statutes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3034.547" offset="12238716">That is correct but to suggest that to allow it was before the Court or that issue was before the Court is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3043.171" offset="12273197">The only issue before the Wisconsin Supreme Court was the issue of negotiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.733" offset="12295454">The other way supposedly that the Board aided and abetted Mr. Holmquist was to allow the use of mailboxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3071.354" offset="12385942">Doesn?t there?s dual question here whether the First Amendment would permit that kind of prohibition at a public meeting?</text>

            <text syncTime="3094.854" offset="12479878">One final word, Mr. Kelly and myself have been accorded by this Court an opportunity for now almost an hour to engage in colloquy and question and answers and I don?t believe there is any member of this Court or in the courtroom, who would believe that what Mr. Kelly and I were doing was negotiating with this Court with regard to the order or its decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.355" offset="12601922">That is essentially what Mr. Holmquist did, he talked to the Board of Education and nothing more.</text>
