            <text syncTime="53.026" offset="312563">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.743" offset="327505">I shall emphasize the importance in reversing the Sixth Circuit from the perspective of providing fairness to the victims of employment discrimination and encouraging effective implementation of the public policy of achieving equal employment opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.792" offset="395632">Mr. Newman will argue from the perspective of encouraging voluntary compliance and incorporating equal employment opportunity into the law of the shops.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.199" offset="437324">This case arises from a straight-forward set of undisputed facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.865" offset="455923">Mrs. Guy, a Black woman, was originally hired by Robbins and Myers on November 1, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.969" offset="484344">From October 19 through October 24, 1971, Mrs. Guy was absent due to illness.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.137" offset="513079">That illness was excused by the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.132" offset="529066">On October 25, Mrs. Guy did not return to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.522" offset="546620">She was immediately discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.507" offset="558532">Within two days, she caused a review to be undertaken of her discharge by filing a grievance, pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement entered into between the Union and the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.879" offset="612031">Within 22 days, on November 18, 1971, the personnel director after reviewing the decision denied her grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.184" offset="649229">Within 84 days of that decision, on February 10, 1972, Mrs. Guy filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.604" offset="690920">That charge was filed 108 days after the initial company decision to discharge Mrs. Guy.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.932" offset="720177">Herein, lays the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.915" offset="728119">The lower courts held that the 90-day limitations period began to run from October 25, 1971, the date of the initial company decision to discharge Mrs. Guy.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.937" offset="788200">That 90-day provision was amended by the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 to 180 days, but petitioners here raise three grounds why Mrs. Guy’s charge should be treated as timely filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.617" offset="850999">The first one is, that the final occurrence of the unlawful act did not occur until November 18, 1971 when the personnel director of the company last acted pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement in a contractual relationship between the company and Mrs. Guy.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.902" offset="936158">Two, the petitioners submit that the filing of a grievance towards the running of the period of limitations during the resort to the grievance procedure and lastly, the petitioners submit that the 180-day period provided by the 1972 amendment applies to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.670" offset="1015152">The first ground that the practice had not occurred until November 18 when the personnel director of the company affirmed the initial decision to discharge Mrs. Guy does not involve any analysis of legislative history or any review of this court’s seminal decisions in Johnson v. REA and Alexander v. Gardner-Denver.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.807" offset="1095714">Rather the issue is as the Seventh Circuit stated in Moore v. Sunbeam Corp., when was the last occurrence of the unlawful act?</text>
            <text syncTime="256.817" offset="1127792">We submit that that occurrence was when the personnel director last acted under the collective bargaining relationship with Mrs. Guy.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="268.307" offset="1173768">Did the personnel director have taken an affirmative action at that time or did he just sit?</text>

            <label>Mr. Barry L. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="275.701" offset="1203338">Your Honor, the contract is set out I think in 37A and 38A of the appendix which requires the personnel director to make a decision within 10 days of the submission of a third-step grievance to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.987" offset="1272406">When the company initially made its decision to discharge Mrs. Guy, the situation was analogous to an anticipatory contract breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.040" offset="1320680">The contract between Mrs. Guy and the company was not thereby terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.636" offset="1339071">She had a right to seek review of the decision to discharge her by filing a grievance and proceeding to a conference with her general foreman and the personnel director of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.698" offset="1395286">During these three steps of intra company review, the company had sole power to reverse its initial decision, reinstate Mrs. Guy and cure the breach of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.918" offset="1444187">To treat the denial of her grievance by the company as the final occurrence which triggers the running of the limitations period, within which the worker must file a charge with the EEOC or courts with common sense.</text>

            <text syncTime="361.010" offset="1544497">Would it not be appropriate to postpone the complete denial of her contractual rights or termination of her contractual rights until the time in which she could obtain review expired?</text>

            <label>Mr. Barry L. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="373.028" offset="1592563">Yes, Mr. Justice Stevens, it could be that the period here have been told until November 28 since the Union had 10 days to indicate whether they were going to take their option and proceed to arbitration.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="388.424" stopTime="403.897">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="388.424" offset="1654212">Is that your position or is it whenever they -- I do not see how to differentiate in other words between the denial after the third stage and the initial discharge because under your theory neither of those was the expiration of the contractual relationship.</text>

          <turn speaker="barry_l_goldstein" startTime="403.897" stopTime="641.246">
            <label>Mr. Barry L. Goldstein</label>
            <text syncTime="403.897" offset="1716070">I think, Mr. Justice Stevens, it would be more correct to say November 28 than November 18 when the decision was made not to proceed to arbitration, but it was unnecessary to reach that question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.308" offset="1793706">When the agreement for which you bargained provides protection against discrimination in employment and also provides an accessible means of redress, it is understandable that a worker like Mrs. Guy who was also a Union steward would turn first to her collective bargaining agreement and the support of her fellow workers before turning to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.690" offset="1883253">Accordingly, petitioner, Guy’s charge was timely filed regardless of whether Congress intended that the limitation period could be affected by equitable consideration such as tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.826" offset="1931841">However, an analysis of the legislative history the Congressional policies effectuated by Title VII and this court’s opinion in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Company, all support tolling the limitations period during resort to the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.136" offset="1988997">The Sixth Circuit’s and respondent’s reliance on Johnson v. REA is misplaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.975" offset="2012403">In Johnson, this court held that federal actions undertaken pursuant to Section 1981 and Title VII were independent, separate and distinct and stated that the filing of an EEOC charge does not necessarily toll the limitations period for filing a 1981 action.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.929" offset="2104249">The court in comparing the remedies available under 1981 and Title VII, examined each and said that each has its advantages and each has its disadvantages.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.541" offset="2146672">Here, however, there is no such parity of judicial enforceable remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.789" offset="2167675">The grievance procedure is conciliatory and pragmatic, dear does this court have said to the law of the shot, not the law of the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.986" offset="2200484">Second, in Johnson the court looked to the state tolling law.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.707" offset="2219293">Here, the only question is the application of a federal limitations period.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.330" offset="2241862">This court has repeatedly stated that the question of whether a federal limitation period is tolled or not is not a semantic question.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.662" offset="2279165">It is not a determination of whether the period is procedural or substantive.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.588" offset="2302884">Rather, it is a question of examining what it the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.802" offset="2323678">Here, Congress made it clear in several ways, in the legislative history of the 1972 Equal Employment Opportunity Act that the limitations periods in 706 and specifically 706(e) were to be interpreted so “as to give persons the maximum benefit of the law.”</text>
            <text syncTime="577.066" offset="2408733">The Congress specifically approved this court’s flexible interpretations of the limitations period for deferral to state, the employment agencies in Love v. Pullman Company and it specifically approved other equitable considerations such as the notion of a continuing violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.039" offset="2492638">Lastly, the court in Johnson stated that the adoption of the state tolling principles was not inconsistent in that case with federal policies since the court pointed out little was at stake and here, there is much at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.696" offset="2559302">The accommodation with the effective utilization of the system for an industrial self government to achieve equal employment opportunity, the grievance machinery is not an alternative judicial remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.040" offset="2608622">Rather, it is a basic component of industrial self government and a prime mechanism by which fair employment practices must be incorporated into American industry if the goal of equal employment opportunity is to be achieved.</text>

            <text syncTime="641.246" offset="2665464">You have been talking so far, Mr. Goldstein, about the Congressional purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.895" offset="2704125">What are we to decide the case on, the Congressional purposes or the language of the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="658.944" offset="2736308">The language of the statute is that a charge shall be filed within 90 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.</text>

            <text syncTime="814.213" offset="3357395">Also, Mr. Chief Justice, I believe in our reply brief we pointed to the statute limitations periods that were discussed in the Burnett Case and also in the Midstate Case which were as mandatory as the statute in this case, but nevertheless, the court said that those mandatory time periods did not preclude the application of equitable considerations to a decision as to when those time periods would begin to run.</text>

            <text syncTime="913.695" offset="3755293">In Alexander, the court considered the conflict or rather the accommodation of two paramount federal policies, fair employment practices and industrial self government.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.733" offset="3795417">The court in Alexander, by its ruling, was pointing out that the procedure for the resort to the law of the shot and the law of the land should supplement each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.350" offset="3849856">Repeatedly, the court pointed out that a proper grievance arbitration procedure could effectively assist in implementing Title VII and even indicated that under certain circumstances evidence gathered in that process could be used by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.537" offset="3914640">In conclusion, this court has delineated at some length the law enforcing the policy of equal employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.234" offset="3941389">In Griggs and Albemarle Paper Company, unlawful practices were defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.731" offset="3959466">In Albemarle Paper Company in Franks v. Bowman Transportation Company, the requirements for adequate remedy discussed.</text>

            <text syncTime="998.570" offset="4094780">Mr. Goldstein has articulated the legal theories supporting our view that the charge was filed timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.360" offset="4117977">I should like to make one additional comment with respect to the first point, namely the date on which the violation occurred and then devote the remainder of my time to the equitable considerations in respect to the tolling issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.408" offset="4170117">In the industrial world, it is well understood that a first-level foreman’s decision is hardly the last word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.840" offset="4203867">This generally results or may result in request from the Union for a review of that decision which the foreman’s action has triggered and that decision is then as you know reviewed and culminates into review through various steps of the grievance procedure, including high-ranking company and Union officials.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.947" offset="4368334">It is a review by other management to determine whether the action is consistent with the company policy or the Union contract and that, I submit, is the way in which it was looked at in the industrial world.</text>

            <text syncTime="1260.133" offset="5141036">In this case, unfair charge is the typical way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.374" offset="5153993">There are many contracts indeed that prohibit a grievance from being filed if you allege race or sex discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.179" offset="5181265">It is not arbitral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.238" offset="5185444">The General Electric contract for example, provides that you can grieve on that but you cannot arbitrate on that, with the result that our Union typically files a grievance and does not allege race or sex discrimination because as soon as we allege that, it no longer becomes arbitral.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.496" offset="5242496">Nevertheless, the issue goes before the arbitrator in the context of just cause, because whether you view this as race discrimination or sex discrimination, you come out to the same place if the treatment is disparate, which is a basic fundamental of arbitration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1400.067" offset="5700788">Let me suggest, in this regard, that if the employer treated this as a final decision and approached the subsequent steps of a grievance procedure with that in mind and failed to approach the subsequent steps of a grievance procedure with an open mind, they would be in violation of Section 8(a)(5) of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.367" offset="5773931">I suggest that that requires to the extent that he is required to come to that table with an open mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.497" offset="5798486">He cannot have come and as you have asked about earlier, Mr. Chief Justice, just sit there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.269" offset="5821578">He has to come there with an open mind and give a de novo review of whether the conduct warranted the results that were imposed, whether it would be to sustain it, reverse it or compromise it and these grievance meetings are hardly perfunctory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.908" offset="5880093">Mitigating circumstances would be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.570" offset="5890751">Other courts have held as it has been suggested that the grievance does not occur until the grievance procedure is exhausted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.105" offset="5920948">In Butler versus the Teamsters, 514 Federal 2nd 442, for example, the Eight Circuit’s state of the common sense indicates that there is no accrual until all facts have been learned including those obtained during the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.022" offset="5980612">That has been upheld by a recent district court in Ohio and I would like just briefly to touch upon tolling and comment that if you find the occurrence took place on October 25 rather than the third step of the grievance procedure, there is substantial equitable grounds to toll on this case aside from to be in a court with a federal policy, articulated in Alexander and numerous cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.613" offset="6118956">It is clear that non-discrimination matters are going to have to be handled through the grievance procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1533.629" offset="6235044">For your argument really to be sound, should you not also have the burden of showing that the grievance procedure and the arbitration procedure focused on the charge of discrimination?</text>

            <text syncTime="1738.272" offset="7053617">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.101" offset="7064902">First of all, we disagree with the petitioners here as to the issue before this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.127" offset="7089040">We submit that the issues here are not as complicated and complex as they have made it out in their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.853" offset="7119864">There was only one issue decided by the District Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.203" offset="7137314">There was only one issue that was briefed on the merits by both parties in the Court of Appeals, and there was only one issue decided by the Court of Appeals and that issue was simply whether or not the filing of a grievance under collective bargaining contract operates to sustain or toll the time for filing the charge with the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.850" offset="7227906">We contend that this is the only issue that is properly before this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.361" offset="7253924">Now, the facts as have been noted are basically undisputed and simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.187" offset="7281301">This employee was discharged on October 25 and she did not file a charge until 108 days from the date of her discharge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.907" offset="7324142">Now, she filed a grievance or had a grievance filed on her behalf that alleged the violation of the contract as she claimed the discharge was unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.475" offset="7366355">The Union decided not to take this case to arbitration and nothing happened on this grievance from the date it was denied by the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.523" offset="7410555">Nothing happened after that point and nothing happened until the employee filed a charge with EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.018" offset="7440543">It is interesting to note here that the plaintiff, when she filed her case in the District Court, alleged two claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.233" offset="7469382">She alleged a claim under 1866 Civil Rights Act and she alleged a claim under Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.932" offset="7504177">In the argument on the motion to dismiss or claim under the 1866 Civil Rights Act, the motion to dismiss was granted, the plaintiff defended her failure to file her lawsuit within the one year state statute of limitations on the ground that the time of her filing of the EEOC charge had tolled the time for her filing this lawsuit under 1866.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.114" offset="7616922">In the argument on the dismissal or the motion to dismiss the Title VII claim, she took the position and the sole position that the filing of the grievance tolled the time for filing the charge with EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.741" offset="7691423">The District Court rejected these arguments and dismissed both of these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.587" offset="7714829">The plaintiff appealed the claim under Title VII and as I noted the Court of Appeals deciding the issue of tolling and relying on this court’s decision in Alexander and in Johnson, affirmed the dismissal by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.103" offset="7800929">The petitioners and the respondents in this case basically agree on the test that should be applied by this court in deciding this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.610" offset="7842933">And the test is whether or not the failure to apply tolling would be inconsistent with the federal policy underlying the cause of action under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.326" offset="7889849">We both agree that this is the basic test that should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.212" offset="7905314">Now, what we disagree on here are two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.866" offset="7919942">Number one, what is this federal policy and number two would it be inconsistent with this federal policy to refuse to apply tolling?</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.421" offset="7974173">This court in Alexander and in Johnson had several things to say about this federal policy that we contend should control the answer to the first question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.506" offset="8022551">This court stated that the underlying policy of Title VII was to provide the Title VII remedies as parallel and overlapping to any other remedies that might be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.237" offset="8069467">The court also stated that the policy underlying Title VII was that the EEOC and the court should have the preferred role in resolving claims of discrimination and not arbitrators and grievance procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.695" offset="8147312">The court stated that the procedures of Title VII should be given full play and should not be made dependent on what might happen in a grievance or arbitration procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.581" offset="8194855">The court also noted in Alexander that the underlying policy of Title VII was that precise jurisdictional prerequisites must be met before an individual will be able to assert a claim under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.107" offset="8256922">And one of these prerequisites is the timely filing of a charge with EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.366" offset="8282000">Now, we can see nothing inconsistent with these policies to refuse to apply tolling in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.190" offset="8313242">And we have heard nothing from the petitioners that suggests that there is anything inconsistent with these policies to require this employee to file her charge within 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.543" offset="8370711">The basic position of the petitioner seem to be that it would be preferable to sustain Title VII remedies and the remedies under Title VII so that the arbitration and grievance procedure will be given a chance to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.543" offset="8430689">They basically take the position that these two remedies are so interrelated and dependent that what happens in the pursuit of one remedy will necessarily affect what happens in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.982" offset="8488471">These same arguments were made to this court in Alexander and in Johnson and were rejected by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.523" offset="8526610">Their perusable argument is that, to require an employee to file a grievance or to file an EEOC charge while a grievance is pending would in some way interfere with the National Policy that encourages the settlement of labor disputes, the grievance and arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.917" offset="8604142">Now, we submit that this has not been shown to be the case or that we take the position that there would be no substantial interference with the grievance and arbitration procedure to require an employee to file an EEOC charge within 180 days under the new law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.397" offset="8690137">In any event, we take the position that is not the policy underlying the national labor laws that they should be considered here is the policies underlying Title VII that should control whether or not tolling should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.386" offset="8754084">The petitioners in their brief, took the position that allowing tolling to take place will encourage the settlement of disputes that will discourage the filing of charges with the EEOC and would cut down on the work of the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.775" offset="8839557">This court in Alexander answered this argument by stating that Congress intended for the commission and the courts to handle claims of discrimination and not arbitrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.269" offset="8897549">Contrary to this argument, Congress did not intend to discourage charges with the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.370" offset="8918029">They intended to encourage charges and we see nothing inconsistent with the policies underlying Title VII to require an employee to file a charge with EEOC.</text>

            <text syncTime="3073.811" offset="12395763">That is a point that, I think, should be noted.Judge Edward’s dissent states that they should not decide the issue but send it back to the District Court and let the District Court decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.242" offset="12449471">In effect, that is his dissent, that they should send the case back to the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.187" offset="12469219">I would like to say, concerning the argument that the discharge was not a final act until the termination of the grievance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.286" offset="12509657">As I stated earlier, there is also a question here of whether of not this issue is properly before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.068" offset="12544765">We contend that this issue was raised for the first time in brief to this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.117" offset="12584994">Under this court’s rules and policies, it should not be considered since it was not considered by the courts below.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.076" offset="12620834">But in any event, we contend that a discharge of an employee is a final and completed act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.044" offset="12652703">It was a final and completed act in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.920" offset="12664197">There was nothing left to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.459" offset="12674333">The only thing left to be done was a question of whether or not the company would change its mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.464" offset="12698365">Now, the company still has this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.312" offset="12705784">They can still change their mind, but that does not make the discharge, not a final completed act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.894" offset="12740057">The denial of the grievance was also a final act and completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.994" offset="12764507">It was a separate act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.606" offset="12770881">The employee could have filed EEOC charge over the denial of the grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.284" offset="12797631">The employee filed a charge over the discharge of the employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.258" offset="12817484">And it should be noted also that plaintiff’s complaint in the District Court alleged that this discharge occurred on October 25, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.685" offset="12871191">So we contend that this argument does not lend any assistance to the petitioner’s case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.305" offset="12933676">In conclusion, we contend that the only issue before this court is whether or not tolling should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.956" offset="12964292">And based on the policies of this court, we contend it would not be inconsistent with the policies underlying Title VII of the Civil Rights Act to refuse to apply tolling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.370" offset="13021970">And since it would not be inconsistent, we contend that the decision of the court below should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3313.851" offset="13355920">We submit that since the statute of limitations is a defense, that the burden has the obligation to prove all those elements and at worst, this case should be remanded on that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.178" offset="13405239">Secondly, I want to make clear that we are not, in any way, suggesting here that the employee should give up the right to utilize Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.686" offset="13447244">What we are saying is that, for various reasons that we get into a brief and would not be able to get into here, the employee maybe hound by the fact that a grievance is pending and it may disrupt the informal atmosphere in terms of settling the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.762" offset="13519551">There would be people looking over their shoulders at lawyers rather than trying to settle a grievance, with the lawyers taking over rather than the industry relations people.</text>
