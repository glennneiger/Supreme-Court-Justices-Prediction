            <text syncTime="68.063" offset="376644">The Connecticut policy which is Section 275 of the Welfare Department manual provided that in order for the state to pay for an abortion under the Title 19 program, the attending physician, the physician of her choice was required to submit a certificate of medical necessity which is set forth at page 47 of the appendix.</text>

            <text syncTime="120.283" offset="585519">In addition to that certificate of medical necessity, the doctor must also submit a form W601 which is at page 45 of the appendix, requesting a prior authorization, prior approval for payment for the abortion and in that form, he must indicate what the medical need for the abortion is and as I’ve just stated a moment ago an answer to Mr. Justice Brennan’s question, the attending physician’s medical judgment as to the need for the abortion is never questioned by Connecticut.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.694" offset="1139210">Well, the plaintiffs then brought this action after the refusal by the two original plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.741" offset="1163348">Their physicians would not submit the statement of medical necessity.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.270" offset="1177454">There were several subsequent intervening plaintiffs for which temporary restraining orders were granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.520" offset="1202427">But in no case that the attending physician submitted the certificate of medical necessity and this action was then brought challenging the state policy on both statutory and constitutional grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.179" offset="1253104">The single-judge District Court on the plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment disposed of the case initially on the pendant statutory claim holding that the Federal Title 19 Statute required payment for elective abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.621" offset="1318828">The defending commissioner then appealed and the Second Circuit reversed and remanded holding in effect that while Title 19 permits payment for abortion, it does not require payment for elective abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.998" offset="1376402">And one judge, Judge Mulligan of the Second Circuit dissented in part from that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.115" offset="1408899">The three-judge court when it remanded, instructed -- excuse me, the Circuit Court when it remanded, the Second Circuit instructed the District Court to determine if Connecticut would continue to refuse to pay for elective abortion since the Second circuit had now decided that it was permissible to pay for elective abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.828" offset="1503671">State's position originally had been that the federal statute prevented payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.595" offset="1530734">The state informed the Court that it would not -- it elected not change its policy and it would not pay for elective abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.914" offset="1556020">And then once again, a three-judge court was convened and once again on the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, the three-judge court after oral argument held that Connecticut’s medical abortion policy was invalid insofar as it required certification that an abortion is medically or psychiatrically necessary and insofar as it requires prior to the performance of an abortion, any form of approval or consent or any other condition or requirement for the reimbursement of the expenses of an abortion performed during the first trimester of the pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.233" offset="1701366">This case was limited to first trimester abortions by the three-judge court since there were no second semester abortions performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.615" offset="1738877">There is a second semester abortion performed in the appendix at page 46 or 47 I believe which is a little different, but apparently is not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.820" offset="1783704">Prior to the entry of that judgment by the three-judge court, the plaintiffs, the defending commissioner had made a motion to strike certain affidavits which had been attached to the plaintiff’s memorandum in support of its motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.544" offset="1878580">And at the oral argument, the defendant requested the court to rule on the motion to strike and the court -- and the three-judge court said it would rule on that motion, but it never did so.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.698" offset="1947230">Now, in striking down Connecticut’s Medicaid policy, the District Court held essentially that the constitution does not require the state to pay for any medical services, but nevertheless once a state chooses to establish a program to pay for the medical expenses of the indigent and as part of that program it pays for therapeutic abortions and it pays for pregnancy, child birth, prenatal and postnatal care, but it does not pay for elective abortions.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.506" offset="2090381">In that event that the three-judge court held that it was not -- the state was not acting strictly neutral and in that -- and so, it was infringing thereby upon the plaintiff's constitutionally elected right to have an abortion as announced in Roe v. Wade and it cited Dunn v. Blumstein in support of its decision and Maricopa County Memorial Hospital and Shapiro v. Thompson, the presidency case.</text>

            <text syncTime="578.178" offset="2417121">The Shapiro case seems to always come up in any discussion of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.389" offset="2457976">We believe that the fallacy of the District Court’s reasoning in this case was that Connecticut has no program for funding the medical expenses of pregnancy as such or prenatal or postnatal care.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.426" offset="2530074">What it does have is a program to pay for medical expenses which are medically necessary for the patient’s health and the test -- that is the test, whether it’s medically necessary for the patient’s health, if it is, it will be paid for, if it is not, they will be excluded except for some medically necessary services which are excluded because of their prohibitive cost and dental expenses, particularly periodontia and orthodontia are two that are very costly that are excluded although they are admittedly necessary -- medically necessary for the patient’s health.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.113" offset="2700810">Under Connecticut’s program, pregnancy and abortion are treated alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.833" offset="2723694">They must both be medically necessary for the patient’s health in order to be paid for under the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.662" offset="2755041">I think that the plaintiff's make much of the fact that if you pay for the expenses of pregnancy, you should pay for abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.207" offset="2793179">But it is the medical community that has determined really that the expenses of child birth are medically necessary and there was no testimony of any medical testimony and indeed the plaintiffs have admitted in their brief that the expenses of child birth and pregnancy are medically necessary for the patient’s health.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.837" offset="2883772">Now that test of medical necessity has been Connecticut’s test since the inception of its program in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.334" offset="2913761">That was nearly eight years before this Court announced the constitutionally protective right of a woman in consultation with their physician to choose to have an abortion in Roe versus Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.889" offset="2967991">The District Court did not dispute that this test of medical necessity for the patient’s health was the test for payment under Connecticut’s program.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.245" offset="3013339">The Lower Court simply refused to judge whether this classification offended the Equal Protection Clause and instead the Lower Court set forth its own perceived classification by narrowly focusing on how elective abortion was treated as compared to pregnancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.700" offset="3099230">The Lower Court, we believe thereby was side of the fact that the test for payment was whether the service was medically necessary for the patient’s health and that the whole purpose of the program was to provide necessary healthcare and that pregnancy or abortion or whatever were merely incidental treatments under the program of medical providing necessary healthcare.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.608" offset="3226812">Now, we think there would be validity to the District Court’s opinion if Connecticut had either done one of the two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.047" offset="3252621">If Connecticut had a separate program just for payment of expenses of child birth and pregnancy or if abortions which were admittedly medically necessary for the patient’s health were excluded from Connecticut’s program which they are not, in either on those events, we believe that the rationale of the District Court would be valid, but Connecticut has no such programs and it has never had such programs and consequently --</text>

            <text syncTime="984.134" offset="4040892">But that is a decision in our view that is up to the legislature or by its delegation to the administrative agency because we think it’s a perfectly rational basis for the state to setup a program whose purpose is to provide necessary healthcare and that implies that it will exclude unnecessary healthcare.</text>

            <text syncTime="1345.227" offset="5485255">As we were saying before luncheon, it’s the state's contention that there is no invidious discrimination on the basis of its classification of necessary versus unnecessary medical expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.631" offset="5542933">Therefore, there is no denial of equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.446" offset="5558188">I believe as Mr. Justice Stewart in a separate opinion in San Antonio versus Rodriguez summarized that purpose of the Equal Protection Clause was to measure the validity of the classifications made by the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.205" offset="5629241">This classification withstands that validity we believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.255" offset="5645437">Of course, the fact that there is no invidious discrimination is not all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.112" offset="5664872">The state must of course prove that Connecticut’s action is not a mere pretext or a subterfuge or as the counsel in the previous case stated a smokescreen for the state to discriminate against abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.250" offset="5721401">There is no evidence in the record to support such a charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.712" offset="5743240">The District Court rejected Connecticut’s asserted purpose of preserving its physical integrity out of hand and then it attribute -- thereby attributed to the state of Connecticut an imputative reason, if you call it a unarticulated reason for avoiding the expenditure of public funds for purpose, the state found morally objectionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.039" offset="5848566">There was nothing in the record to support that that was imputative to the state despite the fact that Connecticut’s program included payment for no other medical service which was not necessary for the patient’s health, despite the fact that other medical services which were medically necessary, some were excluded because of their prohibitive cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.810" offset="5939681">And another factor is that the very day after this decision was announced December 31, 1975, the very next day, Connecticut was forced to implement cut backs in its Medicaid program of medically necessary services because of its physical crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.175" offset="6009062">As it turned out, that was in preliminary enjoined about two weeks later and that is the status of that matter now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.634" offset="6034975">The state has not pursued that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.317" offset="6041663">The physical picture has brightened somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.812" offset="6055664">So all of these factors attest to the legitimacy of the classification made by Connecticut’s program and when this was considered in addition to the fact that the medical judgment of medical necessity is what solely to the attending physician of the plaintiff's own choice and the further fact as indicated in the answers to the interrogatories that prior to the single-judge District Court’s entry of the first injunction, some 1,410 abortions were performed under the state's program in an eleven-and-a-half month period.</text>

            <text syncTime="2011.902" offset="8152043">I represent the plaintiffs, appellees in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.413" offset="8170015">This argument is being held today because the State of Connecticut denies Medicaid assistance to women who choose to terminate their pregnancies by abortion, while at the same time, it provides payment for any and all forms of obstetrical care involved in the birth of a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.744" offset="8255384">We have a basic factual dispute with the state's assertion that this is simply a requirement that is part and parcel of the entire Medicaid program and throughout my argument I will refer to the reasons for that dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.213" offset="8317241">We also disagree with his assertion that Connecticut has a more liberal policy than this Court heard about in Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.904" offset="8352037">There is no requirement in Pennsylvania that I know about that a doctor must especially certify that an abortion is necessary for the health of the patient nor is there a requirement in that state that the state give prior authorization for every abortion under Medicaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.103" offset="8424761">The state in Connecticut is denying this assistance in a way which is directly contrary to this Court’s recognition that a woman has a fundamental right with her physician to decide whether or not to bear a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.563" offset="8490695">And as I would show, the regulation’s main thrust is to impose upon poor women, the moral and religious opinions of various state officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.403" offset="8534058">Connecticut has asserted no state interest whatsoever which justifies this manipulation of a public benefit program in favor of child birth and against abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2120.080" offset="8584735">I would like to preface my replies to the Attorney General by invoking the framework used by this Court in considering the landmark case of Roe against Wade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.832" offset="8631756">That framework.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.101" offset="8636771">Now that there are two facets to any consideration of state action regarding abortion; one is our awareness of the very deep moral and religious and philosophical objections which many persons hold regarding abortion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.941" offset="8708138">The other facet, however, is that in resolving these questions, we must be guided by the constitution and we must make an effort to free ourselves of the emotions and prejudices of the past and the state in particular is obligated to act free of such prejudices.</text>
