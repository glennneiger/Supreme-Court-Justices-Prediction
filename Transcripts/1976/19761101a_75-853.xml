            <label>Mr. Macdonald Flinn</label>
            <text syncTime="50.249" offset="301479">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.198" offset="313286">This antitrust action is before this Court for the second time on Writ of Certiorari directed by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.653" offset="347141">In 1969, in a five to four decision, this Court reversed a summary judgment in favor of the present petitioners who are the defendants below.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.329" offset="389773">At the trial which followed in the Western District of Kentucky, a verdict was directed for the plaintiff on the liability issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.087" offset="420806">The jury found damages in the amount of some $93,000 before trebling and before the addition of counsel fees and costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.595" offset="454870">Upon appeal from that first trial, the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that while the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case of Sherman Act violations, nevertheless there were material facts in dispute and the liability issues as well as the damage issues should have been submitted to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.456" offset="526341">Upon remand at the second trial, however, both sides agreed to wave the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.636" offset="551001">Following that second trial, the trial judge signed a photocopy of the plaintiff’s proposed findings and conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.792" offset="579631">In adopting those conclusions, he held that the defendants had violated both Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.280" offset="609619">Upon the appeal from that second trial, the Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the plaintiff had in fact made out a prima facie case of a proceed time violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act, and that the findings adopted by the trial judge below were not clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.314" offset="685792">As the plaintiff urged, however, the Court of Appeals concluded, that having reach the results that it did with regard to the Section 1 findings, it was unnecessary on the appeal to determine whether or not the Section 2 finding of conspiracy to monopolize could be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.874" offset="752039">It is with the case in that posture that this Court has granted Certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.811" offset="771787">The plaintiff, Fortner Enterprises is a corporation owned by Mr. A. B. Fortner, a successful Louisville realtor.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.397" offset="806060">The defendants are US Steel, which through its Homes Division sold prefabricated houses and it is wholly owned finance subsidiary, US Steel Homes Credit Corporation which confined its financing services to promoting the sale of Homes Division Houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.003" offset="880457">By written agreements executed in the first instance in October 1960, and again in August 1961, Mr. Fortner negotiated with the credit corporation, certain land loans covering the acquisition and development of two neighboring parcels of land and a subdivision owned by another of Mr. Fortner’s corporations Viroqua (ph) Development.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.098" offset="984842">This financing was conditioned upon the agreement by the plaintiff to buy and construct a Homes Division, prefabricated house on each of the lots unless the underlying loans were repaid.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.878" offset="1040013">The amount committed under these loan agreements was 100% of the cost at which Mr. Fortner transferred the lots from one corporation to the other, plus the cost of development of some 150 lots which were involved in the first transaction and which were not fully developed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.127" offset="1117022">Mr. Fortner testified that he would not have purchased the defendant’s houses without this land financing which is the challenged subject in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.082" offset="1156832">Mr. Fortner also testified that only when the defendants had finally accepted his terms during extensive negotiations, did he agree to enter into this arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.994" offset="1204480">Fortner contends both below and here that this land financing, conditioned upon the purchase of the prefabricated houses was a per se time violation in that the loans were allegedly unique, because 100% loans on equally favorable, equally cheap terms were not available at that time from traditional Louisville lending sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.838" offset="1303849">More specifically, Mr. Fortner and other witnesses testified that to the best of their knowledge, 100% loans were not available from conventional lenders in Louisville at the particular time they entered into these two transactions with the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.753" offset="1367484">But as the Court of Appeals noted, soon after the plaintiff had negotiated its 100% terms with the defendants, conventional Louisville lending agencies did in fact begin to grant 100% land loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.240" offset="1425476">In fact, it is undisputed on this record that within less than a year of the second loan agreement, in response not only to the alleged terms which the Credit Corporation granted to the plaintiff here, but also in response to 100% loans by other prefabricated house manufacturers, the traditional Louisville lending agencies were indeed making 100% land loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.354" offset="1525890">We contend that Fortner has failed to make out a prima facie case of the requisite economic power over credit in order to establish a per se time violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.655" offset="1571134">In holding to the contrary, we respectfully submit that the courts below have failed to follow the mandate laid down by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.438" offset="1606243">The Court of Appeals, on the most recent appeal, held that even though Fortner had failed to prove that other lenders were in anyway prevented from making equally favorable or cheap loans, none the less the requisite economic power over credit could be and was held to be in this case established by solely three elements of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.460" offset="1694328">First, that the loans were allegedly cheaper or more favorable than available at that time from other sources in Louisville.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.202" offset="1725257">Second, based upon the opinion testimony of Fortner’s construction superintendent that the tied product price, the price of the houses charged by the defendants was allegedly higher than the price for a comparable conventional house, and finally mere acceptance of this tying condition in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.545" offset="1822641">I would turn now to what the petitioners believe this Court held was necessary to establish economic power over credit.</text>

            <text syncTime="438.769" offset="1855556">Mr. Flinn, before you do that, is it not correct that there was also at least representing opinion to an additional item approved, namely the fact that there were other times between your credit division and other purchases of Homes?</text>

            <text syncTime="456.066" offset="1924728">Mr. Justice Stevens, I believe that as correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.634" offset="1935072">I intended to subsume that holding by the Court in my statement of the third element, customer acceptance.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.552" offset="1958687">The plaintiff has contended that uniquely favorable loans were extended by the Credit Corporation to other borrowers.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.050" offset="1988676">We urge that there are absolutely no evidences or the records of the terms or conditions on which loans were made by the Credit Corporation to any other borrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.185" offset="2025247">We contended that there is nothing that shows that loans to any other borrower on land financing were especially unique in the sense, that equally favorable terms were not available from other conventional…</text>

            <label>Mr. Macdonald Flinn</label>
            <text syncTime="501.809" offset="2107689">The plaintiff has I think taken the evidence out of record.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.837" offset="2119810">We have treated this point in some detail in the Appendix and the reason that we have put it in the Appendix to our reply brief Mr. Justice, is because we are prepared to stand on our argument today whether or not other customers acquiesced in tie-in arrangements under uniquely favorable loan terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.426" offset="2194207">Our argument is as a matter of law, that the result is the same for reasons which I will go into in my argument, but we do take factual issue with the state of the record and have detailed the record in that.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="535.112" offset="2240914">Your point, just so I have clear mind, the customer acceptance feature of the proof is the same whether it is this customer or this customer is?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="macdonald_flinn" startTime="542.229" stopTime="933.677">
            <label>Mr. Macdonald Flinn</label>
            <text syncTime="542.229" offset="2269440">Mr. Justice Stevens, that is my argument today, yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.081" offset="2292845">Unlike a tie-in product which is unique or distinctive and commands a higher price or a premium price thereby yielding an abnormally high profit to the seller, credit or financing by contrasts is the most fungible of all commodities.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.053" offset="2372676">$1 is no different than any other dollar and no lender can long command a higher price or more owners or costly terms for selling his credit or his financing services than other lenders are asking.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.256" offset="2429518">In recognition to that fact, this Court, both the majority and the dissenting Justices stated that the only thing that can be unique about a loan or financing is that it is offered on cheaper or more favorable terms than other lenders are offering at the particular moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.341" offset="2497854">Indeed, such cheaper offering of terms is the very crux, the very essence of competition among lenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.462" offset="2534321">In recognition to that fact and in keeping with that desirable competitive objective, again, both the majority and dissenting Justices of this Court rejected Fortner’s argument that economic power over credit can be established solely by the fact that the terms offered are cheaper or more favorable than available elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.889" offset="2628049">In fact, both the majority and dissenting Justices recognized that without any economic power over credit, a lender can decide to offer more favorable terms in order to promote the sale of an ancillary or tied product.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.385" offset="2698057">Such a lender may simply decide to give up some or all of the profit which other lenders are making on the terms that they ask.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.928" offset="2732225">As Justice Black stated for the majority, a seller who lacks economic power in the credit market can lawfully offer advantageous terms on credit as a means of promoting the sale of his tied product, thereby in effect reducing the price of the tied product, engaging in price competition in the tied product market.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.503" offset="2818534">In short, this Court concluded that cheaper, more favorable terms for credit neither prove nor disprove the existence of economic power.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.517" offset="2862524">They merely pose the decisive question which must then be answered if in fact, the loan terms were cheaper or more favorable than available elsewhere, were they cheaper because the defendants had some unique economic ability, some unique competitive advantage which precluded other lenders from offering equally favorable terms on a profitable basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.502" offset="2966491">The issue mandated by this Court, therefore, was not whether equally cheap financing was merely unavailable from other lenders at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.171" offset="3009227">Rather as the majority held, unless other lenders were legally barred from offering 100% loan terms, the issue then is whether in the words of Justice Black, the defendants had a unique economic ability to provide 100% financing at cheap rates because they had some cost advantage or economies of scale in their credit operations, so that other lenders could not profitably lend money on the risks involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.687" offset="3127196">The Court of Appeals addressed itself to these factual issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.040" offset="3144646">It correctly concluded that there was no such proof in this trial record.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.485" offset="3162409">Many lenders were legally free not subject to any probations upon making 100% land loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.826" offset="3191771">Similarly, Fortner offered no evidence that the defendants had any cost advantage or economies of scale arising out of their operations in the credit market.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.869" offset="3232000">Instead, the record shows affirmatively that the defendants operated at a cost disadvantage and realized a lower rate of profit than conventional lenders did.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.135" offset="3277035">In fact, what the courts below found was that conventional lenders were not making 100% loans at the time of these transactions only because they were unwilling to take the risk of lower profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.324" offset="3337743">Now, as proof of economic power as I indicated a moment ago, both of the lower courts relied upon the evidence of the allegedly cheaper more favorable loan terms which are challenged here, coupled with the allegedly higher price for the tied product, the houses and customer acceptance of that tie-in arrangement in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.636" offset="3423007">We urge that even if these facts were submitted or supported by the record, they are not proof of power over credit.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.910" offset="3460101">Reduced to their lowest common denominator, they are at most consistent with or tend to support the claim that the terms on which the loans were offered were in fact cheaper or more favorable.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.718" offset="3515376">Proof of cheaper terms, however, as this Court held does not prove that the defendants had any unique ability to offer loans on such terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.905" offset="3552156">It does not prove that other lenders were precluded in any way in matching those terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.258" offset="3577547">Where the tie-in element is offered at a cheaper price, buyers will inevitably be attracted by that fact, particularly is that true where the tie-in element is fungible, such as money because no borrower, as we have noted, will pay other lenders a high price than he can obtain from some other lender.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.489" offset="3658423">In those circumstances, we urge that acceptance of the tie-in condition, even by numerous customers, attracted by the allegedly lower price of the financing, is at most evidence that the credit terms were in fact cheaper or more favorable.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.791" offset="3723624">It is not evidence of economic power.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.116" offset="3736999">Similarly, I assume that Mr. Fortner had believed that defendant’s houses were over priced or otherwise non competitive at the time he negotiated the loan arrangements which are now challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.987" offset="3788408">I would note that the evidence is to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.544" offset="3798648">Mr. Fortner’s disenchantment with the houses appears to have occurred many months after he had negotiated, requested and entered into the second loan arrangement but…</text>

            <text syncTime="957.467" offset="3930409">It makes a great deal with difference Mr. Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.755" offset="3939500">I believe that if at the time a buyer who enters into a tie-in arrangement, knowingly takes a product which he does not want, knowingly takes a product which is he believes is over priced, knowingly takes a product which he deems non competitive on any other basis, it can then be urged that on an inference that he has been economically coerced by some uniquely attractive singularly compelling aspect to the tie-in element and an inference of the economic power might be drawn from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.760" offset="4059559">Now, I am saying first of all in this case, the evidence shows affirmatively though no finding was made on this one way or the other that at the time, Mr. Fortner solicited and negotiated not one but two financing arrangements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.671" offset="4123193">He was in no way convinced that the houses were anything other than supportive, indeed as much as six months after the second loan arrangement, he stated in a letter that his principal competitor, Mr. Swindler, who had houses comparable to his, he was sure anybody who would look at the two houses would conclude that his US Steel Houses were both cheaper and better.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.992" offset="4212427">I submit Mr. Swindler in order to survive in the real estate business notwithstanding that unhappy name, must have had very good houses at very low prices, and I think that Mr. Fortner’s own characterization suggests that it was not until long after he had negotiated the loan agreements that he deemed these houses to be in anyway defective or overpriced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.763" offset="4291526">My point is solely that no inference of economic power can be drawn from any disenchantment with the houses, since that disenchantment did not arise until after the loan arrangements had been negotiated but in…</text>

            <text syncTime="1104.605" offset="4518896">Now, alternatively where the tie-in element is allegedly unique because offered on more favorable or cheaper terms than available elsewhere, the only way that a customer knowingly accepting the tie-in arrangement and knowingly accepting a higher priced tied product could evidence economic power would be if the premium or the over charge on the tied product, the houses exceeded the saving on the tie-in element and the evidence is devoid of any such evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.582" offset="4650867">It is directly devoid of any such evidence and I believe that the plaintiff makes no claims along those lines.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.829" offset="4727771">Even after two trials, there is no evidence here that traditional lenders were ever prevented by a cost disadvantage, legal obstacle or otherwise from making 100% loans at a profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.918" offset="4784196">Nevertheless ignoring this Court’s mandate, we urge the Court of Appeals held as I have noted previously, that Fortner could prevail even though it failed to show that other lenders were unable to make comparable loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.153" offset="4837067">We submit that the absence of such evidence by itself is sufficient to destroy Fortner’s per se tie-in claim in view of this Court’s mandate on the prior review of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.308" offset="4885760">Moreover, there is affirmative proof in the record that other lenders were not prevented from making equally favorable 100% loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.830" offset="4919823">As I have mentioned before, even though it was ignored by both the trial court and the Court of Appeals, the evidence is undisputed, that traditional lending agencies within a very few months began making 100% land loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.749" offset="4975516">The Court of Appeals incidentally in its first opinion had correctly concluded that that evidence was relevant to deciding whether other lenders were free and able to make 100% loans.</text>

            <text syncTime="1396.709" offset="5687301">However, the first opinion of the Sixth Circuit is not silent on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1404.318" offset="5717812">As I also noted, the courts below concluded that conventional Louisville lenders were not making 100% loans earlier only because of their unwillingness to take the risk involved or indeed as Fortner conceded in his brief before the Court of Appeals, because such conventional lenders would not take the chance if the loan is not being profitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1425.928" offset="5804225">We urge that the fact that competing lenders simply chose not to run the risk of lower profit until stimulated by competition to do so, demonstrate that they have the ability to offer 100% loans like those allegedly given by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.918" offset="5876114">In conclusion, we would ask the Court to consider the competitive consequences of Fortner’s position adopted by the courts below that economic power over credit is shown where equally favorable terms are merely unavailable and simply because other lenders choose not to run the risk of lower profit, that proposition would mean that the innovator who pioneers lower credit terms to promote the accompanying sale of a product violates the antitrust laws even though his competition stimulates other lenders to lower their prices for financing, a wholly desirable, laudable antitrust and competitive objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.553" offset="6058658">To sanction that position, we respectfully submit is simply to stand the Sherman Act on its head.</text>

            <text syncTime="1527.833" offset="6211840">My client said I understood that the Supreme Court had established the basic ground rules for this case eight years ago, did they not and I said, “Yes, I thought they had.”</text>

            <text syncTime="1596.758" offset="6487484">Mr. Justice White felt to a relatively simple level on the scale of things and that basically Judge Gordon at the close of our 30-day trial of this action, felt that we have proved not only all of the evidence which was in the record before this Court at that time, but quite a bit more and that since there was no evidence produced by United States Steel and the Credit Corporation who rebutt that that basically the prima facie case that Judge Gordon felt, Mr. Justice Black had delineated in this Court’s opinion had been and had not been properly rebutted, and therefore, he sustained the motion for direct verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="1666.751" offset="6767516">Now, this is at the time that he gave the directed verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.160" offset="6789146">One of the very interesting things about this is that what you have heard today and what you have read in the briefs, are great deal, are Mr. Flinn’s and his covert economic theories that are not supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.399" offset="6854138">But we have argued this case and we argued this case time and time again before Judge Gordon in the intervening eight years up to the time that we got here and he was quite familiar in great depth with all of the facts and all of the evidence that had been established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.192" offset="6937312">Judge Gordon was not impressed at all with the very meager evidence that had been presented for example about the subsequence events, involving basically the Lowable Mortgage Service Company (ph) and its president testifying that on a few occasions they had from their own company’s money made some 100% loans, but that those loans were not similar to the Fortner’s loans with which he was familiar and very importantly those loans involved personal guarantees by principals of the borrower which clearly made those loans distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.635" offset="7119020">Now, the only other testimony Mr. Flinn refers to undisputed evidence, that the only other testimony about 100% loans at a later time was some very general testimony, that was not pinpointed, but it is obvious that it involves loans made a number of years later at a time when we were in an inflationary spiral and in circumstances totally different than those which existed at the time these loans remain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.937" offset="7256215">The only expert in this field and he says, as Mr. Justice Rehnquist pointed out, the Judge Gordon was free to ignore or accept his testimony, but the only competent expert who testified in this case was Dr. Masten who had been with the University of Kentucky, who at the time of our last trial in the form of the supplemental evidence that we presented was that a professor of banking at the University of Georgia and Dr. Masten laid out the framework of the economics of this case for Judge Gordon and of course to judge it was quite obvious at the trial itself when Dr. Masten testified that Judge Gordon was very much impressed by Dr. Masten’s testimony which buttressed in many ways the arguments that we had previously made and I respectfully submit that many things that you have been hearing are Mr. Flinn’s economic theories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.906" offset="7504169">We give back to basic proposition that what you have heard today involves arguments as to facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.337" offset="7545861">As Mr. Justice Rehnquist pointed out in any earlier argument today, normally this Court does not when a District Judge acts as a fact finder, make fact determinations and when those fact determinations have been affirmed by the circuit court, this Court does not go behind those.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.765" offset="7631543">Basically it is our position that what Mr. Flinn is asking you to do is to go behind the court’s fact findings.</text>

            <text syncTime="1898.628" offset="7694968">First of all, the gist of petitioner’s argument is that this Court’s 1969 opinion indicated that the only way that we could establish economic power was to establish that the Credit Corporation had some cost advantage in what is described as the credit market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.056" offset="7800712">I would respectfully submit to start out with that and they rely very heavily on the concept of fungibility of money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.534" offset="7842612">I would point out to the Court that the record does not support this concept of fungibility when it is applied to loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.246" offset="7893498">This Court in the Philadelphia Bank case for example, pointed out that money is the raw material and that loans are the finished product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.508" offset="7946475">So we start out, and respectfully submit, with the basic proposition that you have loans on particular terms, not just cheap loans, because again, I submit that while the term, ‘Cheap’ is used, we are talking about loans that are on particular terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.615" offset="8018991">One of the unique aspects of the loans in question here was the 100% aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.106" offset="8044904">A 100% of the cost of acquiring the land and of developing it and of building the prefabricated house packages that were bought were loans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.406" offset="8090148">We are talking about $2,500,000 worth of loans to generate purchases of house packages of about $700,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="2378.914" offset="9616117">The problem was compounded by the – again, in talking about the creation of economic power, the problem was compounded in this situation by the fact that United States Steel itself guaranteed to the Credit Corporation the loans and I emphasize that we have two different separate corporate entities in this case not willing and that when they elected to operate under the separate corporate entity principals, they are bound by that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.339" offset="9741818">Now, in this situation, United States Steel Corporation and we have cited the figures in the brief with its vast resources, its retained earnings that it had in its kitty to use, put itself again in the same type situation as your creditory price cut in, by making available very necessary funds from other sources to recompense the Credit Corporation if it got into trouble in a particular loan such as it did with Fortner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.178" offset="9877237">So that what we have is if a bank were making a loan or a savings and loan association were making a loan to a developer and that bank or savings and loan association said development loan like this, $2,500,000 loan said to that developer, “You have got to buy United State Steels’ prefabricated houses.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2606.888" offset="10528000">The question is what was sufficient as their own documents pointed out that we have quoted in our brief, what is enough they said?</text>

            <text syncTime="2618.108" offset="10572930">How much is enough to get you to take our product and in some instances, it may have been 80%, in some instances it may have been 70%, in some instances it may have been 90% and in some instances it may be a 100%, but we do know this, this is an un-contradicted fact in the record, and is found by the court that all the loans that were made, I mean, all of the loans that were made whether under the special financing program or under the general financing program of US Steel contains a tie-in about which we are complaining here today and that is un-contradicted in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.696" offset="10735307">We do know that the special financing program which is described by their own documents was the program in which they deliberately set out to attain additional sales of house packages and we do know that there were 43 loans involving the special terms necessary to obtain sales in situations that were not otherwise generally acceptable and of those 43 loans we know that they involved $7,700,000 worth of loans, again involving the land acquisition and development aspects only of this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.759" offset="10899565">So it can be seen from the very record and the findings of the trial court that many, many other ties were created by this program and not just Fortner.</text>

            <text syncTime="2726.047" offset="11004682">Justice Black in the majority opinion in this case held in essence that this is evidence for the finder of fact to consider; the finder of fact considered that evidence and found it to be significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.447" offset="11058285">Mr. Justice Black said of these other factors that I have referred to were evidence to be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.205" offset="11093289">I did not read this Court’s opinion as a saying and nor has the Sixth Circuit in either of its opinions where this Court’s opinion as saying that the only way that you can prove market power in the lending situation is to prove some cost advantage on the part of the lender, because and I think if you analyze it, it is obvious that there are many other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.699" offset="11207288">There are many other pieces of evidence that can prove that economic power just as will is a cost advantage.</text>

            <text syncTime="3354.276" offset="13517557">They were spread over roughly a five-year period according to the face of the particular exhibit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.876" offset="13535947">That exhibit is dated in late 1962, it picks up loan commitments not even loans made Mr. Justice, but commitments made as early as 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.671" offset="13587147">These two loans that are listed on that particular document for Fortner enterprises show that the other listings were commitments rather than amounts actually loaned because of the record here clearly demonstrates Mr. Fortner did not take down full amount of the $380,000 land loans committed to him.</text>

            <text syncTime="3396.421" offset="13686204">I am sure the record does show that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.273" offset="13693623">No land financing was extended other than on the basis that each lot would have a Homes Division house built upon it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.685" offset="13723193">So we raised no issue about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.657" offset="13731134">We do, however, point out that the $19 million loan which my friend Mr. Anderson says was the tie is erroneous of that 19 million, some $13 or $14 million was for the purchase of the houses themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.730" offset="13791425">Those were not land loans, then when we get down to the roughly $5 million of land loans which were outstanding in one of the two years when these loans were negotiated, there is no showing on the record is that how many of those were special land loans and therefore by the plaintiff's argument allegedly unique in any sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.232" offset="13865404">The record is silent on those facts.</text>
