            <text syncTime="51.000" offset="304486">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.715" offset="315353">I am Joshua Kancelbaum arguing on behalf of appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.819" offset="327787">The appellants in this case are taxpayers of the State of Ohio, who are appealing a decision of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio which upheld the establishment clause validity of Ohio's latest statute which provides massive aid to the non public elementary and secondary education in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.189" offset="421201">The massive aid, I referred to amounts to funding of in-excessive $88 million for the biennial.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.091" offset="452862">This case presents variations on the theme explored in 1975 by this court in Meek v. Pittenger, and indeed the statute here challenged which is codified as Ohio, Revised Code Section 3317.06 and which we have generally referred to on a brief Senate Bill 170 was enacted in direct response to this court's decision in Meek v. Pittenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.834" offset="539797">At that time, we had an appeal pending before this court from the predecessor Ohio statute which was virtually identical to the one decided in Meek v. Pittenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.959" offset="580339">A few days after the Meek decision, this court remanded that appeal on the Ohio law for further proceedings and the response was the repeal of that law and the enactment of the present law.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.565" offset="622762">The current Ohio law provides following programs; Section A: Text Book Loans, Sections B and C: Material And Equipments Loans, Section D: Speech And Hearing Diagnostic Services, Section E, Physician, Nursing, Dental and Optometric Services which incidentally we do not challenge, Section F: Diagnostic Psychological Services, Section G: Therapeutic Psychological and Speech and Hearing Services; Section H: Guidance and Counseling Services, Section I: Remedial Services, Section J: Standardized Test and Scoring Services, Section K: Programs for the deaf, blind and emotionally disturbed, coupled, and physically handicapped and finally Section L: Field Trip Transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.284" offset="817635">It is our contention that acceptance so far as the narrow physically oriented health services are concerned, all of these programs follow the establishment cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.888" offset="860058">The essential pattern in this case which differentiates it from Meek v. Pittenger is basically that as far as equipment and material loans are concerned, the present law purports on paper to make these loans to pupils or parents rather than outright loans to the educational institution and in so far as the services are concerned, the services are now dichotomized so that diagnostic services are performed on the Parochial premises as they were under previous laws considered by this court whereas the so called therapeutic services are now moved at least some minimum distance beyond the walls of the non public schools.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="281.336" offset="1225773">And the speech and hearing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joshua_j_kancelbaum" startTime="284.868" stopTime="777.183">
            <label>Mr. Joshua J. Kancelbaum</label>
            <text syncTime="284.868" offset="1239983">Yes, Your Honor, those are the two categories of the diagnostic services we object to the speech and hearing and the psychological.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.333" offset="1269763">In our judgment, these services are materially different from the other diagnostic services and that they are far more subjective.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.195" offset="1305289">They are framed under the law in a very loose fashion which permits a large degree of unrestricted intercommunication between the diagnostician and the person receiving the diagnosis.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.716" offset="1367356">So that -- at the risk of skipping ahead for a moment, what we have is -- and the record is clear as far as psychological diagnostics are concerned, interviewing and projective procedures are specifically mentioned in the stipulation and guidelines and so far as these items are concerned what it amounts to is government employees evaluating the attitudes, behavior etcetera of children in a Church School and that this is fundamentally inconsistent with the Establishment Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.692" offset="1507268">Non public Education in Ohio as it has been where this court has considered similar types of Statutes arriving in other states, is overwhelmingly sectarian and in fact of some 262,628 nonpublic pupils enrolled in Ohio during the 1974-75 school year.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.811" offset="1631715">243,545 were enrolled in the Catholic schools, only 8700 were enrolled in Nonsectarian schools, of 720 non-public schools throughout Ohio only 29 were Nonsectarian.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.963" offset="1704336">The Court below determined that although there were perhaps some differences between the conduct of sectarian education Ohio and the profile which appeared in this Court's opinion in Meek v. Pittenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.442" offset="1774240">Sectarian Education in Ohio was substantially comparable to what this court found to be the situation in Lemon v. Kurtzman and indeed, this Court in affirming the successful challenges by these appellants of previous Ohio, measures to provide sectarian aid in Wolman v. Essex and Grit v. Wolman, which arose on similar stipulated records, in effect held that Sectarian Education in Ohio is subject to the same structures as applied in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and indeed appellees have considered that because of the religious mission of these schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.394" offset="1974024">They are defending the statue based upon its secularity and not upon any differences between Sectarian Education in Ohio and elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.644" offset="2015089">Turning to the Material And Equipment Loan provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.712" offset="2035360">There are essentially three distinctions between these provisions and the provisions considered by this court in Meek v. Pittenger.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.868" offset="2063990">First, there is a clause in the Ohio Statue which says that, 'Materials which are capable of diversion to religious purposes cannot be loaned.'</text>
            <text syncTime="500.406" offset="2102129">Secondly, there is the provision which I alluded to earlier that loans are to be made to pupils or parents and thirdly, unlike the previous statues in Marburger and Meek.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.203" offset="2145283">The implementation of the Equipment And The Material Loans is to be accomplished with the assistance of publicly paid staff which goes on -- which is authorized to go on to Parochial school premises to do such things as collect, catalog, distribute and store the equipment and materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.765" offset="2227516">Dealing with the first of these distinctions first, the Divertible To Religious Purposes clause, all that does is put this case in exactly the same posture as far as equipment And The Material Loans are concerned that Meek v. Pettinger was in, when it arrived at this Court, because the District Court in Meek v. Pettinger had already held that the Pennsylvania Act was invalid under the Establishment Clause and so far as it permitted equipment and materials which were capable of diversion to religious purposes to be so loaned.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.391" offset="2350083">What this Court did was strike down these provisions and so far as they authorized the lending of materials which was ostensibly of fixed neutral content on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.703" offset="2403268">Dealing with the loan concept, the pupil loan concept, we must first commence with the understanding that the very same equipment and materials which were to be loaned loan under the prior Ohio Act which were substantially the same as the equipment and materials which were to be loaned in Meek v. Pettinger are available under this enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.312" offset="2501698">The stipulated record contains a list of the items which were furnished under the prior Ohio Act and it is agreed that these same materials except to the extent that the incapable of the diversion clause can have some affect will be loaned again and these includes such items as wall maps, science labs, expensive pieces of electronic equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.513" offset="2602530">The point is that we are not simply handing out items which are the functional equivalent of textbooks here and the applicable principle, I think was well set by this Court in its consideration of Committee for Public Education v. Nyquist, when this Court determined that a mere conduit device saying that you are giving or lending the benefit to the pupils or to the parents does not suffice to evade the function and effect of the enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.511" offset="2750488">The Meek rationale which is equally applicable to this statute as it was to the Pennsylvania Statute considered in Meek v. Pittenger was that substantial aid and I am quoting from the Meek opinion now, on Page 23 of our brief, part of page seven, I am sorry 657 of the Meek opinion, "Substantial aid to the educational function of such schools, accordingly, necessarily results in aid to the sectarian enterprise as a whole."</text>
            <text syncTime="694.091" offset="2876816">This factor does not change whether you call this a loan to the pupils or whether you call it a loan to the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.012" offset="2900535">Now, we are left with the necessity of harmonizing this aspect of the case with Board of Education v. Allen and the textbook portion of the Meek opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.715" offset="2955288">Part of our burden is of course, to ask this Court to overrule those textbooks decisions, we have always felt that they were not in harmony with the other holdings of this Court under the Establishment Clause but it is not necessary to overrule Board of Education v. Allen to reach this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.082" offset="3036790">There are practical distinctions between the materials and equipment on the one hand and the textbooks on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.554" offset="3062703">First of all, there is a history in Ohio of lending textbooks to public school pupils as well as parochial school pupils, the applicable statute is section 3329.06 where in the Board of Education, treat the furnishing of textbooks of public school pupils as a loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.195" offset="3133234">There is no comparable statute for the treatment of material and equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.107" offset="3152878">In public schools as a loan to the pupils.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.691" offset="3167193">No one would ever think of calling these items collective loans to the pupils, a wall map a loan to the pupils, but for the evident necessity of getting around this Court's opinion in Meek.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="777.183" offset="3209198">Mr. Kancelbaum, what is the difference between a geography book and a map?</text>

          <turn speaker="joshua_j_kancelbaum" startTime="782.526" stopTime="859.796">

            <text syncTime="782.526" offset="3230618">Your Honor, first of all, I mean for these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.800" offset="3243680">For these purposes if the items such as a map is not given to the pupil to carry or about with him, to perhaps take home, there is something very stretched about the notion of calling it a pupil benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.240" offset="3317449">I agree, that it makes still more sense, as far as I am concerned and as far as the clients I represent are concerned to say that the textbook going to the core of religious education also are not be furnished in Parochial schools at state expense but it is not necessary to say that because the distinction remains valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.259" offset="3393518">Moreover, here we have a case where the statute broadly authorizes all kinds of materials and equipments to be furnished, the State Department of Education passes some guidelines, then throws the matter under the statute to the administrations of 600 and add some local school districts who may consult with the 33 field coordinators in the implementation of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.889" offset="3487977">The notion that the pristine distinctions we make here, will find their way in to what is actually done under this act, is I think not consistent with the facts.</text>

Healthy case recently, is a quasi autonomous body, to acquire personality and to equip classrooms and I might add that the -- should the court desire, I would be most happy to furnish a supplemental memorandum on this point, but there is no comparable statue for the lending of materials and equipment as opposed to text books.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.389" offset="4982076">Now, turning to the problem of the on-premises diagnostic services, I would have that remarks the which appellants made considering the psychological services apply at least to an extent, the speech and hearing services as well because the definition in the statue is unrestricted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1317.309" offset="5369733">To the extent that this type of therapeutic service program can be affected across the board as part of a genuine general program either in a public school or in a facility which is truly made available for that service to general community of which the parochial school pupils are a part, we do not object.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.027" offset="5460535">We do object to public facilities which really are not public facilities at all but are special satellite facilities furnished by the public for the special use of the parochial facilities, in effect public annexes to church schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="2014.557" offset="8158671">If in Meek, the educational functions and the sectarian functions of the sectarian schools are so inter-related, no way could be given to the educational without aiding the religious, we don't believe that that is true of a loan to the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.942" offset="8220215">The educational or special educational needs of the school child are different and distinct from the religious nation of the sectarian school he attend.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.089" offset="8264832">A child using a modern educational material or device which makes learning more interesting, will receive the same educational benefits from that material whether he attends a sectarian or a public school and a child who is deficient or behind in one or more subjects has the same educational need for a new modern educational material or device which is programmed for his individual study and learning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.391" offset="8394086">As we read the Nyquist case, which the plaintiffs rely on to show that since it could not be loaned to the school, it could not be loaned to the pupil, we believe is readily distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.433" offset="8446226">We believe that financial assistance is readily distinguishable from forum or aid in the form secular materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.199" offset="8477260">Aid in the form of the secular materials would go to the child and remain with the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.253" offset="8501502">Unlike, financial assistance it would not flow to the child, through the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.175" offset="8521146">In addition, we believe the reasoning in the Nyquist case, supports the validity of the instructional materials and equipments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.130" offset="8553015">In that case, the opinion contrasts Allen and Harrison by saying that the material involved were secular and were provided in common to all students in the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.264" offset="8597528">In this case, no material which is even capable of diversion to the sectarian use may be loaned and no materials may be loaned unless they are available to the public school students within the district.</text>

            <text syncTime="2253.419" offset="9114125">Mr. Chief Justice and the members of the court, I believe I would like to start by commenting that perhaps one of the saddest things with respect to this case is the possibility that if the true character of this Legislation would be obliterated by either a failure on our part to properly explain how it works or on the basis of assumed abuses in administration or assumed illegal applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.560" offset="9234706">We are sitting here talking about annexes to Catholic Schools or the Lutheran Schools or Jury Schools, when the law permits no such things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.584" offset="9266785">In briefs we talk about buying property from religious organizations and putting a mobile unit on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.686" offset="9291235">That can't happened under this act and unfortunately we are talking about the loans that don't take place under the Ohio Act because the Ohio Act calls for loans to pupils, materials and equipments that are used by the pupils and they can't be used for any purpose other than secular purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.639" offset="9354974">Now, that's what the Ohio Act is all about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.819" offset="9363751">I think, when we properly understand the Ohio Act, it reflects an honest, genuine, response to the concerns in Meek.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.480" offset="9398442">I submit to the Court, it reflects a faithful application of the principles enunciated in Meek and of the other, First Amendment cases as this Court has decided in the past decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.268" offset="9441492">If Counsel is permitted to assume any kind of abuse that they would seep at in a case, no State Statute can stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.906" offset="9480049">We would submit to the Court that when we talk about the Statute, we must talk about it, as it is described on its face, as we have stipulation of the intended administration and any reasonable inferences that could flow there from.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.447" offset="9526233">When we start talking about Speech and Hearing diagnostician inculcating religion, may it please the Court, I believe we are just the beyond the realism into absurdity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.376" offset="9577955">That is not what diagnostic work is all about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2636.983" offset="10648453">As I indicated previously, there are items of equipments and materials with the clerk's office that are described in the stipulation, the Court can proves and find if they are useable by the child and they are quite clearly secular.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.724" offset="10699340">Before I move on to another item, let me suggest to the Court and I know that difficult question was put to Mr. Martin, are you having a difficulty with distinguishing this for Meek in terms of materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.977" offset="10744375">I would submit to the Court that as I read Mr. Justice Stewart's opinion in Meek, as it looked at the lending of materials and as Mr. Justice Blackmun explained it in Reomer, they looked at three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.967" offset="10800382">The character of the recipient, the nature of the that which was lent and the resulting relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.728" offset="10827340">Looking at these three features, the Court in Meek said, number one, the character of the recipient is a religion pervasive institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.823" offset="10871748">The material itself is self pleasing and fixed content secular and third the relationship is between the State and religious organizations because it is a loan directly to a religion pervasive organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.786" offset="10919604">Now, in terms of an honest and genuine response to Meek, if you look at the those same three characteristics with respect to the material and equipment in this case, it is lent not to a religion pervasive institution, but to a child and if we start calling him a religion pervasive child, we have free exercise problems that are beyond this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.809" offset="10999748">So, in this case we loan the secular fixed content, equipment and materials to a nonreligious pervasive person, a child, a citizen just like anyone else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.507" offset="11042484">Number two, it remains fixed content and secular, it cannot be used for religious purpose and number three, if you want to determine, as Mr. Chief Justice indicated earlier whether there is indeed fact that lending of anything could conceivably be used for a religious purpose that is all you would have to do is check with the treasurer at the local public school district.</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.325" offset="11125763">He has an inventory of that which has been purchased and that which is lendable, you look at the inventory, you look at the catalogue and it is either divertible or it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2765.260" offset="11161498">So in order to please the Ohio program, the relationship is between public and public.</text>

            <text syncTime="2815.234" offset="11361387">Now, there is less of that, in this case, because public school determines the equipments that is going to be made available based upon what it makes available to its own children and then the contact between the public authority is when let's say a teacher, we have a child who is behind in multiplication and they would suggest to check out a Rotomatic and this is just a little tube with the program unit and they keep turning it around his questions and answers, the child goes to the clerk librarian and this can either be on the premises or if it is the public school close, he goes there, one or the other.</text>

            <text syncTime="3286.050" offset="13244711">This particular branch of the argument, I think is perhaps one of the most dangerous assertions that has been made before this Court in any of the First Amendment non public education cases, that has been before this Court in the last ten years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.733" offset="13291418">For now, we have the ultimate, not a religion pervasive school, not a religion pervasive building, but a religion pervasive child, a citizen who is marked because of the fact that he a Catholic or Lutheran, a Jewish or a Christian child and because of that fact and that alone he may not go to a public facility and get the same kind of neutral secular service that any other child in this community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.581" offset="13398834">If that proposition can be adopted, what about the Lutheran parent who gets social security?</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.720" offset="13423389">We know he does not get it because he is a Lutheran but he happens to be a Lutheran.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.843" offset="13435823">I would suggest to the members of the Court, that even though some of the clients I represent, whose children are Catholic, Lutheran, Christian or Jewish, to be sure they get therapy, they get speech and hearing therapy at a public facility, but they do not get it because they are Catholic, or Lutheran or Christian or Jewish, they get it because they are a child in need and they get it because they are a citizen just like any other child and I respectfully suggest to this Court that what we have in the Ohio program is a neutral program of assistance of secular assistance that applies to all in the community and applies alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.911" offset="13568107">Now to be sure if there is not enough room in the public school facility then the non public school child might get the service in, let us say in a library room rather than a public school classroom, we suggest that makes no difference in terms of Establishment Clause principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.900" offset="13632055">This court, Justice Douglas in the Zorach case, when the non public school pupils were released from a public school, they go to attend a religious instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.924" offset="13664133">Justice Douglas pointed out, the Establishment Clause does not require such hostility that we can make no accommodation whatsoever for these children, so the release time program was approved there, I would suggest that the mere fact, that the Lutheran or Catholic or Jewish child receives his speech and hearing therapy in a library room rather than a public school because the public school does not have room or is not close enough makes absolutely no difference from an Establishment Clause of view point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3422.597" offset="13790880">I would submit to the Court that I think we have here in this Ohio program first of all we pointed out.</text>

            <text syncTime="3584.881" offset="14439970">Yes, Your Honor, in fact I recall that you have already decided a map case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3593.235" offset="14473407">Turning away from the example, the fact is that the statute, the guidelines, the stipulation are all silent as to the notion that only items capable of individual used by pupils are to be loaned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.518" offset="14550520">We think another area where adverse counsel has proved too much lies in the fact that we have before us clearly is the opportunity for the creation of a public lending library in a Parochial school, we think that little argument is involved in stressing the notion, if there is fundamentally inconsistent with the Establishment Clause in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.168" offset="14633172">Finally, we do not label children as sectarian children because they leave a Church school to go to a secular service off premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="3657.871" offset="14731915">As far as the influence upon the secular personnel is concerned, it is not the little child who is going to create a sectarian influence upon the supposedly secular personnel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3693.595" offset="14874857">We submit that there is nothing surprising under the Establisment Clause that aid to Secetarian schools cannot be funded by the state.</text>
