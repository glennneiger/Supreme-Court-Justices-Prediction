            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="12.959" offset="152361">This case comes to us on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.163" offset="177125">It concerns the “key man” system employed in the State of Texas for the selection of grand juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.908" offset="208158">Jury commissioners are appointed by the State District Judge and then the judge proceeds to test their qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.403" offset="238043">Among other things, the grand jurors must be of sound mind and good moral character and be literate, have no prior felony conviction and be under no pending indictment or other accusation.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.979" offset="288407">The respondent, Mr. Partida, was convicted of a crime in a Texas State Court and he claimed discrimination in the selection of the grand jury that indicted him.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.354" offset="337935">After he had exhausted his state remedies, he filed a habeas petition in the federal court based upon alleged gross under representation of Mexican-Americans in the county grand juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.552" offset="402718">The federal court concluded that Partida indeed have made out a prima facie case of invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.672" offset="435215">It also concluded, however, that the case was a weak one as it described it and concluded that its doubts about the reliability of population and grand jury statistics, coupled with the thought that Mexican-Americans constituted a governing majority in the county, caused it further to determine that the prima facie case had been rebutted and the petition therefore was dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.491" offset="546496">The Fifth Circuit reversed holding that the State had failed to rebut the prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.154" offset="577112">In an opinion filed today, we review at some length the statistical and other evidence that shows the county population to be 79% Mexican-American, or if one would exclude those under 25 and those who are illiterate as still 65% Mexican-American.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.516" offset="686513">But at over an 11-year period, only 39% of those summoned for grand jury service were Mexican-American.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.410" offset="722144">We conclude, that the proof offered by the respondent, did demonstrate a prima facie case and thus, we agree with both courts below and that the State, however, failed to rebut this by competent evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.497" offset="782434">All the State offered by way evidence was the testimony of the State District Judge dealing with the selection of the commissioners and the instructions he had given them.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.190" offset="825275">The Court did not call the jury commissioners to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.578" offset="842830">Without evidence about the method by which the commissioners determine the qualifications for grand jurors, no inference explaining a significant disparity can be drawn from the statistics about the population as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.979" offset="900403">We also hold that the District Court's so-called governing majority theory did not dispel the presumption of an intentional discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.354" offset="945856">We do not resume, as a matter of law, that human beings of one definable group will not discriminate against other members of that group and we therefore affirm the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.464" offset="1014297">I should point out that the Court is closely divided in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.476" offset="1030389">Joining the opinion are Justices Brennan, White, Marshall and Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.588" offset="1054839">I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice Marshall, while joining the opinion of the Court, has filed a separate concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.203" offset="1085246">The Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion joined by Mr. Justice Powell and Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.002" offset="1112518">Mr. Justice Stewart has filed a short dissenting statement and Mr. Justice Powell joined by the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist has also filed an opinion in dissent.</text>

          <heading>Opinion Announcement of Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</heading>
          <turn speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="267.644" stopTime="495.708">
            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="267.644" offset="1171032">In every previous grand jury discrimination case reaching this Court, the situation has involved a governing majority in the community with the resulting power over the selection of grand juries by an Anglo-American electorate, an Anglo official.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.629" offset="1259012">In these prior cases, we have sustained claims of grand jury discrimination against politically powerless minorities where they were totally excluded from or limited only to a token participation on grand juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.476" offset="1326408">The facts of this case are all together different.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.180" offset="1341246">Here, we have a Mexican-American defendant, duly convicted by a petty jury, who claimed discrimination in the selection of the grand jury that indicted him, but the defendant was not a member of a minority group.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.621" offset="1398924">He was indicted and convicted in Hidalgo County, Texas, a community in which 79% of the population and a majority of their elected officials also are Mexican-American.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.189" offset="1457230">The key actors in this drama were not Anglos.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.953" offset="1472276">They were Mexican-Americans, the judge who appointed the jury commissioners and who later presided over the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.408" offset="1502160">Three our of five jury commissioners, five of the 12 grand jurors who returned the indictment, seven of the 12 petty jurors who found respondent guilty, and the majority of the persons on the grand jury list in the year of respondent's indictment, all were Mexican-American.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.435" offset="1578229">I emphasize that a majority of the grand jury commissioners, who under Texas law, select the grand jurors were Mexican-Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.233" offset="1621383">Thus, Mexican-Americans controlled both the selection of the grand jurors and the entire political process.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.086" offset="1656805">In these circumstances, the rational inferences from the most basic facts in a democratic society render wholly improbable, respondent's claim of purposeful discrimination in the selection of grand jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.332" offset="1725768">There is, for me, a sense of extraordinary unreality when justices here in Washington decide that Mexican-Americans, who control the levers of power in this remote border community, are manipulating those levers to discriminate against their fellow Mexican-Americans.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.326" offset="1817824">In contrast, the judges, not in Washington but those on the scene, the state judges who appointed the jury commissioners, the state judge who presided over respondent's trial and the United States District Judge, both Mexican-Americans, familiar with the community perceived not basis for respondent's claim of invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.527" offset="1922627">A quash decision today releases one Mexican-American defendant whose guilt determined by a jury that included its seven Mexican-Americans is not questioned in this case, but I am not concerned particularly by the result of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.188" offset="2005278">I am concerned by the holding that statistical disproportionality is a law insufficient to invalidate indictments and subsequent convictions, the implications of this unprecedented holding may be far reaching indeed.</text>
