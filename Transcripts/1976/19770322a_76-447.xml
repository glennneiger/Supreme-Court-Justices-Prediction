            <label>Mr. Frank J. Kelley</label>
            <text syncTime="41.403" offset="266037">Mr. Chief Justice Burger, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.345" offset="289861">We are here appearing on behalf of the petitioners in this cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.196" offset="313266">The Court might recall that I was here some three years ago on this school desegregation case, regarding the question then of whether the lower court had exceeded their authority in ordering an inter-district remedy in the absence of an inter-district violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.941" offset="392261">In reversing this Court at that time held that the constitutional right of the plaintiffs was to attend a unitary school system within the City of Detroit, and remanded the case for formulation of a decree to eliminate the segregation that existed within that city.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.045" offset="464672">Following the remand and pursuant to the order of the District Court, the plaintiffs and the Detroit Board of Education each filed a desegregation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.774" offset="507617">The plaintiffs plan dealt solely with pupil reassignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.772" offset="523604">It contained no educational components.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.698" offset="535307">As a matter of fact, during the plaintiffs expert testimony in the remedy stage, their expert testified that the plaintiffs plan would in fact eliminate the segregation plan which is just in Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.197" offset="585253">On the other hand, the Detroit Board of Educations plan in addition to recommending proposing pupil reassignment for the first time included Cert.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.680" offset="627154">13, so-called Educational Components at a projected cost of $13 million annually to its plan, and that the Detroit Board in addition demanded that the cost of these expanded Educational programs be paid by the petitioners, who are State officials in the State of Michigan, in the Executive Branch of Government and the money come from unappropriated State funds.</text>

            <text syncTime="163.497" offset="754422">Do you think you would have any -- the State officials would have any standing here if the Detroit Board had agreed with the District Court’s order, and the District Court’s order it sort of sought to impose no financial burden on the State officials?</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank J. Kelley</label>
            <text syncTime="180.194" offset="821296">Probably not Mr. Justice, the plaintiffs at the time that the Detroit Board of Education made this recommendation in their plan responded to the Court by pointing out, the plaintiffs himself pointing out, that in the findings there were no violations with respect to educational components.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.413" offset="910112">Now yet in November of 1975 the court, the lower court then entered its order concerning pupils reassignment.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.032" offset="944594">A desegregation plan involving some 27,000 students in 105 schools out of 300 zone schools in Detroit.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.679" offset="979180">This desegregation plan was peacefully implemented in the second semester of January 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.662" offset="1011154">We submit for the purpose of the remedy in this cause, based on the last time we were here that the implementation had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.538" offset="1046576">Yet on May 11 of that year 1976, the District Court entered another order and its judgment directed that there be ten educational components to be put into effect system-wide in September of 1976, and each year thereafter for the expanded educational components of reading, guidance counseling, testing and in-service training.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.716" offset="1139363">And the Trial Court ordered the State, the petitioners, to pay half of the excess cost of implementing the systematic expansion of existing educational components from unappropriated funds of the State Treasure.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.353" offset="1205923">Now pursuant to the Court’s order, the Detroit Board disclosed that for the previous years 1975, 1976 it had spent $75 million on these four components.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.037" offset="1252629">It also pointed out that the expanded order of the Court as to these four components would cost the excess of $11.6 for the 1976, 1977 school year.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.335" offset="1301844">Then on August 4, 1976, the Court of Appeals in Cincinnati affirmed the lower court, compelling the system-wide expansion of existing educational programs to be financed with additional unappropriated funds from the State Treasury.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.314" offset="1361717">After on successfully seeking a stay, on October 18, 1976 the State Treasure of Michigan, issued a warrant to -- in the amount of $5.8 million of unappropriated State funds in the State Treasury and paid the same to Detroit Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.703" offset="1435278">Now, in affirming the District Court, the Court of Appeals did so and I quote, “Without prejudice to the right of the District Court to require a larger proportion of payment by the State of Michigan, if found to be required by future developments”.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.649" offset="1495046">And it is this judicially decreed blank check to be filled in each year and presented for payment of unauthorized funds upon the treasury of the State of Michigan that we are asking this Court to reverse.</text>

            <text syncTime="383.410" offset="1634122">Mr. Chief Justice, I believe that because of the factor that there was no adjudication in this case of any violation, any constitutional violation, with regard to educational programs in the Detroit School system that as soon as the lower court in its remedy got into educational components it was beyond its jurisdiction and in violation of the principles of this Court as laid down in Swann in every succeeding case thereafter, including the last time I was here when the Court at there exceeded its remedy.</text>

            <text syncTime="489.090" offset="2056783">I also feel that in this, that the act of the Court here is also doing violence to the principle of federalism as laid down in the Arvizu case.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.189" offset="2097221">I also feel that it is doing -- it is in-volitive of the decisions with regard to the Tenth and Eleventh Amendment also in this matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="590.556" offset="2462726">The second part, I do not believe that this is an exception under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, where the court could come in and compel payment of money from a State Treasury for some inequity found.</text>

            <text syncTime="2813.465" offset="11354285">And a further finding that it was necessary to engage in these remedial components in order to balance that out, I thought he said, yes, if there had been such a finding that would be s different case from the one here and then I put to him the question, is not the approval by the district courts of the plan submitted by the Board of Education, not conceived by the District Judge but by the Board of Education, is not his approval the equivalent of a finding on that score.</text>

            <text syncTime="3081.717" offset="12427291">The respondents, Ronald Bradley urge that the judgment of the Court of Appeals be affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.901" offset="12460101">Before sending forth the reasons for urging that affirmants, I should like to dispose off two assertions that have been repeated in the briefs and in argument here by the State petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.733" offset="12531363">First, that the Detroit school system is now unitary and second, that the respondents have been in our oppose to educational adjuncts as part of a desegregation plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.034" offset="12596564">Let me first observe that the Detroit school system is not unitary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.456" offset="12626344">The sixth circuit reversed in part and remanded the pupil reassignment portion of the opinion, in so far as it left untouched three regions in the Detroit school system that were contained over 100 schools that were all black.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.537" offset="12706592">Sixth Circuit said that this situation is intolerable, they recognize it is a difficult problem, but the District Court would have to deal with this problem, it could not leave those schools with these 100 black schools with their students located in the heart of the section of Detroit, which represented the very essence of the violation to go untouched.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.851" offset="12803872">Secondly, it totally misrepresents the respondent’s position to assert, that respondent’s have been opposed to these educational adjuncts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.458" offset="12846295">It is necessary to I think understand the dynamics of the remand proceedings to have a correct understanding as to what took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.076" offset="12896763">The District Court had a pre-occupation with the cart rather than the horse.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.220" offset="12933335">There was undo attention we felt at that time being placed upon the educational adjuncts and ignoring of the primary element of a remedy which was the desegregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.291" offset="12981609">These are adjuncts, not the primary element of relief and we had to continue to refocus the Court’s attention and the attention of all the parties on the fact that this was a Brown violation and the essential remedy had to be pupil reassignment, elimination of the discrimination of the segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.322" offset="13057782">And secondly, as an ancillary matter we had to deal with curing the effects, the lingering effects of that primary discrimination in the primary of segregation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3251.785" offset="13107624">The State petitioners take one line out of the cross examination response of one of our experts, Dr. Foster, and escalate that to our primary position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.630" offset="13147016">I think it is necessary for us to set that record straight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3264.788" offset="13159660">It will be preposterous, be ludicrous, absurd, hypocritical, and a reflection of the continued concern we have had for the evils of segregation that was addressed in Brown for the respondents to be challenging the inclusion of educational components in a desegregation plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="3504.401" offset="14118040">It goes on to note that Congress has provided in 20 U.S.C. 1703 that no state may deny equal educational opportunity by failing to take affirmative steps to remove the vestiges of discrimination.</text>
