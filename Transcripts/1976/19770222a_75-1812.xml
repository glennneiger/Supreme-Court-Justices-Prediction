            <text syncTime="45.747" offset="283490">Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.071" offset="296760">The issue before the court in this case today concerns the constitutionality of the Delaware's sequestration statute as it was applied to seize the property of some 21 nonresident defendants in an action having no substantial relationship to the state of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.033" offset="368649">This is an appeal, on the decision of the Delaware Supreme Court upholding that application of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.843" offset="399891">This is a shareholder’s derivative suit brought by the holder of one share of stock of the Greyhound Corporation against some 28 individual defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.709" offset="439284">The action is alleged to be brought on behalf of Greyhound and its subsidiary Greyhound Lines, Inc., both of which have their principal places of business in Phoenix, Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.477" offset="482334">The Greyhound Corporation is a Delaware Corporation. Greyhound Lines, Inc. is incorporated in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.593" offset="510859">Now, the individual defendants are 28, present or former officers, directors or in some cases employees of either one or the other of those companies.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="113.964" offset="556312">Do each one of the 28 fulfill what you have just stated either an officer or a Director or a key employee?</text>

            <text syncTime="122.816" offset="591735">Now, that is why I tried to put it in conjunctives.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.594" offset="598840">Some are officers, some are directors, and some are both.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="128.657" offset="615140">But all are one or the other?</text>

            <label>Mr. John R. Reese</label>
            <text syncTime="131.415" offset="626112">That is right.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.655" offset="643144">Some of them hold no position with the Delaware Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.518" offset="658504">It is worth noting that at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.261" offset="669475">Some of the individual defendants have only held positions with the California Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.998" offset="692463">As I said, none of the defendants is a resident of the State of Delaware, neither is the plaintiff incidentally.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.507" offset="718481">So as far as the record in this case shows no defendant has ever been in Delaware or done any act in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.707" offset="747320">The conduct charge against them in a complaint occurred far from Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.879" offset="768009">The essence of those charges is that the individual defendants ought to be held liable for the reason that the companies were found have violated a court order and because the companies suffered an adverse verdict in antitrust case, that is still on appeal and not yet final.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.104" offset="840943">But those charges are not before court.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.055" offset="848675">Today the issue is whether the Delaware sequestration statute can constitutionally be applied to sequester the defendant’s stock as means for coercing their general appearance in the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.883" offset="908025">Now, Delaware has no long arm statute applicable to individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.515" offset="922549">None of these defendants was personally seized with -- served with process.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.269" offset="941566">Instead the plaintiff obtained an ex parte order from the Court of Chancery in Delaware, seizing any property that the defendants had in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.113" offset="976884">In this case the property seized consisted primarily of capital stock issued by a Delaware Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.535" offset="1002588">The seizure was affected by an order to the corporation directing it not to affect any transfers of those shares on its books.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.974" offset="1036339">The certificates themselves were not seized and they could not be seized because they are not in Delaware either.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.523" offset="1062566">Delaware accomplishes the seizure.</text>

            <text syncTime="1485.682" offset="6043176">We submit that case of Ownbey against Morgan does not support the decision below either and it is for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.666" offset="6075150">First, Ownbey really did not address question that is presented to this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.843" offset="6091868">The validity of the attachment of the defendant’s property was not really in issue in Ownbey to the extent the Court there assumed that that attachment was valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.402" offset="6146099">The appellants submit that the assumption is out of touch with the procedure of due process concept that this court has developed and articulated in approximately 60 years since Ownbey was decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.871" offset="6203986">At the time Ownbey was decided, it may well have been that an attachment to secure jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant was the only way you could get jurisdiction over him, but as Mr. Justice Stewart pointed out, since International Shoe was decided about 30 years ago, there has no longer been a valid assumption and to put it simply we think that Ownbey reflects a time and the stage of analysis of the constitution that has been superseded.</text>

            <text syncTime="1593.695" offset="6475241">The issue before this court is whether the present use of the Delaware sequestration statute in the case at Bar has deprived these appellants of their Fourteenth Amendment rights under the United States constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.603" offset="6530935">The appellee Arnold Heitner is attempting secure access to a forum so that this case may proceed on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.510" offset="6562490">Jurisdiction is the appellee’s sole concern and that is all that this case is about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.969" offset="6584329">In this respect the seizure in the case at Bar is quite different from the seizures involved in recent attachment cases decided by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.367" offset="6621945">I am of course, referring to Sniadach and Fuentes and the cases which have followed those very important decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.661" offset="6651098">In those cases, ‘in personam’ jurisdiction over the defendant already existed. Here the Delaware statute can only be used if the defendants are nonresidents of the State of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.188" offset="6697178">In addition, in those attachment cases, the purpose of the attachment was to secure or to obtain property, security for the underlying judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.336" offset="6741795">In the case at bar, the appellee has no interest in the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.968" offset="6756319">As soon as the appellants appear, their property will be released. Now, throughout the appellant’s argument, they have maintained that the procedures used in this case are fundamentally unfair and the traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice have been violated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2452.446" offset="9910239">Also consistent with our system of federalism, Delaware has sought to counter balance these liberal corporate revisions, and its corporate law by enacting a sequestration statute which asserts the function of many cases calling corporate offices to account for their activities in connection with the operation of their performance, their duties of a Delaware corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2715.334" offset="10961824">In other words, no new causes of action can be interjected into the action by the virtue of the fact of the general appearance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3121.073" offset="12584760">I think that under the circumstances, you have to look at what the property interest is and what the function of the hearing would be and under these circumstances I think that the sufficient safeguards exist within the Delaware statute to cover this point.</text>
