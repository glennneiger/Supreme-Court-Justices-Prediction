            <text syncTime="70.571" offset="282227">I wish to reserve five minutes for rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.598" offset="294348">This case concerns the proper relationship between federal and state law in the obscenity area.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.329" offset="325277">Petitioner submits that this case can be simply disposed of and the constitutional issues avoided by the logical interpretation of the federal statute as being intended to support state policy and thus as incorporating the state law definition of obscenity in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.173" offset="420676">The petitioner, Jerry Lee Smith was convicted by a jury in the Souther District of Iowa and sentenced to six months imprisonment under the federal statute proscribing the mailing of obscene matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.802" offset="479190">He was convicted for mailings which took place solely within the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.268" offset="504999">These mailings were lawful within Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.424" offset="521613">Iowa law permits the distribution of all sexually related material to Iowa adults prescribing solely the distribution of certain specified materials to minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.570" offset="578247">The case here involves no distribution to minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.910" offset="591621">The distributions involved were made exclusively to postal inspectors who directly solicited the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.870" offset="631432">Hence, these distributions were totally permissible under the law of the state in which they took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.686" offset="662674">At trial, the Government offered no evidence of any contrary standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.551" offset="686184">Nonetheless, the Court permitted the jury to determine for itself what were the community standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.263" offset="713038">We submit this was error.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.812" offset="723174">The federal statute should be construed in the present circumstances as incorporating Iowa law as the measure of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.755" offset="759014">That statute precludes as a matter of law any finding that the materials involved here are obscene.</text>

            <text syncTime="279.930" offset="1119713">The federal statute here at issue was enacted in 1873.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.560" offset="1146149">The statute was enacted with almost no debate, it contains no statement of purpose, and it provides no definition of what is obscene matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.092" offset="1196304">The statute has subsequently been reenacted on a number of occasions but it has never been significantly revised, substantially debated, and no definition of the meaning of obscene matter has ever been provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.733" offset="1254922">Instead, the Congress has left that matter to judicial resolution by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.013" offset="1283971">This Court in the Miller decision and those that have followed has firmly stated that the issue of obscenity is one of local concern, not national concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.806" offset="1335171">Within the traditional state jurisdiction, the Court has rejected any need for national uniformity in this area and stated that the obscenity or non-obscenity of materials should be measured by contemporary community standards within the community in which the distribution has its effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.199" offset="1428793">In that the state legislatures are institutionally the voice of the people for setting community standards, the Court has recognized that the individual states have considerable latitude in determining what their community standard shall be.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.556" offset="1498175">Indeed, the Court has expressly recognized that states have the option of doing precisely what the State of Iowa has done here.</text>

            <text syncTime="431.741" offset="1726903">And in those circumstances, the remedy for the disagreement that any -- that the community and the legislatures would have in those circumstances would be the ballot box.</text>

            <text syncTime="1500.122" offset="6000431">The -- Mr. Chief Justice in the Miller case, in rejecting the national standards approach expressly stated that there will be varying from community to community standards of precisely -- and I'm quoting from page 30 of the opinion, “Of precisely what appeals to the prurient interest or is patently offensive.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.691" offset="6110668">The history of the formulation of the patent offensiveness test further confirms this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.542" offset="6134073">In that -- when it was first fully articulated by Mr. Justice Brennan in the Memoirs case, he stated that material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description of representation of sexual matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.498" offset="6201992">Hence, within the Court's own formulations and moreover within the logic of why it is that you prescribe obscenity is where it is offensive to the community.</text>

            <text syncTime="1569.045" offset="6276180">The result that occurred below and as urged by the Government expressly has certain adverse consequences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.104" offset="6316408">First, it effectively nullifies Iowa law and by the same logic, the laws of at least six other states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.153" offset="6356532">The Court has recognized in Lamont versus Postmaster General that the U.S. mails have a predominant influence in the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.034" offset="6400104">Whatever the Court stated, whatever may have been the voluntary nature of the postal system in the period of its establishment, it is now the main artery through which the business, social, and personal affairs of the people are conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1613.018" offset="6452036">Hence, the federal statute would become the dominant statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.613" offset="6466351">Indeed, in the circumstances here, that result runs directly contrary to what the Court has repeatedly stated is the right of the individual state legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.105" offset="6516402">Two, take the course followed by the State of Iowa and to choose to permit the regulation, the distribution of all sexually related material to their citizenry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.844" offset="6579304">The further adverse consequence of this decision, and we would submit that the -- that this constitutional issue of notice can be avoided by the interpretation of the statute which we submit is the fundamental fairness consideration that a person has a legitimate expectation that if he conducts himself in accordance with the laws of his -- the state of his residence, his conduct there will not lead him to criminal prescription.</text>

            <text syncTime="1879.390" offset="7517518">The material involved in this case consists of five magazines, five photographs, and two films which petitioner deposited in the mails that they were all sent to addresses within the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.930" offset="7583660">The case was tried to a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1899.452" offset="7597767">The defendant put on evidence of community standards which consisted largely of photographs and magazines of a similar in nature to the material which is alleged to be obscene here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2779.611" offset="11118341">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.774" offset="11135060">Well, we -- there was a question about the scope of the federal responsibility here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.589" offset="11154286">Now, I have said that what we've got when a state decriminalizes obscenity, is a difference in policy between a -- the federal policy and the state policy, each has a responsibility of its own under the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.713" offset="11222831">The federal responsibly in this case rests on the postal power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.590" offset="11238296">That power extends to both interstate and intrastate mailings and it may be exercised for the nation as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.352" offset="11273404">In exercising it, Congress may -- and we think in 18 U.S.C 1461 has adopted a nationwide prohibition barring obscene matter from the mails, whether mail interstate or intrastate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.030" offset="11324082">As a constitutional matter, that test is subject in the determination -- that statute in the determination of obscenity is subject to the contemporary community standards element.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.067" offset="11368176">But it is not subject to any sort of state interpositions between the people of the state and federal law governing the mails and it's not subject to any sort of local option.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.836" offset="11423242">And this is primarily because a state statute while it is evidenced of -- of the mores of -- of the community is not conclusive on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.018" offset="11460023">Like any state legislature concerned about matters in its sphere of responsibility Congress may determine that certain activities are pernicious.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.696" offset="11502759">Now, petitioner's suggestion that is applied to hard core pornography, this is somehow inconsistent with our federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.812" offset="11531180">Therefore requires that the statute be read to create a local option exception, simply turns federal -- federalism upside down by making state legislatures supreme over Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.284" offset="11577051">Congress could make federal obscenity law subject to state law, it hasn't done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.912" offset="11607562">When it wishes to do so, it does so expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.804" offset="11619161">This statute which dates from 1872 has been uniformly construed to apply across the nation as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.643" offset="11642567">It is part of a pattern of statutes expressing the federal interest in the limitation of the distribution of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2919.614" offset="11678407">A material cannot be imported even though the importer lives in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.748" offset="11694916">The material cannot be carried by a common carrier to a resident of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.403" offset="11725531">It can't be transported for purposes of sale or distribution there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2935.698" offset="11742772">And under the -- under this statute, it cannot be mailed at all in Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.783" offset="11771089">Iowa, if it wishes can permit the distribution of this material by not making it a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.276" offset="11797002">It's Iowa's business and Iowa's responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.505" offset="11805989">The Federal Congress, if it wishes, can also bar the material from the mail either interstate or intrastate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.932" offset="11851651">Now the petitioner claims that the statute is unduly vague and is applied to the facts in this case, while in Hamling, the Court clearly indicated what the statute applies to, hard core pornography.</text>
            <text syncTime="2976.126" offset="11904418">Petitioner was distributing hard core -- core pornography within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.675" offset="11926674">He was not committing a crime under state law but he was certainly on notice that he was committing a crime by distributing it by mail and that is what he was convicted for quite properly.</text>

            <text syncTime="3046.289" offset="12185078">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.309" offset="12197198">I believe I was responding to a question from Mr. Justice Stevens concerning whether the Court in this case should reach the question of overbreadth and I -- my answer, as I stated then was that, in this case, there is no reason for the Court to reach the issue of overbreadth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.239" offset="12284865">In this case, the facts involved show clearly that the defendant is within the scope of the statute as it was construed in Hamling, the statue, 18 U.S.C. 1461 was construed in Hamling to be confined to patently offensive hard core materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.493" offset="12381936">That is what is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.337" offset="12389251">That is what the petitioner mailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.463" offset="12397819">He was on notice from the time that the Roth decision came down that if he mails such materials, he would be violating federal law so there is no reason to be concerned with any question of overbreadth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.790" offset="12463125">Now, there has been some discussion about what the Court of Appeals is to consider in reviewing one of these decisions, the Court in Hamling noted that a juror was entitled to call upon his own knowledge of community custom -- the customary candor in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.320" offset="12569182">This decision -- that this kind of determination was compared to a knowledge of what reasonable conduct is, what standard of due care is, and that's about all you can do in this area when you're trying to determine what community mores are to be sure, a defendant is entitled if he wishes to introduce evidence concerning what community mores are but it is not mandatory that the government do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.648" offset="12686524">The jury -- the juror's knowledge is very much analogous to the reasonable man standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.589" offset="12714318">This comes into play also when we consider the last issue which petitioner presented in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.362" offset="12745352">That his -- his rights were violated by the voir dire of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.930" offset="12763638">Now of course, the questions to be put to jurors in an obscenity case must assure that the jurors are neutral and objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.433" offset="12805642">It's been said that -- it's appropriate to inquire within the limits of the judge's -- district judge's power to control voir dire into the political moral and religious or sexual opinions which might affect neutrality and objectivity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.162" offset="12876591">But the questions that the defendant here wished to propound to the jury were essentially, what do you know about community standards, where did you learn it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.135" offset="12916506">Do you know about the Iowa statute here?</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.277" offset="12925074">That's part of what the jurors have to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.531" offset="12938031">The petitioner can put in evidence on that issue as he did but he can't question the jurors about their understanding of these matters any more than he can question them about their knowledge of the case but the knowledge of standard of due care.</text>

            <text syncTime="3250.318" offset="13001247">Mr. Shapiro, let me ask this one other question, it has been on my mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.653" offset="13014518">Is it your understanding that the matter of establishing the contemporary community standard is part of the government's affirmative case or is it part of the defense that the defendant may assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="3265.832" offset="13063314">Which -- who has the burden on that issue?</text>

            <label>Mr. Howard E. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="3267.904" offset="13071569">Well, of course the -- since it is a criminal case -- there's always a burden of persuasion on the government to establish beyond the reasonable doubt that the material involved defense community standards within the Miller test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.861" offset="13147429">On the other hand, the Court's decisions made it clear there is no burden on the government of coming forward with evidence on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.137" offset="13180447">Now, I think the case can be summed up by trying to decide whether something that is offensive necessarily has to be illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.752" offset="13270936">The constitutional test in Miller does not equate offensiveness to the community with illegality in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.762" offset="13310955">And that's really the essence of our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.535" offset="13322136">This concept of community mores that the statute involves, that the Miller test involves simply reflects a practical and realistic way of handling what the court has described as an impractical problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.381" offset="13409489">There are all kinds of things that are offensive in our society, lying may be offensive, using vulgar language is offensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.336" offset="13453270">These things offend community mores, they aren't illegal necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.508" offset="13469989">The distribution of obscenity in Iowa to adults is not a crime but it still may offend community morals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.342" offset="13501336">The jury in this case concluded under the instructions based on the Miller test that the contemporary community standards were being offended within the Miller meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.698" offset="13550759">The Court of Appeals affirmed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.897" offset="13563507">We think that's all that the constitution requires in a federal prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.183" offset="13584718">The defendant had the advantage of consideration by the jury of the effect of the federal -- of the Iowa decriminalization of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.759" offset="13626932">The jury concluded as well it might that that did not mean that this material did not offend community standards, and so the defendant was convicted and so that conviction should be affirmed.</text>
