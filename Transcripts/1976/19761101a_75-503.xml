            <text syncTime="47.696" offset="291214">My name is George Cochran, I represent the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.579" offset="306783">I have with me, Mr. John b. Freese(ph) an attorney from Ashland Mississippi who handled the case to the Northern District from Mississippi in the First Circuit Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.836" offset="343772">Primarily, due to Mr. Freese's efforts in this case, you know, I have the record as it is presented in the court, which I will spend a great deal of time on this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.017" offset="388494">This case of course arises out of Calhoun County Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.964" offset="404376">It would occur in Calhoun County as a Public School Board there made the decision not to re-hire the petitioners in this case for the sole reason that they sent their children to a private segregated academy, also located in Calhoun County.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.155" offset="481072">There is nothing in the record that indicates that the petitioners were nothing other than competent and respected by the students, fellow faculty members and the administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.160" offset="529137">Specifically the only reason they were terminated was due to their decision to exercise what this court is deemed to be a fundamental right in Runyon to send their children to a private segregated academy.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.084" offset="580755">Now, there are significant problems with the case as it now comes before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.135" offset="601026">One problem, I think is a policy as stipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.033" offset="616595">To understand what happened in Calhoun County, I think one has to understand the policy under which the school board was operating.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.693" offset="647211">On page 9 of the record, there is a stipulation made by Mr. Freese(ph) in cooperation with counsel for the opposing for the school board.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.405" offset="690051">That this policy as applied was limited to teachers teaching in Calhoun County and living within the County and if they met these two pre-requisites and they had to send their children to the public schools of that County.</text>

            <text syncTime="171.379" offset="785973">The policy as I brought to the court’s attention in my brief on the merits is altered from what I had in the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.640" offset="815021">I have cited the Court to page 298 of the record, which is the answer, filed by the respondents in the case as it begins.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.061" offset="844696">The answers filed by respondents indicate this policy has two problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.332" offset="861833">The first is if you are living in the County, then, and teaching in the public schools, then you must send your children to the public schools of Calhoun County.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.423" offset="894120">If you are living outside the County, then you must send your children to “public schools” not necessary the schools in Calhoun County.</text>

            <text syncTime="211.799" offset="947619">In Calhoun County, there would be that problem, yes, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.542" offset="966636">On page 32 of the record, counsel for respondent refers to the policy as stipulated and alters it somewhat.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.340" offset="1001849">This time, the policy is described to me that if you teach in the public schools of Calhoun County then you have to send your children to “public schools.”</text>
            <text syncTime="236.479" offset="1046362">So, we have a difference in the record as to what teachers had to do to comply, that is why they send the children to public schools of Calhoun County or to the public schools anywhere in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.335" offset="1093800">This is kind of firmed up on page 134 and 135, the final records in the record to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.775" offset="1115534">Mr. Freese is examining an expert witness and he refers to the policy as applying to teachers having to send their children to the public schools in the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.787" offset="1151583">There is an objection made by opposing counsel and the question is rephrased in the context of sending children to public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.295" offset="1185647">I choose to say that the policy has two separate facets to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.835" offset="1203828">One; sending your children to public schools at Calhoun County, and two, sending your children to “public schools” and this dovetails have been quite nicely with what you have in the record with respect to teachers who were threatened not to be re-hired because they sent their children to schools that might not have been public.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.687" offset="1299227">No, the Court of Appeals adopted Judge Katie’s finding with respect to policy and that was in essence that if you taught at the public schools of Calhoun County, you have to send your children to the public schools of that county.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.759" offset="1351472">But it does not match with the record because we have the innex (ph) who were black teachers in Hamlin, a white teacher sending their children to school outside of Calhoun County and checks are made as to whether or not these schools are public or private.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.883" offset="1404030">The indication is, there would have not been re-hired.</text>

            <text syncTime="380.584" offset="1622832">No, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, what I am pointing to with this fact is that, in order to understand the purpose and the thrust behind what the public school board in Calhoun County was doing, I think these facts are critical because we have a very articulately drawn policy and you have to focus in on the thing to understand exactly what is going on the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.780" offset="1699632">That is the only point I am trying to make and the other point is that if you do not construe the policy differently, then the court of Appeals and the United States District Court then you can not deal with these other teachers whose re-employment was threatened because they sent their children to, let us say schools in Atlanta or Jackson Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.706" offset="1779253">That is the only point I am trying to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.321" offset="1789702">I really do not think it is critical except there is a problem with the record on the basis of exactly, how this is policy operated.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.320" offset="1829722">I believe that if you look at the record, you can ascertain that fairly that the policy has three purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.708" offset="1863263">The purpose has been dealt with by the courts below, of course, has been compliance with the segregation order entered by Judge Katie in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.750" offset="1903491">Taking positive and affirmative steps to implement a unitary school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.129" offset="1925016">I will talk about that purpose later on.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.015" offset="1936510">I think there are also two other purposes that are clear from the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.798" offset="1951661">One is, ensuring dedication by public school teachers to the public schools and this is clearly all the expert testimony in this case indicates that one of the primary thrust to the policy was to ensure the loyalty on the part of the teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.153" offset="2025118">The theory being, if you do not send your children to the public schools and you will not be loyal to the schools in what you are teaching.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.104" offset="2052912">The record also bares out that this aspect of the policy, that is ensuring dedication was carried out in fact, by the persons responsible for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.400" offset="2098051">Mr. Hudson, the school principal.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.932" offset="2108187">There are two parts of the record in which indicate or highlight instances of how the policy was implemented.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.440" offset="2138280">You have the innex (ph) who are black teachers teaching in the Calhoun City School System.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.193" offset="2165238">They sent their children to a school in Atlanta and they were threatened with termination until it was found that these were indeed public schools.</text>

            <text syncTime="899.389" offset="3697999">The Department of Justice takes the same position on Page 402 and 403 of the record, you have a letter from David Norman of the Department of Justice when he comments on this policy and he indicates that the Department of Justice position is that this is part of the duty under a court desegregation decree to take positive and affirmative steps.</text>

            <text syncTime="1017.041" offset="4168621">That opinion says he starts off his opinion talking about his court order in 1968 to integrate the schools positive and affirmative steps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.375" offset="4205924">The latter parts of his opinion, he is approving this and making it part of the court order.</text>

            <text syncTime="1082.009" offset="4428487">This school board in Calhoun County, one part of the thrust of the policy was to ensure dedication and loyalty on the part of the teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.981" offset="4464432">This is completely divorced from compliance with court decree to implement a Unitary Schools System.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.055" offset="4496719">Another factor, which is clear in the record that motivated this decision, is the private segregated academy itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.821" offset="4527753">You get testimony on the records such as that from John Bert, a superintendent, where he is speaking to the policy and speaking in terms of we do not need a private segregated school in Calhoun County.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.871" offset="4579998">In another portion of the record, you have Malry(ph) who is a School Board President, on 218, he is questioned on direct examination as to what influenced him or the board in passing this policy and he puts in the record newspaper clippings, showing fundraising activities on the part of the academy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.921" offset="4668187">It is obvious that the part of the influence and part of the thrust behind what the School Board was doing was to curtail competition on the part of the private segregation academy, another aspect of the policy that has serious constitutional problems under Pierce v. Society Sisters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.333" offset="4733807">The last part of the policy which the lower court has spoken to is compliance with the court order to integrate the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.191" offset="4785216">In looking at this aspect, I think it is a correct thing to do to look at the history of what was going on in Calhoun County at the time, this policy was passed in order to ascertain whether or not, this policy was really needed in order to implement a Unitary School System under the court decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.217" offset="4865359">Now, Malry(ph) the School Board President testified that the policy had been under consideration for 2 or 3 years, which would mean in essence that the school boards are thinking about this policy immediately after it was put on the court order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.697" offset="4927217">That is in the context of the United States District Court Judge had not gone far enough in his order, and that they should take independent steps to -- beyond that which the United States District Court ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.977" offset="4976327">There are 2400 students in the Calhoun County system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.527" offset="4994613">At the time that the policy was passed, only eight teachers were involved sending their children to private segregated schools.</text>
