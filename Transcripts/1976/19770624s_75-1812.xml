            <text syncTime="8.232" offset="133446">Now, this case is here on appeal to the Supreme Court of Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.214" offset="153299">It is as, share holder's derivative suite which was filed by the respondent, Heitner, who was the owner of one share of stock in Greyhound Corporation against officers and directors of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.399" offset="210037">Greyhound is incorporated in Delaware but its principle place of business is in Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.906" offset="232085">There is no indication that the defendant directors had ever had any contacts with Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.801" offset="259670">In order to establish jurisdiction over these directors, Heitner utilized a Delaware procedure that allows a plaintiff to secure a quasi in rem jurisdiction over a non-resident by attaching the defendant's property located in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.771" offset="347546">For the purposes of that statute, stock in a Delaware Corporation is considered to be located in Delaware.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.496" offset="378475">The directors challenged the constitutionality of the statute on the ground that as applied, it allowed the state courts to exercise jurisdiction over defendants who did not have sufficient contacts with the State to satisfy the requirements of do process.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.288" offset="449632">The Delaware Courts rejected this challenge, holding that the presence of the defendant's properly in the State was a constitutionally adequate basis of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.559" offset="490697">We noted probable jurisdiction of the appealed and an opinion filed with the clerk, we now reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.928" offset="520163">We conclude that the due process clause prohibits the exercise of state court jurisdiction in the absence of minimum contacts among the defendants, the State and the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.644" offset="575020">The distinction between actions and “personam” on the one hand, and access in rem -- in quasi in rem on the other no longer justifies the application of different constitutional test of state court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.497" offset="634475">We also conclude that the simple facts that defendants are fiduciaries of a corporation formally charted in Delaware and owned stock or other interested in that corporation do not supply contacts with Delaware, sufficient to make them subject to de suite in that State.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.406" offset="710125">Mr. Justice Powell has filed a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.892" offset="724023">Mr. Justice Stevens has filed an opinion concurrent in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.114" offset="744921">Mr. Brennan -- Mr. Justice Brennan has filed an opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part</text>
            <text syncTime="166.482" offset="766445">Mr. Justice Rehnquist took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</text>
