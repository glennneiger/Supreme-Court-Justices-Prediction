            <text syncTime="9.670" offset="139188">The petitioner in this case stole an automobile from a parking lot in East Cleveland, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.614" offset="166983">Nine days later, he was arrested while driving the car in Wickliffe, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.099" offset="192896">He was convicted there of joyriding that is of operating a motor vehicle without the owner's consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.598" offset="222885">After setting a 30-day sentence, petitioner also was convicted in East Cleveland on a more serious charge of theft of the same car.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.890" offset="268024">Although petitioner raised the double jeopardy issue to his second prosecution, his conviction was affirmed by the Ohio Court of Appeals and we granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.029" offset="320583">The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no person shall be a subject to the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.016" offset="368543">Under Ohio law as construed in this case, the crime of theft includes all of the elements of the lesser offense of joyriding.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.789" offset="411593">We affirmed today the rule that two offenses related in this manner are the same for the purposes of the double jeopardy guarantee.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.561" offset="450672">As petitioner was placed twice in jeopardy for his single offense, we reversed his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.856" offset="479929">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a concurring opinion in which Mr. Justice Marshall has joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.803" offset="499678">Mr. Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion in which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Rehnquist have joined.</text>
