            <label>Mr. Alan J. Levenson</label>
            <text syncTime="68.862" offset="375978">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.828" offset="379844">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.857" offset="395936">My name is Alan Levenson and I am from Portland Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.074" offset="408788">I am here today representing Bayside Enterprises. Inc.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.837" offset="427805">Bayside is a poultry industry located in Waldo County up in Belfast, near Belfast, Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.535" offset="458630">The contention of Bayside and this involves six feed drivers, the drive poultry trucks, which are these specialized trucks that deliver grain.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.807" offset="503769">These poultry drivers are exempt from the National Labor Relation Act as agricultural labors.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.202" offset="533340">The National Labor Relations Act and Agricultural Labors makes reference to -- because of an act of Congress in 1946 and the Appropriations Act it is referenced to 3F of the Fair Labor Standards Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.995" offset="608468">In my brief, I have set out 3F and all of this discussion today is on page three and all of this discussion today revolves around 3F.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.168" offset="657160">Now, this 3F has been discussed many times before this court, particularly in Farmers Agricultural Company and what it says is that to be exempt, you have to either fall into a primary classification or a secondary classification of farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.334" offset="737826">Now, in the poultry industry, it makes specific reference to the question of raising poultry.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.619" offset="763008">So, when I talk about the primary definition of agriculture here, I will be talking about raising poultry.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.244" offset="789444">The secondary definition talks about incidental tour conjunction with farming when performed by a farmer or on a farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.676" offset="823194">So, I will have to be talking about farmer or on a farm an incidental conjunction with farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.858" offset="843883">There is also a phrase preparation from market, which is in the 3F which also has some consideration and some courts have hints to exemption on that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.295" offset="897696">The outline of my argument is that Bayside itself being a vertically integrated poultry organization comes within the definition of primary agriculture because it is a producer and that the feed delivery drivers are within the secondary definition of agriculture because of their work being incidental to in conjunction with farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.695" offset="991319">I will also talk in terms of a possible alternative argument that the feed poultry drivers are on the farm within the meaning of that, those words.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.565" offset="1034786">To summarize the arguments, the choice here, the feed poultry drivers are either one, directly in farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.465" offset="1066342">Two, incidentally to connected with farming or three, not connected with farming at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.699" offset="1087240">I will be talking about the first two choices and I will leave the third choice to my opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.061" offset="1112736">Briefly, I will like to talk to you about the facts of the case and just a little bit of sketch about the poultry industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.471" offset="1142411">Bayside is a singular enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.177" offset="1153173">It produces and markets poultry up in Waldo County Maine.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.716" offset="1175325">Although, there are two Corporations, there is a central management that makes all the decisions of the poultry company from one what is called from the cradle to the grave to raising poultry.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.485" offset="1222450">The company is made up of several components.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.357" offset="1233944">There is, besides the main office, there is a breeding hatchery with the several farms connected to it, a commercial hatchery with eleven farms connected to it, there is a feed mill, there is the feed delivery operation which we are talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.371" offset="1294025">There is a 119 contract farms which I will go into the contract later.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.555" offset="1314714">Bayside itself owns seven farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.396" offset="1326104">There is a processing plant with trucks to pick up the poultry from the farms and deliver it to the processing plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.523" offset="1358600">Briefly, this is how it works out.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.377" offset="1369990">The company has a Geneticist who makes the decisions as to what type of poultry they should grow.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.100" offset="1404889">They have been very successful because they have reduced the time it takes to grow from a broiler from 16 weeks to about 9 weeks and they make such decisions as how to grow a chicken with white meat or how to speed up its maturity and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.288" offset="1473643">You see, it’s a very valuable, integrate part of the business of raising chickens.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.180" offset="1493183">Well, after they decide that, they may breed flocks to produce the eggs.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.930" offset="1512200">Then, they take the eggs and they hatch them till they are one day old.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.988" offset="1532471">Then, they take and they place these one day old broilers on these contract farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.517" offset="1558594">While they are doing that, they have a feed mill and they are making feed for the broilers which changes according to age.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.627" offset="1587015">They change it at least four times and if the flock is unhealthy, then they change it more times than that.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.868" offset="1611988">Then they have this feed delivery system which I will talk about later that delivers the feed from the feed mill to the processing plant, no, from the feed from the feed mill to the contract farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.176" offset="1665173">Then, while the poultry is on the farms and the poultry stays on the farm for about nine weeks when they take it off.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.276" offset="1697565">They have these feed crews that go on to the farm and they vaccinate, blood test, debeak and all the things that you do to keep up the health and well-being of the poultry.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.280" offset="1745630">After the flock leaves, the farm crews go and they clean the poultry farms of the contract farmers and while this is all going on, this is all being directed by a Broiler Department Manager who directs the Supervisors, the forest farm Supervisors that check the farmers and then there is a farm crew.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.552" offset="1826714">He decides what age to market the flock and what sizes of the birds are marketable and then he sends out the crew from the processing plant who catches, coops and loads the birds for transport to the processing plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.717" offset="1887319">The processing plant processes the birds and markets them to a dealer or a chain or some intermediate third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.915" offset="1920128">Now, all of this that Bayside is doing is typical of what's going on in the poultry industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.570" offset="1942803">It’s a typically integrated broiler producing marketing firm.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="464.265" stopTime="476.187">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="464.265" offset="1957536">When you say this typical of this particular industry, do you -- would you distinguish that from large commercial farming operations generally, as they have changed from the old traditional patterns?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_j_levenson" startTime="476.187" stopTime="966.975">
            <label>Mr. Alan J. Levenson</label>
            <text syncTime="476.187" offset="2005287">Well, I am going to be very cautious here about talking about any other industry than poultry.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.309" offset="2025767">I can talk about the poultry industry that this is all of the evidence and the marketing reports that are filed with this court talks about poultry and they say that 95% of the chickens that are eaten today are coming from a vertically integrated producer of one kind or another and that’s what I say, I cant talk about cattle or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.883" offset="2120017">Now, the other point I would like to make is that nearly all the broilers today are produced by integrated broiler firms and that this development has gradually arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.179" offset="2181248">Now, what used to happen in the past, there used to be individual processing plants and individual feed mills and then there was individual delivery systems and as the farm and the poultry industry gradually evolved, each of these firms developed so that gradually, it became a concentration so that each one of these took in all the attributes of one firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.373" offset="2290022">What I am saying is that basically, there are four elements; I mean big substantial components of -- this type of vertically integrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.321" offset="2321787">They are the feed mill, the processing plant, the hatcheries and the producers, the contract growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.289" offset="2361598">Gradually, they all came together under one management and basically, they are all interdependent on each other and the management is like a bundle of sticks and they are all held together and the thing that holds them together is the management that’s making all the decisions as to what's going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.920" offset="2432128">Well, as a result of this development, the fact that is important to me it seems that there really is no significant live broiler market today.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.137" offset="2473088">You can’t go and raise chickens and sell them to anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.197" offset="2481239">All of these farmers are connected to some type of broiler organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.613" offset="2506943">Now that becomes critical when I talk about the part of the processing plant to this whole operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.679" offset="2531185">They are all marketed as ready to cook broilers by an integrated company.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.332" offset="2549784">Now, the argument of Bayside is because of this type of operation, that it is Bayside and vertically integrated operators like Bayside, that are in effect the operators, the producers within the contemplation of the statutes, they are the farmers and basically that argument breaks down into four elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.102" offset="2628883">First of all, the company is the one that initiates the production process, it is the one that invests in both production and marketing of poultry, it is the one that controls all the marketing, production and poultrying and fourthly, it is the one that actively participates in the management of the flock and the poultry husbandry.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.521" offset="2714564">Now, this position is sustained by two major cases in the poultry industry and one is Tyson poultrying and the other is NLRB versus Strain.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.749" offset="2755524">Now, there are other cases that sustain my position, but the discussion, the rational is set out in those two cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.795" offset="2795648">Tyson was an egg producer and Strain was a chicken, poultry farmer like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.444" offset="2822293">The contrary argument is that it is the contract farmers that are raising the poultry and that they should be considered the farmer and that has a ring of simplicity in it because the chickens are on the contract farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.466" offset="2878404">When the Court in Strain took this under consideration, they framed the issue this way, does the fact that the integrator uses independent growers, destroy its claim to having raise the bird or is the integrator more akin to the purchaser of the bird.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.313" offset="2949771">The court then reviewed the same factual type of situation that I have described and said, “Even though the raising of the birds was shared with independent growers, Strain’s activity were more nearly that of one engaged in raising poultry than a purchaser or a jobber.”</text>
            <text syncTime="731.102" offset="3024899">When Tyson took up the same situation, it said, “We are here concerned with the single completely integrated farming operation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="738.365" offset="3053947">Tyson is the farmers and they are the ones who initiated the farming operations here in (Inaudible) without the appellees that is Tyson, the independent growers arguably would never have undertaken the initial and continuing cost of acquiring the birds and producing the eggs, the contract growers merely aid the appellees who are the farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.478" offset="3134404">So, the issue drawn is, is a company like Bayside, a middle man, is it somebody that is kind of buying the chickens from the farms, is it somebody that is a purchaser, a distributor or something like that and the argument has been made many times and the rational and Strain really talked about are Rosebush case, they said, no, it was not -- I mean the Rosebush case that they decided was more of a middle man because they were buying it, they were only buying things that were marketable or a purchaser or something like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.127" offset="3289049">Well, all of this gets down to the core of the question or what some people feel the core is, the risk of loss.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.478" offset="3322381">Who is taking the risk of this type of operation between the farmers on the farm and the vertically integrator that is supervising all of this?</text>
            <text syncTime="814.692" offset="3359266">Well, that involves the contract itself; the contract guarantees the farmer a specific rate per week depending upon the size of the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.188" offset="3405242">He then gives it an additional bonus depending on his production as compared to other Bayside contract farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.207" offset="3433350">Bear in mind that Bayside owns the flocks at all time and that the chickens are a perishable commodity.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.499" offset="3466473">The point that I would like to make, is that the payments to the grower have no relationship to the market price that Bayside eventually gets from it.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.887" offset="3508060">Whatever happens, the farmer gets a certain guarantee payment and then he does participate in a bonus depending on anybody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.387" offset="3550065">Now, this can work out several ways because bear in mind there are two markets involved, one is the feed market, the grain that you have to buy and the other is the large market, I mean the process market that you have to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.823" offset="3603772">So, it is quite conceivable that the man, who is the farmer can receive a profit from his operation and then that same chicken can go out, be processed and sent to market and the vertically integrator can lose money and the reason for that is because the cost of grain can be more expensive than the cost of selling the bird.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.577" offset="3686842">It seems to me that some what critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.844" offset="3695828">On the discussion of this at the trial level, we talked a lot about who has the risk of loss and I was trying to prove that we had all the risk of loss, but there is no question it seems to me that some of the risk of loss, are if a man has -- well, if a man is employing other people, he would invest some money, so he would make less money then he would otherwise, but there is a case on this that has been pointed out to me about ducks.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.870" offset="3807945">In the Tax Court, and it is called Maple Leaf Farms 64, 438, Tax Court What they say there is that the risk is really unequal, in other words, a man who is a farmer, in this type of situation with a contract can really gage the kind of loss he is going to -- if there is going to be a loss, he is kind of gage what kind of money he is going to get in advance.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.075" offset="3904807">While, the person who is the vertically integrator has to deal with markets that are unveiled that you never know what you going to get and that kind of is a critical factor in talking about who is really running the farm and who is not running the farm.</text>

            <text syncTime="974.736" offset="3999475">It is 64 Tax Court 438 and one of the citations that says on page 451, of that case, it says, obviously this was talking about duck grower.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.576" offset="4054750">Obviously the grower also pores some risk of loss from the growing process, example, nonpayment for condemned ducks and out of pocket cost the labor, but on balance, we believe that the petitioner, integrator assumed a risk of loss from the growing process of sufficient magnitude to satisfy this element of the farmer formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.270" offset="4133536">One need not bear all the risk of loss to be considered a farmer, and they said also there is another case of an integrated egg producer Garth (ph) and that is 56 Tax Court 610.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.893" offset="4188079">If you just turn to the appendix of the petition for certiorari, you will find the contract itself, what we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.346" offset="4237921">Now, under the pamphlet that the government was kind enough to provide us, entitled the Main Poultry Industry on page 13, they say that this type of contract is called a straight payment type contract rather than a share the profit type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.613" offset="4338963">If only the southern growers have a share the profit type and the main people have a straight payment type, I do not rely on that to say that the southern growers are not integrators, I am just saying that there is a slight difference between the two, it would still be applied the same way.</text>

            <text syncTime="1187.939" offset="4852216">Now, however talking about this contract that I have before you, I like to point out to you that the integrator provides the chicks, the feed, the medication, the fuel and the litter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.971" offset="4912403">Now, the significance of providing the chicks in this case, it seems to be very important because you can easily see it if you were providing -- you had an egg business because then the product would be the egg and you were producing, you were giving the farmer chicken and out you come with an egg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.893" offset="4976037">What you are getting here is you are getting the meat itself so, that the farmer, so, that the product really isn’t the chicken, it's the meat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.113" offset="5008951">Now, the significance of that is it is the equivalent of giving a corn farmer 40 acre of land and says go raise corn because the product will ultimately be corn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.324" offset="5045836">Here, you are giving them the chickens, they go raise meat and you will get ultimately, processed meat.</text>
            <text syncTime="1241.875" offset="5067988">What I am saying is, it is not just the ownership of the birds that’s important in this relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.826" offset="5087841">I think it is very important, the fact that the product is the meat itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.735" offset="5123472">Now, as part of this contract on A (26) of this, the grower under (1) agrees to follow the instructions of the Bayside Supervisor in the care and the maintenance of the flocks.</text>

            <text syncTime="1283.144" offset="5233082">In other words, when we talk about the growers’ obligation, that grower obligates himself by contract to follow the instruction of the Bayside Supervisor in the care and the management of the flocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.521" offset="5286581">On A (27), he also agrees to allow Bayside to remove the flocks from the farm at any time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.630" offset="5330989">That’s on number 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.012" offset="5348543">Back to A (26) on 4 that contract farmer agrees to have no poultry other than Bayside’s on the farm during the period of this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.934" offset="5388249">So, he is restricted, he cannot have anybody else’s poultry except Bayside’s and number four well, he guarantees to use only those materials supplied by Bayside for the purposes of feeding and maintaining birds under this contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.878" offset="5464004">So, my point is that this is another disability than when a grower enters into this contract with the integrator that he undertakes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.200" offset="5501307">Now, the point is that the grower himself, if you look at the growers’ position in this, he isn’t the type of typical independent producer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.860" offset="5543939">He does not own the feed, he does not purchase or own the chicks, he does not decide what type of birds he wants to grow or what type of feed he wants to feed them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.526" offset="5586571">He does not decide when to market the flock, he does not receive a market price when the flock is taken, he has no obligation to transport the feed to his farm, nor catch coupon deliver the mature birds at the processing plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.629" offset="5642995">He must follow direction of the Bayside Broiler department Manager, field supervisors and farm crews and he does not vaccinate, blood test, debeak and he bears only his secondary responsibility for the health of the flock and treatment if it is sick.</text>

            <text syncTime="1587.769" offset="6451537">I think in the contract it says something about the fact that they will be liable if anybody gets hurt in their own farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.271" offset="6481526">So, to that extent I think then there is no question about it, they have independence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.861" offset="6499916">The question is about do they have enough independence to be considered a producer or who is the producer, who is the middleman here, I mean that’s the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.718" offset="6547354">There is one other point that I would like to refer you to and that’s the Administrative Regulations that the Department of Labor puts out of the Wage and Hour Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.495" offset="6586434">In 780.125(B) there they take up the business about the words, ‘raising a poultry’ and it says, the raising of poultry includes the breeding, hatchery, propagating, feeding and general care of poultry all those things that Bayside is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.389" offset="6670025">Now, the other part of this argument that the First Circuit was particularly attracted to was the processing plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.917" offset="6700119">They seem to take the position that because so many people are in processing nearby, the whole things takes on a commercial coloration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.651" offset="6731047">Now, the answer to that argument it seems to me is in Maneja.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.464" offset="6758319">They make the distinction about processing, there is an agricultural processing and there is a manufacturing processing and they say that this distinction is if the product actually changes its composition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.337" offset="6837836">In Maneja at page 268 agricultural function, there is a manufacturing function saying there must be a change in the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.031" offset="6868661">Now, this very issue about poultry has been clarified in the case here East Texas Motor Freight Lines versus Frozen Food Express and that’s a 351 U.S. 49 and there they had a Frozen piece of poultry and then they said that a frozen and fresh dressed piece of poultry retains a continuing, substantial identity.</text>

            <text syncTime="3829.828" offset="15419792">Oh yeah, they are employees and the other point I wanted to make was that there is no considerations of fairness that require you to find these truck drivers, agricultural workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.926" offset="15488233">We certainly – our point is that, people that are performing similar work, the agriculture – the workers on Bayside’s own farms and any employees of the growers are clearly, they are doing the same kind of work, they are both are agricultural workers, they are both within the exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.966" offset="15556360">Bayside also has a – the truck driver that delivers the feed to the independent farms, he is not an agricultural worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3875.305" offset="15601709">He is doing the same kind of work as these truck drivers here are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3880.426" offset="15622189">So, fairness considerations, they should be treated the way people are working during some of their work.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan J. Levenson</label>
            <text syncTime="3895.302" offset="15681748">Thank you Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3896.323" offset="15685823">In my presentation in chief, I never got to the question about incidental to in conjunction with farming and I would like to do it right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3902.843" offset="15711841">In the regulations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, I would like to make reference to you for a future research, 780.1578 and that says, “In case of transportation to farm of materials of supplies, it seems clear, that transportation to the farm by the farmer of materials and supplies for using his farming operations such as seed, animal or poultry feed, farm machinery or equipment would be incidental to the farmer’s actual farming operation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3933.068" offset="15832736">Now, in Maneja which they have quoted, that is 349U.S.262, similarly the exemption clearly covers the transportation of farm implements, supplies and field workers too in from the fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="3947.595" offset="15890832">In Farmers Reservoir, which Mrs. Shapiro quote’s is saying that is not incidental to in conjunction with farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="3953.518" offset="15914551">I dispute that entirely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3955.247" offset="15921447">Turn at 337 U.S. 766, it is speaking about the delivery of water to the head gates of farms by irrigation company workers, “It is equally clear that it does constitute a practice performed as in incident to or in conjunction with farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="3970.516" offset="15982574">The irrigation company workers were not exempt however, because the delivery was not by a farmer or in a farm.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3976.790" offset="16007652">Abbott Farms, 487, 904 holds the production in high and incidental to in conjunction with poultry is farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.364" offset="16041924">Where it expresses our (Inaudible) of the farms 372, 584, 589, Footnote 4, movement of food and workers to the fields has significance in purpose only in making it possible for the harvesting activities to take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3999.045" offset="16096677">What I am saying, if you own an individual feedmill and you have got truck drivers permit, those truck drivers are incidental to in conjunction with the mill, makes sense, but if you own three million chickens all over the farms, you are trying to raise chickens, you are not trying to raise deliver feed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4016.147" offset="16165118">With regard to the, how the feedmill works, one-third of the production went to an independent feed company at the time they brought the thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="4027.900" offset="16212138">It does not go to it now, but the feed that goes to the farms, only if driven by Bayside drivers to Bayside farms, they connect it up at the feedmill, they pour it in the truck, they drive to it and they unload it at the farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.657" offset="16271070">These days, what is feeding the chicken?</text>
            <text syncTime="4045.448" offset="16282251">The guy who is deciding who is – what the feed that chicken is extremely important, because he is deciding how to change the feed every minute or the third.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.859" offset="16319972">One more thing, I have left out this business on our farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.403" offset="16334078">In modern day farming, you got at least four separate elements, you have got the hatcheries, you have got the poultry processing plant, you have got the feedmill and you have got the poultry growers.</text>
            <text syncTime="4068.936" offset="16376187">What is the farm?</text>
            <text syncTime="4069.961" offset="16380367">I contend the farm is everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4071.970" offset="16388412">Every element of that thing is on the farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="4074.698" offset="16399279">What is the driver doing?</text>
            <text syncTime="4075.779" offset="16403563">He is driving from the feedmill to the contract farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="4082.912" offset="16432089">That leaves open the question, what about the highways, driving back and forth in that highway, that is the weakness in the idea, that is addressed by the case of NLRB versus Olaa Sugar, 242 F.2, at Page 717, “It is common knowledge that even small farms are frequently bisected by public roads, even small farm operators frequently owner operated non-contiguous field reached only by public roads.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4111.921" offset="16548177">If such a farmer send his truck driver to Hull Hay, built in a distant field to be stacking of the farm building, the operation would not seize to be an agriculture one, even if the employee make some use of the public road in his trip.</text>
            <text syncTime="4123.457" offset="16594362">That this be true in the case of a full small farmer, the case should also be true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4127.885" offset="16612021">You have also got this case of Brannon versus Sugar growers, 486 F.2, 1011, those who were cooks, they were cooking in a labor camp and, “They held that they were on as farm as much as you could be on a farm, given the fact you were in the labor camp.”</text>
            <text syncTime="4142.957" offset="16672311">What I am saying is the primary purpose of this statute is if you are in agriculture, well now-a-days, that is agriculture and they just would not recognize this when they take and they combine all these elements into one that you are back to the original farm and doing everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.977" offset="16732393">Now, you have got the whole thing doing everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="4160.093" offset="16740856">Now, the question that Maneja raises and the reason that I am not saying that this is primary farming, is for some reason Maneja says, this transportation of a truck from a field is secondary farming.</text>
            <text syncTime="4171.537" offset="16786623">Olaa Sugar questions that you can not understand why that is not part of the harvesting operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="4176.892" offset="16808043">I say to you quite frankly and I have never understood why it is not part of raising poultry.</text>
            <text syncTime="4181.823" offset="16827792">It is not incidental to, it is direct poultry and that is the issue to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.970" offset="16848376">I was exempt either one or the other, but I never considered that I was not exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="4192.018" offset="16868543">My time has run out, thank you.</text>
