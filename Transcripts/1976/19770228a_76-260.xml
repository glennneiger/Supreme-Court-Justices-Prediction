            <text syncTime="86.400" offset="446108">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this is an appeal by the Attorney General of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.418" offset="490202">A Defendant below was also charged, of course, with the responsibility of defending the constitutionality of state statutes from a judgment of a three-judge court in the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.012" offset="560524">The judgment below declared Section 22 of the State’s election law unconstitutional and joined its enforcement against the Appellee as being violative of the Federal Constitution under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.378" offset="650072">In relevant part and in essence, the statute in dispute provides that the refusal of a political-party officer to waive immunity from criminal prosecution, when called before a grand jury to testify with respect to the conduct of his political office, thereupon affects a termination of tenure of the office and also invokes a disqualification, beginning then and there, from holding for a period of five years thereafter any party or public office; and parenthetically, I might note that the type of immunity which is mandated by the New York statutes, the New York Criminal Procedure Law, when a witness testifies under immunity before a grand jury, it's not simply use immunity, but full transactional immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.566" offset="938777">Now, the salient facts of the case are few and, I think, undisputed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Irving Galt</label>
            <text syncTime="288.768" offset="1255590">Now, of course, it’s relevant to let the Court know that at the time this action was begun under 42 U.S.C. §1983, the Appellee held, and the action arose out of his holding of, four party offices defined and recognized as such under New York law.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.568" offset="1358826">First of all, I was going to say he is; but very recently this changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.495" offset="1382441">He was State Chairman of the State Democratic Party in New York and a member of its Executive Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.424" offset="1426222">He was and is also Chairman of the Bronx County Democratic Executive Committee and a member of that Committee, also.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.912" offset="1468122">And it was only after the briefs were filed in this case, may I note, that Mr. Cunningham stepped down from one of these offices, that of State Chairman of the State Democratic Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.895" offset="1528100">But important in this connection it would be to note that party officers, and even high party officers like Mr. Cunningham, are not elected either by the elector at large or the Democratic electorate, but by a relative handful -- in fact, the real handful -- of other party officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.228" offset="1637396">Now, as State Chairman, and this is true of the State Committee itself, there are many formal functions which New York law attaches to those offices, connected, of course, principally with the electoral process.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.228" offset="1709389">But informally and aside from that, I need hardly remind this Court of the great power, the great influence, the tremendous prestige, which the Chairman of a state political party has.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.522" offset="1762575">And in this instance, the Democratic Party rules in the State of New York explicitly denominate the Chairman of the state party as the top leader of the Democratic Party in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.902" offset="1820149">And there are, I think at ages three to four of our briefs, we have outlined these functions; and the same with respect to his Chairmanship of the Bronx County Democratic Executive Committee, also a very powerful office and one which exerts considerable influence and one which will make its influence felt, I think, too, as a great county organization in the upcoming nominations for the mayoralty campaign, which will take place in 1977 in the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.764" offset="1967584">But in tandem, the holding of these two offices, these two party offices, represents a great deal of power on the part of the holder of the office, or of these offices, and I need hardly elaborate on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.769" offset="2031636">I do wish to point out to the Court that in none of these party offices was Mr. Cunningham salaried or is he salaried.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.687" offset="2071238">There is no monument of any kind, no consideration of any kind, which he received from any of his party offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.887" offset="2108018">And --</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="502.326" offset="2109794">If you prevailed, Mr. Galt, would a person in the position of Mr. Cunningham be barred from being a delegate to the national convention of his party in the five-year period?</text>

            <label>Mr. Irving Galt</label>
            <text syncTime="514.770" offset="2159636">That’s not holding party office; at least I'm quite sure it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.025" offset="2176563">As a matter of fact, if Your Honor is touching upon -- and you may be at this point touching upon the freedom-of-association argument, in that respect there would be no play for the argument, because he would be free to do anything he wishes other than being barred in the office itself or from party office.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.451" offset="2250333">He can counsel as much as he wants, advise, do anything he wishes with respect to his fellow Democrats.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.235" offset="2277500">The statute doesn’t bar him from that, and I'm sure he could be elected a delegate.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.720" offset="2303414">That’s not defined as a party office in New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="554.260" offset="2317520">I had no particular scope in mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.832" offset="2323789">I just wanted to know how far was the reach of the statute, but you think it would not bar him from being a delegate.</text>

            <text syncTime="562.497" offset="2350539">I'm quite sure it would not.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.266" offset="2357540">I would almost be positive in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.482" offset="2378438">Now, I do think it pertinent to mention before going on that at all times and all of these times, Mr. Cunningham was and is an attorney in active practice in the City of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.681" offset="2463283">Now, when in December 1975 a subpoena was first served upon Mr. Cunningham by the then Special Prosecutor in charge of investigating the criminal justice system in New York, that subpoena was resisted.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.993" offset="2548442">An action was brought immediately in the state courts to quash the subpoena on various grounds, including the Fifth Amendment, First Amendment, Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment grounds urged here, went all the way through the state courts to the highest appellate level in the state, and Mr. Cunningham was unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.146" offset="2625138">And so, as it happened, he finally appeared before the grand jury on April 12th of last year, at which time presented with a waiver of immunity to sign he refused to sign it and did not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.119" offset="2692952">And of course, the operation of that statute would be automatic, and he would have been barred immediately from his party offices and from holding the other offices I have mentioned for five years; but immediately brought this action in the Southern District of New York and on the very same afternoon, April 13th, before a single district judge, we argued the matter on the question of a TRO.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.557" offset="2794725">A TRO was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.028" offset="2800576">There were greatly expedited proceedings before the three-judge court, and in a matter of almost days the case had been argued and the decision rendered below.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.377" offset="2842059">And that decision, as I have indicated, was to strike down the statute, Section 22, as unconstitutional on Fifth Amendment grounds without the Court having reached, however, the First Amendment claim and, in so doing, the Court specifically said that Section 22 of the New York Election Law is similar in operation to the statute struck down in the aforementioned cases, being, of course -- and I'm intercalating this -- the Garrity againts New Jersey in 385 U.S. and continuing on through this Court’s 1973 decision in Lefkowitz againts Turley in 414 U.S. And going back to what they said, "The statute struck down in the aforementioned cases, in that it", meaning Section 22, "conditions tenure in office upon the forfeiture of the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.954" offset="3100358">As such, it would appear to fail to measure up to constitutionally accepted standards."</text>

            <text syncTime="897.737" offset="3691456">And that question, I submit, is a very vital one, not only to the State of New York and its citizens, but to this Court and be really to the nation at large, because we are in ...</text>

            <text syncTime="915.636" offset="3763032">But the very grave interests here at play, Mr. Justice Marshall, I think, cannot be overlooked, and in the course of argument, without any denigration of Mr. Cunningham’s rights, I will try to indicate, if possible, that the State of New York acted with perfect propriety here; and as we go on, I think, Your Honor -- and I hope I may have the benefit of your consideration in this regard -- we will show that the State of New York has a perfectly constitutional statute in Section 22, because as everyone knows, we have just been through an era, and we may not have emerged from it yet, in which the nation witnessed the spectacle -- and that’s not an exaggerated word, spectacle -- of very high party officers abandoning their office in the midst of scandal and corruption and scenes of scandal and corruption that I think have been on parallel.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.337" offset="4017882">And not only that, on parallel, too, has been the growth of public cynicism, public distrust, of politicians in a political office in political parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.519" offset="4070545">In fact, it’s an everyday thing, commonplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.981" offset="4084442">You can speak to any man in the street, and he will tell you that all politicians are not to be trusted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.728" offset="4119447">Now, New York was quick to respond to that situation, just as did the Federal Government in 1974, when it enacted the Federal Campaign Contributions Act, which this Court upheld in very large part in Buckley against Valeo in 324 U.S. last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.560" offset="4206800">So New York enacted a Campaign Finance Reform Law and Contributions Law with a new State Board of Election designed to see to it that the political process would be responsive to the needs and demands of the citizenry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.055" offset="4292691">It also enacted in 1974, the same year, a Public Information Law, and in 1976 it enacted an Open Meetings Law, which would extend to every public agency in the state, even down to and including the smallest buyer or special service district.</text>

The Legislature, which of course has representatives of political parties; its members are representatives of political parties, and the political parties knowingly enacted this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.895" offset="4492057">And while it predated these reform measurements, Section 22 has the same aim and endeavor, and that is to maintain the confidence of the people in the political process and in representative government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.816" offset="4567812">And I think that it’s fair to say that Section 22 is patently designed to avoid the spectacle of high officials and high party officers refusing to account for their activities in party office under oath, and doing that with impunity, because they feel that they need not waive immunity; and they can then, if they testify under immunity, no matter what they testify to, no matter how the acts may violate the criminal law and then, of course, they are forever immune from prosecution on the transaction unless testimony of an entirely different nature of a new situation should arise.</text>
