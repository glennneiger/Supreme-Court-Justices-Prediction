            <label>Mr. Richard N. Winders</label>
            <text syncTime="58.326" offset="333749">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.159" offset="345139">My name is Richard Winders.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.560" offset="350677">I am an Assistant Attorney General of the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.912" offset="364156">This case involves the kidnap and rape and murder of a 10-year-old girl in Des Moines, Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.023" offset="392577">The questions that will be presented, concern whether or not the respondent Williams was deprived of his constitutional rights when he was transported by police officers from Davenport, Iowa to Des Moines, Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.325" offset="445762">During that trip Williams made self incriminating statements and ultimately led the police to the body of the little girl.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.108" offset="480871">Williams was convicted of first-degree murder by a Jury Verdict in Polk County, Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.275" offset="501560">His conviction was affirmed by the Iowa Supreme Court in a five to four decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.046" offset="520681">Williams petitioned for a Writ of Habeas Corpus in the Federal District Court of Iowa, that petition was sustained by the Federal District Court Judge Hanson.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.726" offset="559343">We appealed to the Eighth Circuit and in two to one decision, Justice Webster dissenting; Judge Hanson’s opinion was affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.718" offset="591317">Our petition for rehearing en banc was denied although three Justices had voted to hear it.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.672" offset="619215">In 1968, on the day before Christmas, Pamela Powers accompanied her mother to the YMCA in Des Moines to watch her brother participate in a wrestling match.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.983" offset="660384">They arrived about noon.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.636" offset="671042">Pamela got some candy and then remembered that she should wash her hands and asked her mother, if she should go to the washroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.898" offset="700090">Her mother gave her that permission.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.931" offset="708241">Pamela left, she never returned and was never seen alive again.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.679" offset="727153">The respondent Williams was a resident of the YMCA and about 1:00 or 1:30, he was seen hurrying through the lobby of the Y carrying a large bundle wrapped in a blanket.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.521" offset="774592">He got outside and asked a young boy if the boy would open the car door for him.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.728" offset="791415">The boy did, Williams threw the bundle inside and the boy testified at trial there were two skinny white legs in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.173" offset="821194">YMCA personnel tried to stop Williams, but he pushed them aside and locked doors at the car and drove away.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.988" offset="856407">Two days later on the morning of the 26th of December, Henry McKnight, a lawyer in Des Moines came to the Des Moines police station and advised officers there that Mr. Williams had phoned him from Moline, Illinois and Mr. McKnight said that he advised Williams to surrender in Davenport, Iowa which is just across the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.785" offset="947627">Williams did surrender in Davenport at approximately 9 o’clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.569" offset="958703">He was arrested and given his Miranda warnings by a Lieutenant Ackerman.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.094" offset="980855">He telephoned McKnight who was in Des Moines police station and McKnight’s end of the conversation with Williams was overheard by chief of police Nichols and also Officer Claudius Leaming.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.231" offset="1033413">McKnight told Williams among other things that Des Moines police officers would come and pick him up, that they would not grill him, they would be nice to him and they let no harm to him and they would talk it over in Des Moines.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.380" offset="1082001">They further told Williams that you have to tell the police where the body is, you are going to have to tell them.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.575" offset="1106765">He ended this conversation by saying, well, it makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.305" offset="1121707">You come back to Des Moines, tell me, I will tell them, I am going to tell them the whole story.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.547" offset="1146680">Judge Zinato (ph) of the Polk County District Court in a suppression hearing found that from that conversation that there was an agreement existing between the police and Mr. McKnight that no questions would be asked of Williams on his way back to Des Moines.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.697" offset="1203313">He found this even know both chief of police Nichols and officer Leaming denied the existence of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.966" offset="1236332">Leaming and Officer Nelson went to Davenport to pick up Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.876" offset="1259947">They arrived around noon.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.438" offset="1266216">In the meantime, Williams had been taken before a Municipal Court Judge arraigned in a fugitive warrant and for the second time given the Miranda warnings by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.462" offset="1302370">He was also granted a private conversation with the judge in chambers.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.380" offset="1322014">As he was leaving, he noticed individual in the courtroom and asked if the man was a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.282" offset="1337583">It was a Thomas Kelly from Davenport and Williams was allowed to talk to him in private for about 40 minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.157" offset="1369139">Leaming first saw Williams at approximately 1 o’clock on that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.262" offset="1389514">He for the third and last time gave Williams the Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.758" offset="1407486">He also stated to Williams, now I want you to understand that you are represented by Mr. Kelly here in Davenport and by Mr. McKnight in Des Moines.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.926" offset="1444162">Williams acknowledged that he understood that.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.710" offset="1455343">Leaming further stated that I want you to remember what I have told you here because we will be visiting on the way back to Des Moines.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.946" offset="1480211">They left about 2 o’clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.573" offset="1494735">Leaming testified both at the suppression hearing and trial that shortly after they left, Williams started asking him questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.444" offset="1522216">He asked about the police procedures whether they had searched for fingerprints in his room, whether they had searched friends of his.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.221" offset="1549384">They also had further discussion pertaining to religion, church groups singing in that type of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.621" offset="1570908">Leaming testified further that he made a statement to Williams shortly after they got on a freeway outside of Des Moines.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.862" offset="1603927">He stated to him, I want you to observe the weather conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.441" offset="1618242">It is raining and freezing, it is going to snow tonight.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.704" offset="1631304">You yourself are the only person that knows where this little girl’s body is, and you have only been there once.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.569" offset="1658784">I think we will be going right by the area where the body is.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.796" offset="1671637">I feel that we should stop and locate the body on the way to Des Moines rather then waiting and coming back because you may not be able to find it.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.658" offset="1703088">The parents of this little girl deserve a Christian burial for the girl that was snatched away from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.221" offset="1725344">Williams asked him why he felt they would be going by the area and Leaming replied to him, I know it is in Mitchellville area, I do not know where, but I know it is there.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.611" offset="1766931">Leaming ended this conversation by telling Williams, I do not want you to answer me.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.508" offset="1790546">I do not want to discuss it any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.679" offset="1799219">Just think about it as riding down the railroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.983" offset="1812384">Williams further stated to Leaming and according to Leaming that also for the first time, shortly after leaving Davenport on the freeway that Williams told him when I get to Des Moines and see Mr. McKnight, I am going to tell you the whole story.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.480" offset="1878422">They proceeded on interstate and shortly before they got to Grinnell ascent, William spontaneously volunteered a question to Leaming, where did you find the little girl’s shoes.</text>

            <text syncTime="490.186" offset="2061175">Williams or Leaming stated that he had a theory if the body was in the Mitchellville area and Williams at the suppression hearing also stated that, so he had been told by Leaming that they speculated the body was in the Mitchellville area.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.788" offset="2119584">So it was not exactly a lie.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard C. Turner</label>
            <text syncTime="608.810" offset="2535767">When I found out we had only a half hour to argue this, I felt like the poor guy that sat down in one night near income tax time to do his income tax return and reading the instructions that it will only take the average tax payer a half hour and he said to himself oh! My Gosh it will take me longer then that to find my wife’s social security number.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.866" offset="2643914">But the facts in this case are very important of course and I think perhaps we should examine them further and Mr. Winder said that it was shortly out of Des Moines that he made this Christian Burial statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.133" offset="2717057">It was actually, I think he must have spoken very shortly after leaving Davenport or entering on to the highway.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.364" offset="2745896">Now, the highway was IS, even the defendant testified to this, it was sleeting, it was cold, and the predictions for that night were for snow and he did tell this man to induce him and knowing I think that he was a religious man, and even he even called him, in the suppression hearing, he said he called him reverend.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.953" offset="2848296">He did, he wanted to induce the man to tell him where Pamela Powers’ body was and in fact he did not really know that was in Mitchellville area and he did not for that matter really know that she was dead for a fact.</text>

            <text syncTime="722.725" offset="2991343">Now, as they rode down the highway, it was nearly about 20 miles from Davenport to Grinnell.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.961" offset="3028332">I can exactly show on these maps.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.258" offset="3037527">It is on the Interstate 80, right through Iowa and the Grinnell was a turnoff a few miles and when they reached that intersection at that point, Mr. Williams voluntarily and spontaneously volunteered that did you find her shoes and they said, well, they said, I, he knew, the Officer knew that they had found the little girl’s clothing, but he did not know, or he had not seen, he did not know what it consisted off and he said that if the shoes were with the clothing where we found it.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.047" offset="3192695">Well, he said pull in here and he indicated, then they went into a gas station and they looked behind the gasoline station into a box where he said he had disposed of a pair of brown boots and they did not find them.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.519" offset="3246507">They were never found.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.782" offset="3251627">They drove on then, continued on the highway after having a cup of coffee there, I think, they drove on and a few miles further they came to rest stop and he said, did you find the blanket, and he said well, it was with the clothes we found it and he said well pull off here, I disposed the blanket in the different place than I put the cloths.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.408" offset="3346086">So they have drove in there and they looked for the blanket, that the blanket had been found.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.574" offset="3366775">Then they drove on, the cloths have been found, they drove on and as they got the Mitchellville which is one of the very first exits outside of Des Moines and I think this led to Officer Leaming’s theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.567" offset="3426752">He theorized that I think that and inferred he would, the murderer would want to dispose the body as quickly as possible, and that he would turn off as soon as he could.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.603" offset="3486938">It was not a very first place he could have turned off, that was really in Des Moines, but this is a very first place outside of Des Moines.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.971" offset="3516404">As they approached this place, he said turn off here, I will show you where the body is and they did turn off and he took them up wrong road at first, he was a mile off on that, but after a couple of tries they went and located the body right where he said it would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.196" offset="3589233">And he asked the officer about the little girl’s face and some things like that that are in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.183" offset="3613161">The girl’s body was clad only in a T-shirt, otherwise she was naked.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.170" offset="3629148">She had been sexually ravaged, semen was found in her vagina, rectum and mouth and she died of strangulation according to the reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.377" offset="3677945">Now, of course when they got back to Des Moines, and then Mr. McKnight was quite angry, the lawyer was waiting there.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.895" offset="3720055">Indeed while it was found by the trial court in the suppression hearing by Judge Denaro who tried this case as the judge that there was an agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="1967.566" offset="7970699">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.970" offset="7984388">As the briefs in this case indicate, there are a number of constitutional problems that are raised by the record, and I would like to focus on what is the central and most serious problem, I think the one that Court has been dealing with so far primarily, and that is the deliberate and repeated efforts by the Des Moines police officers to deprive the defendant of the assistance of this counsel during an interrogation about the crime, the very crime with which had been charged, formally charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.576" offset="8126807">Now, this interrogation took place as Mr. Turner and Mr. Winders have indicated on the automobile trip from Davenport to Des Moines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.132" offset="8165050">I think perhaps I ought to come back and emphasize certain facts that existed and that everyone knew before the automobile trip begin and before the interrogation took place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.658" offset="8219072">First, the police fairly knew that the defendant had retained an attorney, Mr. McKnight to represent him with regard to the charges he was facing and indeed that Mr. McKnight had himself arranged to have the defendant surrender in Davenport.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.923" offset="8284169">Secondly, the police had been informed through counsel that the defendant did not wish to be questioned or to provide any information during the return trip to Des Moines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.964" offset="8332339">Third…</text>

            <text syncTime="2062.688" offset="8351251">No, Your Honor though I can conceive of circumstances in which the defendant could clearly state that he had changed his mind about that, where that he was rejecting his Attorney’s advice about that, but there is nothing even remotely resembling that in this.</text>

            <text syncTime="2084.011" offset="8436515">That is correct Your Honor and I guess that brings me to the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.183" offset="8457204">The agreement that the state trial court and Judge Hanson both found existed between the defense counsel, Mr. McKnight and the police to the effect that the defendant would not be questioned during this return trip to Des Moines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.476" offset="8514360">Now, there is clearly a considerable amount of support in the record for the trial courts findings, particularly on pages 3 (a) and 39 of the appendix, the testimony of Chief Nichols, effectually concedes that there was an agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.510" offset="8586562">At one point, on page 39, Mr. McKnight says, now did not you say when we found out and they had stopped to find the body that you hoped that they had not questioned him and had not stopped to find the body because we agreed that would not be done, and chief Nichol says, I may have said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.969" offset="8668378">And detective Leaming denies the agreement, but there Your Honor the trial court specifically expressed doubts about detective Leaming’s candor with regard to the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.117" offset="8712995">I think it is important here to remember that the state trial court got to see the demeanor, both of the witnesses and Mr. McKnight was in a peculiar position.</text>

            <text syncTime="2168.420" offset="8774121">The Supreme Court syllabus paragraph 10 refers to it as an alleged agreement and I suppose that there was no occasion for the state to challenge of the finding in the Supreme Court of Iowa, since the District Judge ultimately sustained a guilty verdict, but you do not contend, do you that the Supreme Court of Iowa upheld the finding that there was an agreement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3107.686" offset="12531261">I think the Court of Appeals might primarily on the Sixth Amendment and Miranda, Browns and I gather, they simply decided that it was not really necessary to also make the alternative finding of voluntary.</text>

            <text syncTime="3197.170" offset="12889139">Everything I have said, I think about the facts also relates to the Miranda claim, but clearly there is the violation here quite apart from Miranda or Escobedo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.186" offset="12933233">Now, under Miranda, again, there is alternative ground and I think, in fact, there are two ways of looking under Miranda probably the most important way here is that since the defendant himself and through counsel indicated rather clearly that he did not wish to make any statements in the absence of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.320" offset="13021736">Miranda says, interrogation must cease, per se rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.847" offset="13043888">I think this Court’s opinions in Michigan versus Mosley clarified that and reaffirmed that distinction between invocations of a desire to have a lawyer and invocations of the right to remain silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.587" offset="13098850">So that there is no question here about some time passing after that and being able to re-interrogate after a certain point of time, even under the right to remain silent rubric as I read (Inaudible) Your Honor, there was a clear length of time during which the right to remain silent had been invoked, it was about the same crime and that the Mosley analysis on that point also would not apply to this case, but the counsel point is still much clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.721" offset="13243359">Your Honor, I think I also want to make some statements about waiver here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.905" offset="13260077">I think the state’s primary defense really here is that somehow there was a waiver and what Mr. Turner has a relied upon here, first of all is the question, did you find the shoes and secondly the fact that the defendant provided information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3306.783" offset="13327578">Your Honor neither of those statements in anyway can be said to be an indication that I want to waive my lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3314.012" offset="13356521">There is not even an inference to be drawn there from the statement.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3318.010" offset="13372508">Well, here is another question, the question of waiving the right to remain the silent on this very crucial subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3327.664" offset="13411170">I think it is a different question from waiving a right to a lawyer, is it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="3331.298" offset="13425694">That is right, Your Honor, I think the second problem with the state’s view here is supposedly the statements come after the defendants’ right not to be questioned in the absence of his lawyer has already occurred, and surely Your Honor, the waiver has to precede the violation in order to take care of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3443.118" offset="13872910">Well, Your Honor, I think that the rationale in those cases was carefully limited to the purposes of the Fourth Amendment, the exclusionary ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.167" offset="13909168">This Court has recognized that there are rather different purposes behind that exclusionary rule and for example the protection of the right to counsel that is involved in this case for the Court to apply Stone and Rice in this case would be a tremendous expansion of the Stone and Rice doctrine well beyond the rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.182" offset="13989207">I think that the Court offered in that case, which basically related to the purely deterrent rationale of the Fourth Amendment, and I think we have that here, particularly with regard to the Sixth Amendment on the terms of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.869" offset="14071963">Your Honor, what the state basically asked this Court to do in this particular case, is to hold that law enforcement officers may do virtually anything, short a physical violence or threats, physical violence to obtain information from persons formally charged with crime during interrogation processes and reversal of the Court of Appeals and the District Court’s opinion in this case would mean among other things that the police would be completely free to ignore the existence of counsel in a criminal case and indeed to go further than that and to evade counsel through what the state itself has termed trickery and deceit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.051" offset="14280629">Your Honor, that result would be contrary to the precedents of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.235" offset="14301423">It would emasculate the Fifth and Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments in this kind of situation and it would also make it virtually impossible for defense counsel to operate in a sensible way in dealing with clients and the police in criminal cases.</text>
