            <text syncTime="7.706" offset="131362">In one of these two cases, 76-99, I am authorized to announce the opinion and judgment of the Court in this case being Occidental Life Insurance Company against Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a case which is hereon writ of certiorari to United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.915" offset="224149">In 1972, Congress amended Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 so as to empower the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to bring suit in a Federal District Court against a private employer alleged to have violated the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.268" offset="293531">The only question presented by this case is what time limitation, if any, is imposed on the EEOC's power to bring such a lawsuit in a Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.962" offset="344313">The District Court in this case held that the federal statute requires that an enforcement action must be brought within 180 days after the filing of a charge with the EEOC.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.564" offset="394781">Alternatively, the Court held that the action was subject to the most appropriate state limitation statute and was therefore barred by the one-tear limitation provision of a section of the California Code of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.014" offset="456535">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed holding that the federal law does not impose a 180-day limitation upon the EEOC's authority to sue and that the action is not covered by any state statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.198" offset="517243">We granted certiorari to considering important and reoccurring question regarding Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.521" offset="542530">For the reasons set out in some detail and the written opinion of the Court filed this morning with the clerk, we affirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.409" offset="582131">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion in which he is joined by the Chief Justice.</text>
