            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="9.150" offset="137101">This case comes to us on direct appeal from a three-judge Federal District Court for the Middle District of Alabama.</text>
            <text syncTime="18.138" offset="173046">The appellee, Dianne Rawlinson sought employment as a prison guard with the Alabama Board of Corrections and her application for employment and that job was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.217" offset="229366">She then brought this class suit alleging that she had been denied employment because of her sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.823" offset="279730">The Board of Corrections follows two employment policies that the District Court concluded do violate Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.587" offset="314839">By statute, Alabama requires that every prison guard must be at least 5’2” tall and weigh at least 120 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.140" offset="357052">The District Court found that the statutory criteria disproportionately exclude women from employment and that the State had failed to offer any evidence that the height and weight standards are job-related.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.113" offset="420896">Secondly, by an official regulation, the State has established a policy of not hiring any women as guards in so-called contact positions in all male maximum security penitentiaries, whatever the height or weight of the women guards might be.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.774" offset="499577">The District Court held that these regulations explicit discrimination on the basis of sex was not justified under the bona-fide-occupational-qualification exception contained in Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.551" offset="554643">In an opinion filed with the clerk today, we affirmed the District Court's invalidation of the height and weight requirements but reversed its invalidation of the official regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.991" offset="604484">The District Court properly relied on national height and weight statistics showing that 41% of the female population and less than 1% of the male population would be excluded from any prison guard employment under Alabama statutory height and weight standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.301" offset="677732">The State failed to rebut this prima facie case by demonstrating either deficiencies in the statistical data or that the height and weight standards are job-related.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.925" offset="728200">Secondly, we agree with the District Court that Titles VII bona-fide-occupational-qualification exception is an extremely narrow exception to the acts general prohibition of discrimination on the basis of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.039" offset="788595">On the facts of this case, however, we conclude that the explicit gender discrimination and the official regulation is within the statutory exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.267" offset="833526">Alabama's all male maximum security prisons are so violent and disorganized that sexual attacks on women guards are likely both to occur and to exacerbate the problem of maintaining institutional security.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.265" offset="901549">In these circumstances, we conclude that being male is a bona -- is a bona-fide-occupational-qualification for the job of guard in a contact position in Alabama's all male maximum security penitentiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.900" offset="968109">I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed an opinion joining only part of the Court's opinion and concurring in the judgment, an opinion in which the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Blackmun have joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.459" offset="1026310">Mr. Justice Marshall joined by Mr. Justice Brennan has filed an opinion dissenting in part and Mr. Justice White has also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
