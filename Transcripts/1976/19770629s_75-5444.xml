            <text syncTime="9.617" offset="139113">In Gregg against Georgia, this Court held that a death penalty was not cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment when imposed for the crime of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.635" offset="187179">The question on this case concerns the death penalty for rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.459" offset="206405">Ehrlich Anthony Coker escaped from a Georgia prison while serving long sentences for murder, rape and kidnapping.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.925" offset="240259">He then committed additional crimes, among them, rape and armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.410" offset="266277">He was convicted of both of those crimes and sentenced to death for rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.911" offset="284250">The death sentence was imposed in accordance with those procedures which the Court upheld in the Gregg case, and only after a finding by the jury that the rape is committed in -- with aggravating circumstances, namely that Coker had been previously convicted of a capital crime and that the rape was convicted while committing still another capital crime, namely armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.531" offset="390725">Coker's conviction was affirmed by the Georgia Supreme Court, that Court rejecting his claim that the death penalty was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.079" offset="432939">We reverse that judgment in so far as it imposes the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.106" offset="457076">Seven justices have concluded that the death penalty imposed in this case was cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.025" offset="496677">There is no single opinion for the Court supporting that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.745" offset="519561">I have filed an opinion which is joined by my Brothers, Stewart, Blackmun and Stevens, explaining while -- why we think that the death penalty is disproportionate and hence, unconstitutionally cruel and unusual punishment for rape under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.074" offset="600854">Justices Brennan and Marshall concurring the judgment since as they have said before they have concluded that capital punishment is cruel and unusual punishment under any circumstances for any crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.473" offset="654457">Mr. Justice Powell also concurs in the judgment on the grounds that the death penalty is cruel and unusual in the circumstances of this case, although it might not be in other instances of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.403" offset="702209">Mr. Chief Justice has filed a dissenting opinion which Mr. Justice Rehnquist has joined.</text>
