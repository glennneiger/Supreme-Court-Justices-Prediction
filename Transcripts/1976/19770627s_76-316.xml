            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100698">The judgment and opinion of the Court in 76-316, Bates and others against the State Bar of Arizona will be announced by Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="11.109" offset="145106">Well, this case comes to us from the Supreme Court of Arizona and it is the so-called lawyers advertising case.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.066" offset="184917">The appellants, Mr. Bates and Mr. O'Steen are licensed attorneys and members of the Integrated Arizona State Bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.976" offset="224518">wThey were charged in the complaint filed by the president of the State Bar with violating a disciplinary rule of the Supreme Court of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.362" offset="262135">That rule prohibited attorneys from advertising in newspapers or other media.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.625" offset="287108">The complaint was based upon a newspaper advertisement, the appellants had inserted for their so-called legal clinic.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.475" offset="322530">The ad stated that they were offering legal services at very reasonable rates and they listed their fees for certain services namely uncontested divorces and uncontested adoptions, simple personal bankruptcies and changes of name.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.338" offset="394001">As their defense to the charge, the appellants claim that the disciplinary rule violated the first two actions of the Sherman Act because of its tendency to limit competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.839" offset="444051">But they further claim that it also infringe upon their First Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.064" offset="468920">The Arizona Supreme Court rejected these claims and upheld the conclusion of the Bar Committee that the appellants had violated the disciplinary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.524" offset="510716">We hold first that the restraint upon attorney advertising imposed by the Arizona Supreme Court in fact was the exercise of the power of the State over the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.988" offset="568603">And as such, under a case entitled Parker against Brown decided here some years ago, the restraint is not subject to attack under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.914" offset="620326">To this extent, therefore, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona is affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.618" offset="643105">We then turned to the First Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.902" offset="656270">We note that commercial speech was held in the Virginia Pharmacy Board case of last term to be entitled to some First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.841" offset="695976">In as much as it serves individual and society's interest in assuring, informed and reliable decision making.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.269" offset="729727">We hold in this case that the justifications advanced by the Arizona State Bar are not adequate to support the suppression of all advertising by attorneys.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.918" offset="772358">We note that this case does not involve any question concerning personal solicitation by lawyers (Inaudible) chasing in the light nor does it involve advertising claims as to the quality of legal services.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.442" offset="834425">It concerns instead only the question whether lawyers may constitutionally advertise the prices at which certain routine services will be performed.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.916" offset="880296">Advertising legal services, in our view, is not inherently misleading.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.317" offset="905896">Routine services lend themselves to advertising and this is demonstrated by the legal services program of the Arizona State Bar itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.160" offset="945289">Advertising of course does not provide a complete foundation on which a person selects an attorney, but it would be peculiar to deny the consumer at least some relevant information needed for an informed decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.393" offset="1002236">It is entirely possible that advertising will serve to reduce and not advanced the cause of legal services to the consumer.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.389" offset="1034210">On the record of this case, the appellant's advertisement is not misleading and it falls within the scope, the First Amendment protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.035" offset="1068796">The term legal clinic is understood to refer to an operation like that of the appellant's that is geared to provide standardized and multiple services and the claim to provide services at very reasonable prices is not misleading for the advertised fee is in line with customary charges in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.581" offset="1155000">The dissent of course takes the position not -- this will effect profound changes in the practice of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.641" offset="1187183">Perhaps, this is so nearly all cases of constitutional adjudication.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.820" offset="1215918">So, the latter aspect of the judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona is thus reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.756" offset="1235666">In summary then, the state court's judgment is infer -- is affirmed on the antitrust issue and is reversed on the record on the First Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.915" offset="1276313">In that part of the opinion filed today which concerns the antitrust issue, all members of the Court joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.736" offset="1303585">The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Powell and Mr. Justice Rehnquist each have filed an opinion dissenting on the First Amendment issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.147" offset="1345276">Mr. Justice Stewart has joined Mr. Justice Powell in his opinion.</text>
