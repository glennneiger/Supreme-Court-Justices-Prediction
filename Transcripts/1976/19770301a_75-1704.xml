            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Urbanczyk</label>
            <text syncTime="68.551" offset="374709">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.317" offset="385785">This case is here on appeal by the Secretary of the Army from a judgment of the three-judge District Court in the Eastern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.199" offset="417237">The case generally concerns a provision of the Army and Air Force Vitalization and Retirement Equalization Act, a statute enacted in 1948 to establish retirement pay for non-regular military servicemen.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.053" offset="476691">The provision at issue here, 10 U.S.C. 1331(c), precludes Appellees and others from becoming eligible for benefits or retirement pay under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.364" offset="521935">The District Court held that that statutory eligibility bar as it applies to Appellees violates the Principle of Equal Protection that inheres in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, and the District Court has, in effect, enjoined the continued enforcement of that provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.229" offset="589436">The pertinent facts of this case are simple and straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.348" offset="601870">The Act was passed in 1948 after the war.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.036" offset="616603">In the Act, Congress for the first time established a modest form of retirement pay for members of the Armed Forces Reserve and the National Guard.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.067" offset="652757">I use the term "modest", because under the computation formula, the amount of retirement pay that an eligible reservist usually would receive is relatively modest and relatively small.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.701" offset="695284">In this case, for example, the record shows that if he were eligible, appellee Fioto would receive annually $1100.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.860" offset="727885">Now, to be eligible to receive retirement pay under this Act, the Statute provides generally that an individual must be at least 60 years old and have performed 20 years of eligible or qualifying service.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.758" offset="779503">But those general-eligibility criteria are expressly made subject to the exception in Section 1331(c), which is the statutory provision under consideration in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.086" offset="828822">Section 1331(c) pertains to all individuals who are in the Reserves prior to August 16th, 1945.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.958" offset="860273">That date marks the announcement by Japan that they would unconditionally surrender and the beginning of demobilization in World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.322" offset="889739">As originally enacted, the statute provided that individuals in the non-regular military service before that date were ineligible to receive retirement pay if they failed to perform active-duty service during either World War.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.650" offset="947104">In 1958, the statute was amended to permit such individuals to receive retirement pay or to become eligible to receive retirement pay if they had subsequently served on active duty in the Korean War.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.628" offset="1003006">Appellee Fioto’s case, I think, illustrates the application of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.566" offset="1022755">Mr. Fioto was in the National Guard from 1933 to 1940.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.746" offset="1043444">The record does not explain the reason why his enlistment was discontinued at that time; but in any event, his enlistment was discontinued, and he did not serve on active duty in World War II.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.901" offset="1088061">In 1947, shortly after the war, Mr. Fioto rejoined and re-enlisted in the National Guard, and he thereafter served for 20 years until his mandatory retirement age in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.041" offset="1140619">Fioto did not serve on active duty during the Korean War.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.691" offset="1155248">Now, the Retirement Pay Act, as I mentioned earlier, was enacted in 1948, less than a year after Mr. Fioto re-enlisted in the Reserves in 1947.</text>

            <text syncTime="316.045" offset="1364646">On August 27th, 1940, Congress passed and the President signed a bill authorizing him to call up a National Guard in this hemisphere for a year; and also on September 16th, the Selective Service Act was passed.</text>

            <text syncTime="381.963" offset="1628378">We have conceded that in this case, that is right, Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.057" offset="1652724">After his retirement, Fioto’s applications for retirement pay were denied predictably under Section 1331(c), and he then filed this lawsuit on behalf of himself and others similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.719" offset="1707372">Now, in the Complaint in the District Court, and indeed until the brief on the merits in this Court, Appellees have implicitly conceded that they were barred from eligibility by Section 1331(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="412.026" offset="1748541">Their sole contention instead was that that statute was unconstitutional, and that has been the focus of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.404" offset="1778112">Now, for the first time in their brief, they make the contention -- and it appears to be their principle contention now -- that the Section 1331(c) does not bar Appellees.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.614" offset="1822938">I can only take this to be an implicit acknowledgment of the weakness of their constitutional argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.507" offset="1842477">But before addressing that argument, I should make mention, then, of what we stated briefly in our brief, and that is that Section 13, there can be no doubt that Section 1331(c) bars individuals like Appellees from receiving retirement pay under this Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="495.142" offset="2081028">This class must be presumed to have known in 1948 -- that is when the statute was enacted -- that they would not be eligible or they could not become eligible to receive retirement pay, and this Appellee class nevertheless continued their enlistment.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.366" offset="2137975">As I was saying, the statute could not be written in any plainer terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.725" offset="2151349">The general-eligibility criteria of Section 1331 are made expressly subject to Subsection (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="519.735" offset="2179457">That provision says that no individual who was in the non-regular military service before August 16th, 1945, quote, “is eligible for retired pay under this chapter unless he performed active duty”, and then it goes on to specify the dates that correspond to the beginning and end of the World Wars and the Korean War.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.181" offset="2249152">There is only one reasonable construction of that statute, I think, and that is that persons described by it, including Appellees, are, “not eligible for retired pay under this chapter”.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.162" offset="2293142">Moreover, as we explained in our brief, Congress understood both at the time of the statute’s enactment and subsequently thereafter when it was reconsidering this statute, that that was the effect of Section 1331(c).</text>
