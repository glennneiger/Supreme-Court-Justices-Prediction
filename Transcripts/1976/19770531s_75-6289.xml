            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100618">The judgments and opinion of the Court to -- in 75-6289, Moore against City of East Cleveland will be announced by Mr. Justice Powell.</text>

            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="11.224" offset="145444">The appellant, Mrs. Inez Moore, lives in her home in East Cleveland Ohio with her son and two grandsons who are first cousins rather than brothers.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.111" offset="197062">A city passing ordinance, limits the occupancy of dwelling units to members of a single family.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.205" offset="229349">But underneath now, a definition of family, Mrs. Moore's household does not qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.234" offset="257457">As a result, the city ordered her to remove one grandson from her home.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.906" offset="280236">When she failed to comply, she was charged with a violation of the ordinance convicted and sentenced to five days in jail and a $25.00 fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.014" offset="320674">The city defends this restrictive definition of the family, excluding grandchildren when they are cousins on conventional zoning grounds, that is population congestion, traffic safety and the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.253" offset="381591">But we perceive no basis in light of these objectives for defining families so narrowly as to deprive grandchildren of their privilege of living with their parent and grandmother.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.738" offset="431537">The institution of family is deeply rooted in our country's history and tradition.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.920" offset="452226">That tradition is not limited to the nuclear family.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.036" offset="468736">Decisions of this Court long have recognized a constitutional liberty interest in certain family rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.713" offset="507397">The justices rejoined me in the plurality opinion find no justification for the severe limitation this ordinance imposes upon family associations.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.932" offset="556298">Accordingly, we reverse the Ohio Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.191" offset="573330">The plurality opinion I have filed is joined by Mr. Justice Brennan, Mr. Justice Marshall and Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.983" offset="608543">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a concurring opinion, joined by Mr. Justice Marshall.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.663" offset="631217">Mr. Justice Stevens had filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.370" offset="650025">The Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Stewart, and Mr. Justice White have each filed dissenting opinion, Mr. Justice Stewart's opinion being joined by Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
