            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="103424">We’ll hear arguments next in 1753, 1660, 1782, Santa Fe Industries against Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.140" offset="295894">Mr. Glendon, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. William R. Glendon</label>
            <text syncTime="51.196" offset="308120">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.763" offset="326405">My name is William R. Glendon.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.612" offset="333824">I represent the Santa Fe parties who were defendants below and are petitioners here.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.039" offset="371545">In this proceeding, there are raised some very troublesome and even startling problems by the decision below in reference to the scope of the Securities Laws particularly 10 (b) of the 1934 Act and further the entire relationship between Federal and State governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.584" offset="501739">The case arises out of fact that the plaintiffs are suing, claiming that in a short-form merger, pursuant of the Delaware statute, the price that they were given of a $153 was grossly undervalued and that this constitutes a violation of scheme and contrivance under Rule 10b-5 because it was given without notice, although the Delaware statute doesn’t require any notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.994" offset="635382">In fact, all the Delaware statutes were complied with and in this action under a statute requiring manipulation and deceit, it is clear that there was no deceit and there was no nondisclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.107" offset="699852">Nonetheless, two members of the Court of Appeals said that the conduct pursuant to the statute was a fiduciary breach and they said that this was a scheme to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.148" offset="764008">The dissenting opinion, Judge Moore said to say that, “the facts here presented a scenario of defraud -- of fraud was patent distortion of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.367" offset="808835">It was no fraud at all.”</text>
            <text syncTime="179.300" offset="820537">The facts very quickly are that Santa Fe acquired 60% of the Kirby Lumber Company in 1933 under a reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.721" offset="870275">In 1967, they acquired another 25% at a price, and I will remind Your Honors, the price claimed here to be undervalued, grossly undervalued as $160 -- as $125.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.663" offset="930043">In 1967, the remaining 25% to get them up to 90% was acquired at the price of $65.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.987" offset="959300">There were additional purchases of the stock in between 1967 and 1974 at prices of $65 to $92 to bring them up to the number of 90%.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.047" offset="1011545">Under the Delaware law, you may enter into a short-form merger if you have 90%.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.726" offset="1034324">Santa Fe decided to invoke the provisions of the Delaware short-form statute and have a short-form merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.358" offset="1076851">To do this, it did a number of things.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.447" offset="1089181">It first of all caused appraisals to be made of the physical properties of the Kirby Lumber Company and this physical appraisal of the property showed a value of the asset value of $320 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.197" offset="1156159">It also had an appraisal made of the mineral properties and this too was submitted to Morgan Stanley along with the asset appraisal whom Santa Fe had engaged to give it an independent advice as to the fair market value of the stock of the minority, the fractional shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.361" offset="1252812">The Morgan Stanley did an appraisal of the minority -- of this value, true market value of the stock and came up with a figure after considering a variety of factors including the appraisals which were submitted to them of $125.</text>

            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="302.307" offset="1312580">Why is that -- can’t the stock traded over-the-counter?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_r_glendon" startTime="306.166" stopTime="383.035">
            <label>Mr. William R. Glendon</label>
            <text syncTime="306.166" offset="1328044">The very thin market, Mr. Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.171" offset="1340061">I think that it was not even traded over-the-counter.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.111" offset="1351868">There just wasn’t much trading in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.873" offset="1358869">The record reflects the buys by Santa Fe during the period 1960, 1967 on, and as you will see, they have a very small numbers of shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.818" offset="1406621">Santa Fe took the Morgan Stanley recommendation of a $125, increased it to a $150. Parenthetically, this would be 12.5 times earnings for the previous year.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.094" offset="1475793">It set up a corporation called Forest Products, Inc. to implement the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.651" offset="1505991">It gave Forest Products $3.8 million to affect the -- have the money to buy in the minority stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.688" offset="1546115">And I mentioned this because the lower court took the misapprehension, was under the misapprehension that Kirby itself paid for the stock, that the stock was paid out of Kirby’s fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.182" offset="1600136">This simply wasn’t so.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.845" offset="1606719">The parent provided the money.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.242" offset="1624377">The merger, pursuant to the statute, was affected on --</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="383.035" offset="1635558">Mr. Glendon, is that really a significant point as did in Kirby incurring indebtedness to get the money from the parent?</text>

            <label>Mr. William R. Glendon</label>
            <text syncTime="389.485" offset="1661262">No.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="389.976" stopTime="391.733">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="389.976" offset="1663248">You mean the parent -- it was just capital contribution?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_r_glendon" startTime="391.733" stopTime="545.987">
            <label>Mr. William R. Glendon</label>
            <text syncTime="391.733" offset="1670353">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.753" offset="1678399">There was no -- and I stressed it because Your Honors will probably read the Marshel case along with this case which is another case that came out of the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.335" offset="1708701">And it was great -- stressed later in that case that a merger without a corporate purpose, where the company’s funds were used was a violation of 10 (b).</text>
            <text syncTime="411.707" offset="1750183">And I just want to make the distinction here that that didn’t happen here.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.607" offset="1777768">The merger occurred on July 1 -- on July 31 and on August 1 the next day, as provided by the statute, notice was sent to the fractional or minority shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.310" offset="1828655">Along with the notice and this is very important to our case, along with the notice went a ream of material, describing the background of the merger, describing the merger, describing the appraisals, concluding the appraisals, every single bit of relevant information that could possibly be put out was put out.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.562" offset="1905664">And there was, in fact, there’s no claim that any of that material was misleading, that it misrepresented anything, that it said that something was only a half-through, or that it failed to disclose anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.233" offset="1948296">There was simply no claim with reference to this material.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.101" offset="1971806">Indeed, the claim itself, the fact the claim of undervaluation is based on the figures disclosed by the information we gave them which, in this compassing strange in a 10b-5 nondisclosure case.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.328" offset="2032724">We moved to dismiss in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.322" offset="2048711">The District Court took a, it seemed to us and of course were prejudice, it seemed to us, took a realistic and rather straightforward view of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.584" offset="2089671">It said, there is no deception in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.316" offset="2096671">It’s a 10b-5 case.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.999" offset="2103359">There’s no claim of nondisclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.304" offset="2116629">Therefore, it is not a 10b-5 case and dismissed it to the claim that there was no corporate purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.524" offset="2137422">It said, “You don’t need a corporate purpose in Delaware.”</text>
            <text syncTime="512.109" offset="2151842">To the claim that there should have been prior notice, it said the statute provides proposed merger notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.482" offset="2173262">And I might just say there that that we think is the relevant time because that’s the time the minority stockholder needs the information in order to make an investment decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.649" offset="2214013">He wants to know at that time, “Do I accept the $150 or do I seek the appraisal rights which I have under the Delaware statute?”</text>
            <text syncTime="536.008" offset="2247450">So, we say and Judge Breen in the lower court said that this was proper and adequate notice under the statute.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_r_glendon" startTime="610.305" stopTime="730.009">
            <label>Mr. William R. Glendon</label>
            <text syncTime="610.305" offset="2544619">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.567" offset="2561651">I think as we suspended yesterday, I was referring to the Judge Moore’s dissent in saying that, to say that the circumstances here presented as scenario of fraud was a patent distortion of the term.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.107" offset="2639809">To put the facts into a little sharper focus, I would like to refer to a couple of matters the Judge Medina in the majority opinion in approaching the subject involved, made reference to schemes of loyal and cunning and so sophisticated as to almost defy belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.672" offset="2742105">In fact, as Judge Moore noted, this circumstances here were such that he found there were matters of utmost simplicity and patent reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.220" offset="2804276">In the concurring opinion, Judge Mansfield, invade against the idea of companies going public when the market is flourishing and then going private when the market is depressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.801" offset="2854536">In fact, as the records will show us here, Kirby has always been a public company.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.655" offset="2877942">The price that was paid for the stock was much -- offered for the stock was much higher than anything shown in the record before.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.225" offset="2920260">We don’t know what the plaintiff’s basis here for the stock was, but it is interesting to note.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.391" offset="2944920">I think it’s at page 102 of the joint appendix that he pleads as complaints of the fact that he is going to have to pay a capital gain’s tax on this transaction which is certainly a most unusual complaint of a victim of a claimed fraud.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="730.009" stopTime="734.939">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="730.009" offset="3023391">And of course, its claim is addressed to the fact that he didn’t have any option about disclosure.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_r_glendon" startTime="734.939" stopTime="1014.319">
            <label>Mr. William R. Glendon</label>
            <text syncTime="734.939" offset="3043140">Well, he does have -- he has another action, of course, of getting a fair valuation and the Delaware statute, as I pointed out Mr. Chief Justice, specifically provides in this part of his contract in the charter of the corporation that minority stockholders can be eliminated from the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.198" offset="3140211">I think the first principle that we should consider here is the fact that the Securities Acts, the 1933 and 1934 Acts, are disclosure statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.004" offset="3195382">This Court said in the Affiliated Ute case that the philosophy was to substitute a philosophy of full disclosure for that of a caveat emptor.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.551" offset="3237595">We think the court below ignored that as well as ignored their own holding in the Popkin case only two years before when they said the function of the statute is primarily to disclose and inform rather than becoming involved in passing judgments -- becoming a master in passing judgments on the information disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.968" offset="3323277">They ignored too, we feel the language of the statute itself which, as this Court said in the Ernst &amp; Ernst case, speaks so specifically of manipulation and deceit.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.569" offset="3369671">And we find no reference in the Court’s decision, the majority decision, to the language of the statute itself, and we think that, of course, we must begin there with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.931" offset="3419094">The language says, “Prohibits manipulative and deceptive devices in contrivance and contravention of the rules of the commission.”</text>
            <text syncTime="844.726" offset="3482311">And to us, it’s clear that that means, they are talking about deceit and deception.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.995" offset="3503313">The Court of Appeals met this problem not by tackling on headlong but simply eliminating deception and deceit from the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.560" offset="3549602">Even though, as I’ve said, I just previously stated a couple of years before that the disclosure was a key purpose of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.173" offset="3592025">The plaintiff tries to avoid this problem by a variety of references to other cases, other statutes relying, principally, it seems to us, upon arguments in cases which invoke matters of constructive fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.873" offset="3650853">But the statute is a disclosure statute; it did not, I repeat, did not try to take on all the wrongs of the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.458" offset="3681155">It said and the Congress adopted a philosophy of disclosure, and it says, when you disclose, you cannot make deceitful disclosures, deceptive disclosures, and that, we feel, is the problem before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.444" offset="3745102">The cases that this Court has considered on a matter, we think support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.801" offset="3770598">The plaintiffs seem to get support from the Bankers Life case but that was a clear case where this Court said that the statute should be read flexibly and we certainly agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.447" offset="3813125">But the Bankers Life case was a deception case.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.308" offset="3824619">It was a clear case of deception.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.838" offset="3830680">The Court referred there to the fact that misrepresentations have been made -- that the Board of Directors had been duped.</text>
            <text syncTime="937.749" offset="3854399">So, that case really offers no help, in our view, to the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.026" offset="3887522">The Court too has said that the statute will not be read narrowly and that artificial barriers -- and has removed the artificial barriers too to the administration of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1055.048" offset="4323558">He can either accept the offer or he can take his appraisal remedy under the Delaware statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.137" offset="4379878">I think, perhaps, the fallacy in the plaintiff’s approach and in the majority’s decision is simply that, they believe that every wrong or possible wrong or conceivable wrong that may arise in connection with securities, shouldn’t be cured by the application of 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.336" offset="4472665">I will discuss later what that may do to the federal courts but quite apart from the result, of such a thing, the fact simply is, we feel that the Congress never intended that and starting as we must to clear language of the statute, it just seems there is no basis for doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.585" offset="4545703">It is not and Judge Medina in his majority opinion recognizes 10b-5 is not a panacea for all wrong doings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.798" offset="4578513">It has a limited purpose which has and should be construed broadly, of course, but it has a limited purpose of requiring disclosure and having an informed investor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.252" offset="4628355">Now, the court below passing fraud, moved in to the area of fiduciary breach and it engrafted upon 10b-5 not fraud, but said that there was a fiduciary breach here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.410" offset="4697004">We do not think that fiduciary breach and fraud are the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.958" offset="4715186">There may be deception in a fiduciary breach but whether there is overreaching or conflict of interest or other aspects of fiduciary breach, they do not come under 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.130" offset="4763878">We think, it’s difficult to understand how the Court did that but then to engraft a fiduciary breach onto it, but it is almost impossible to explain what the breach was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.283" offset="4812466">And I would like to go into that just briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.404" offset="4825004">The Court said that the allegation of gross undervaluation alone was not enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.252" offset="4848410">That was not a fiduciary breach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.217" offset="4860217">But what it said was that undervaluation, combined with a lack of expressed corporate purpose other than the obvious advantages that may come to a company from going private.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.959" offset="4911208">But the Court said, the absence of another expressed corporate purpose and the absence of prior notice, although, as I think as I said yesterday that Delaware statute requires post-merger and not prior notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.541" offset="4957497">The Court said that the combination of those three things constituted a breach of fiduciary duty and that breach resulted in a violation of 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.491" offset="4997308">It was a scheme and contrivance and artifice to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.670" offset="5018102">Now, that we think is a startling proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.920" offset="5039104">It has the obvious vice of rewriting the Delaware statute because the Court had to rewrite the Delaware statute in order to come to that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.451" offset="5085184">The Delaware courts have said that the very purpose of 10b-5 is to permit the elimination of the splinter shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.666" offset="5130010">Commentators and I may say that some 30 other states have the same or somewhat provisions where minority shareholders can be eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.075" offset="5171702">So, to engraft on that, a requirement of corporate purpose nullifies, in effect, the Delaware statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.647" offset="5209945">Secondly, to engraft on or amend the statute, which now says, you must give notice 10 days after -- within 10 days after the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.417" offset="5252995">To say, you must give notice before the merger again rewrites the Delaware statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.404" offset="5280998">Judge Moore said something to the effect that the Court, while it was engrafting changes on corporate charters, was also putting the torch to Erie v. Tompkins and I think that’s a fair statement of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.671" offset="5346095">The Court simply rewrote the Delaware law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.763" offset="5358425">Now, in terms of corporate purpose, it seems to us that apart from the act of changing the statute, and not supplementing, not supplementing state law but supplanting state law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1686.988" offset="6851375">This case first arose because of the fact that the defendants made a motion to dismiss, so that all of the allegations and the fair inferences from the fact stated in the amended complaint are deemed to be true for purposes of this particular appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.118" offset="6915845">Now, Ernst &amp; Ernst stated that the 1933 Act was to protect investors against fraud and to promote ethical standards of honesty and fair dealing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.351" offset="6976763">And certainly, the same stricture applies to 1934 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.233" offset="7004348">Now, 1934 Act uses the term manipulative or deceptive device in contravention of the rules to be promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the SEC did promulgate 10b-5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.108" offset="7071848">10b-5, clearly, on its face, covers fraud, and this Court in Ernst &amp; Ernst when it was talking about 10 (b) and 10b-5 used the term deception, manipulation, or fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.821" offset="7126706">Now, deception and fraud are synonymous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.944" offset="7143111">When a person deceives, he may deceive by nondisclosure in a nonverbal way or he may be deceived by affirmative misrepresentations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.903" offset="7183026">Clearly, clauses one and three of 10b-5, as held by this Court in Superintendent of Insurance, stated that, “misappropriation is a garden-variety type of fraud.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.176" offset="7240077">The most important part about the deceit and fraud in Superintendent of Insurance was the fact the majority stockholder used the funds of the corporation to purchase the controlling interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.412" offset="7293053">But the defendants do not quarrel with the Schoenbaum case which has been decided in the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.666" offset="7314056">And what did Schoenbaum decided, it was an en banc decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1888.107" offset="7655842">Now, with a physical value of $320 million and a book value of $9 million, fair market value means that Kirby could go out, obtain a willing buyer and sell those timberlands for $320 million.</text>

            <text syncTime="1915.882" offset="7766915">Now, they retained the prestigious firm of Morgan Stanley and Company to come in and appraise the worth of the shares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1922.358" offset="7792828">They appraised it to a $125 per share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.572" offset="7801710">That was in June of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.337" offset="7808711">In July of 1974, they created a dummy corporation, Forest Products Inc. solely for the purpose and it stated in the information statement which went out after the merger took place, solely for the purpose of increasing their percentage of ownership from 95% to 100% of that corporation which meant eliminate the minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.703" offset="7894183">Now, then in end of July, the merger effectively took place between FPI Corporation and Kirby.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.796" offset="7938591">Now, there was no notice given to the stockholders and what was the effect and what were the terms of the merger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.974" offset="7967222">The terms of the merger were that Santa Fe decided that they were going to pay the minority stockholders unilaterally a $150 per share.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.083" offset="7999718">No stockholders’ meeting, nothing on July 30, 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.060" offset="8023646">There was no reason given on July 30, 1974 as to why they decided a $150 was fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.597" offset="8049768">They only had the Morgan Stanley appraisal which showed the fair value, according to Morgan, at $120.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.025" offset="8071502">But Morgan had in its possession the appraisal of Appraisal Associates which showed that the breakup value of these physical assets was $320 million just for the timberlands.</text>
