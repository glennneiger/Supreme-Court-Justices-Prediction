            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="101154">We will hear arguments first this morning in 75-616, alleged of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.085" offset="149428">Mr. Siegel you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack M. Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="15.953" offset="164893">Mr. Chief Justice may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="19.229" offset="178058">This causes here on certiorari to the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.283" offset="198225">The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.627" offset="215570">This is a zoning case, which the Circuit Court held that the refusal to rezone certain property classified for single-family use in the village of Arlington Heights, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.464" offset="286937">In so doing, the court of appeals recognized that the zoning ordinance of the village of Arlington Heights as applied to the subject property was not administered in a discriminatory matter, found that the village was attempting to protect neighboring property values and to preserve the integrity of its zoning ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.542" offset="383276">Nevertheless, the court based upon its findings at the Chicago Metropolitan Area at a segregated housing market, applied the compelling interest test and held in substance that the village had an affirmative duty to rezone the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.692" offset="455897">In light of the fact that Arlington Heights in 1970 had a population of approximately 64,000, only 27 of whom were Negros.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.429" offset="502813">The plaintiff in the case below, the respondent here is the Metropolitan Housing and Development Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.186" offset="529876">It is 'Not for Profit' Corporation established for the purpose of building low and moderate-income housing in the Chicago Metropolitan Area.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.747" offset="572090">It has a 99-year lease and purchase agreement with the clerics of St. Viators, who are the owners of the 15-acre track, which is the subject matter of this litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.834" offset="620468">The 15-acre track is part of an 80-acre track owned by St. Viators, which is presently improved for the boys’ high school in novitiate, and an old single-family dwelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.401" offset="674698">The property has been zoned as part of the 80-acre track since the beginning of zoning in Arlington Heights for single family development.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.678" offset="715763">Under the 1959 comprehensive plan of the village of Arlington Heights, the subject property was shown for single-family purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.173" offset="753797">The portion of the property, which is subject to the 99-year lease and the option to purchase consists of approximately 1,100 feet in the North and South direction and approximately 600 feet in an East and West direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.646" offset="823701">It is surrounded on all sides by the (R-3) zoning classification, and with the exception of the property also owned by St. Viators, surrounded on all sides by a single family well-established residential district.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.677" offset="891828">Under the provisions of the Arlington Heights (R-3) zoning classification, approximately 50 single family homes could be placed upon the subject property.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.291" offset="934251">The respondent sought rezoning to the (R-5), which is the multiple family classification for the purpose of establishing 190 dwelling units.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.676" offset="983779">Their contract purchase was conditioned upon rezoning and was also conditioned upon the securing of a 236 mortgage commitment under the prior Federal Housing Act 236 provided for federal assistance with respect to the construction of multiple family dwelling units.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.783" offset="1076253">I would draw the court's attention to page 115 of the exhibit volume of the appendix, in which we have a land use and zoning map indicating the physical characteristics of the surrounding area.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.089" offset="1129438">I would also point out that exhibits 11 and 14 found at pages 121 and 123 contained photographs of the surrounding area.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.124" offset="1177608">Under the provisions of the Arlington Heights zoning ordinances, high schools such as the high school alumni site, churches and monasteries or in this instance a novitiate are permitted uses under the (R-3) classification.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jack M. Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="287.509" offset="1251169">Arlington Heights lies in the North-West suburban area, approximately 23 miles from the center of the city of Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.821" offset="1280426">It has a population in 1970 of 64,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.741" offset="1300070">At the present time, we recently had a federal census, Your Honor, our population is now approximately 71,000, as I indicated in 1970, there were 27 blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.080" offset="1357435">The most recent census shows that there are now 200 blacks in Arlington Heights and 648 other non-white persons.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="322.421" stopTime="324.514">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="322.421" offset="1390767">Is it west of Evanston?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="jack_m_siegel" startTime="324.514" stopTime="829.015">
            <label>Mr. Jack M. Siegel</label>
            <text syncTime="324.514" offset="1399126">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.049" offset="1401321">It is almost directly due west of Evanston.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.575" offset="1419397">Now at the time of trial in 1973, and this matter commenced with the denial of the application for rezoning in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.068" offset="1453356">Arlington Heights had over 14,000 owner occupied single-family homes.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.857" offset="1472478">It also had more than 6,000 multiple family units in Arlington Heights, so this is not a case involved in an effort to screen out rebel units.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.790" offset="1516259">The zoning in Arlington Heights provided for an additional 9,000 multiple family units, that was on property, which was already zoned to permit multiple family dwelling units.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.545" offset="1563280">They can see rates for apartments in 1970, under the 1970 census, which was before the board when the decision was made, was over 11% vacancy in the (R-5) or the multiple family districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.543" offset="1627227">The time of trial, at least seven vacant (R-5) parcels were for sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.134" offset="1653663">Now the evident shows the village policy was to use (R-5) classification as a buffer between the single family and commercial or industrial uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.563" offset="1691384">The Village denied the zoning, the Plan Commission found in its report that the subject property would not constitute such a buffer because there was nothing to buffer it.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.281" offset="1730254">The evidence in the record showed clearly that the proposed development would have an adverse effect on additional property values in the neighborhood of 10%.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.217" offset="1765990">The property on Drury Lane, the single-family homes which back-up as indicated on our land use exhibit range in value from $50,000-70,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.937" offset="1812801">The property, South of Euclid Avenue, which is the Southern boundary of all single-family range in the area from $40,000-50,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.344" offset="1850522">Property, West of Dryden is also in the $50,000-60,000, class and the property North of Oakton which is the Northern boundary cross from the high school are relatively new homes built within five years of the trials, some homes still under construction, they also range in the $60,000-70,000 class.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.528" offset="1931188">The evidence shows also that the subject property could be economically developed for single-family homes at a price range comfortable or higher to the existing single-family homes in the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.857" offset="1972566">As a matter of fact, Mr. Kane(ph), who was the Real Estate Manager of the plaintiff, testified that except for the fact that the clerics of St. Viators wish to get $300,000, which was the purchase price for the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.163" offset="2025752">The property could have been develop for a low and moderate single family homes which were then eligible under the so called 235 Program, except that they could not afford to pay more than $200,000 for the price -- price for single family purposes, so that there is no question that this property was properly zoned in terms of its suitability.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.153" offset="2121673">The surrounding land uses all the criteria, which I indicate in my brief, that the criteria normally apply to the zoning matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.977" offset="2156991">The Trial Court found that the village was motivated by a legitimate desire to protect property values and the integrity of the zoning plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.160" offset="2189696">It found that the low-income workers do not have a constitutional right to low income housing either where they work or else where.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.717" offset="2219998">There was no evidence proving discrimination against racial minorities from the low-income persons, generally, and the Trail Court found that there were no specific violations of the fair housing act or the civil rights act, and that there was no violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.687" offset="2283841">The Court of Appeals as I have indicated found that the findings of the Trial Court should not be disturb in an essence said, that the villagers -- reasons for rezoning were the protection of property values, were for the preservation of the integrity of the zoning ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.115" offset="2377569">The court specifically found that the evidence did not support the finding that the villagers administering its buffer policy and discriminatory matter, found that the trial courts determination was not clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.876" offset="2428560">The Court Of Appeals also recognized that merely because racial minority has constituted a higher percentage of low and moderate income category, did not mean that the refusal to rezone at the type of racially discriminatory effect that required the implication of a compelling interest test.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.270" offset="2498150">But to my mind, illogically, it then preceded to rely upon what it judicially determined was the segregated housing market in the Chicago Metropolitan Area and compelled, and applied that the compelling interest test.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.651" offset="2567740">Now the villagers’ position in this matter is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.659" offset="2587698">We take the position about the fact that the zoning ordinance may have a greater impact upon the poor or a minority group, does not thereby, invalidate it or cause it to be a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.914" offset="2656765">The evidence indicated that in the standard metropolitan area, that is a six county area around Chicago, approximately 40% of the blacks who resided in that area would be eligible for the housing which was proposed here, low and moderate income housing—the so called Lincoln Green project.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.984" offset="2753001">There is no evidence that anyone has ever been denied housing in Arlington Heights because of their race, as a matter of fact, the answers to interrogatories indicated Arlington Heights was the first community in North-West suburban area to adapt a fair housing ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.085" offset="2817471">Mr. D.V Zay(ph), a demographer, who testified for MHDC, testified that based upon the economics of the situation, approximately 5% of the housing units in Arlington Heights were available to blacks in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, and that -- if housing was determined solely for economic reasons, there would be a black population in excess of 3,200 blacks in Arlington Heights.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.477" offset="2947038">This indicates to our mind at least that it was the economic situation and not the zoning, nothing that the village of Arlington Heights has done by way of zoning which has in anyway impaired the rights of blacks to live in Arlington Heights.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.144" offset="3017673">We believe therefore that what the Court Of Appeals has done is applied one set of zoning criteria for so called white housing, and another set of criteria for housing which may contain black or poor people.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.477" offset="3094996">We believe that under the decisions of this court, in Lindsey v. Normet, or Rodriguez and the other cases, which I have cited in my brief, there is no fundamental constitutional right to housing, and that the court erred in applying the compelling interest test.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.687" offset="3155809">The proper test, we believe following Belle Terre and Euclid is the test of rational relationship to a permissible state objective, and we believe that the zoning ordinance bears such a rational relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="781.616" offset="3227593">We also believe that under the criteria which has been established for the decision of zoning cases, the surrounding land use, zoning suitability of the property for the purposes zoned, the presumption of validity that the MHDC failed to overcome the presumption of validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.430" offset="3298855">We believe that the court should not substitute its judgment for that of the legislative body or that the federal court should set as a super zoning board.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.615" offset="3335531">The ordinance is patently reasonable, I think that Your Honors, will determine by simply looking at the land use map and at the photographs indicating the actual uses in place.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.349" offset="3378476">The ordinance is not on its phase or in fact aimed at a racial or economic minority.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.290" offset="3402300">It is a valid exercise of legislative discretion and it should not...</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.496" offset="4403103">It is our position that the failure to grant the rezoning request did not violate the Civil Rights Act to the Fair Housing Law or the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.697" offset="4431838">Any other decision would have been spot zoning or just destroyed the integrity of our zoning plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.663" offset="4459737">The property is clearly suitable for single-family purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.369" offset="4474574">The Trial Court also found that there was no discrimination involved in this case and the Courts Of Appeals refused to set aside that finding and fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.149" offset="4525670">We believe that the Fourteenth Amendment and that the Civil Rights Act and Fair Housing Act does not protect purported discrimination based upon economics, that this is essentially a garden variety zoning case in which the argument is made, that because of single-family zoning, poor people cannot reside on that property and that there is a percentage of poor people who are black, and therefore, according to the respondents, this is a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.200" offset="4645938">Now, this argument has been raised in this court in other connections, San Antonio School District case, Rodriguez case, Lindsey versus Normet, James v. Valtierra, Palmer v. Thompson, and then, the Court of Appeals of various districts including the Aseveto and the Mahaley housing authority case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.651" offset="4719707">We believe that Court of Appeals held at low income persons have special privileges to have low income housing, if there is a possibility or the higher percentage of minorities will be in their number.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.428" offset="4766832">We do not believe there is any basis in the Fourteenth Amendment for this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.069" offset="4785327">The fact that the zoning ordinance may have a greater impact upon the poor or minority group clearly does not invalidate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.690" offset="4811867">Most recent case, which I have cited in my supplemental brief is Washington v. Davis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.915" offset="4832765">There is no affirmative duty, we believed, under the Fourteenth Amendment to change a valid zoning ordinance, absent a showing of purposeful discrimination simply to accommodate low income people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.248" offset="4890130">We believe that Milliken v. Bradley, and Washington v. Davis clearly establishes this fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.814" offset="4912387">The fact that as I said, enforcement in ordinance may have a greater impact on the poor, does not render invalid under the Equal Protection Clause, under the teachings of this court; court in James v. Valtierra.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.229" offset="4958049">As a matter fact in Warth v. Seldin, which we rely on, on the standing case, I believe this court specifically said that the failure of low income people to reside in that suburban community was based on their economic situation and could be based upon their economic situation and not upon any zoning pattern.</text>

            <text syncTime="1267.236" offset="5170058">Quite out of course, that the owners of the property have never been a party to this lawsuit, The Clerics of St. Viator, who would loose presumably $300,000 their purchase price if the zoning was not granted or the commitment was not received.</text>

            <text syncTime="1286.726" offset="5248008">Yes sir, but at least in Illinois, it is typical to have a property owner enjoined and as I indicated the Illinois Supreme Court in the Clark case had the situation where only the contract purchaser was carrying out the litigation and not the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.363" offset="5310597">They specifically held that since the contract purchaser really had nothing to loose by a way of the failure to receive zoning, that they have no standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.061" offset="5357304">Also I think the trial court pointed out that merely because MHDC was organized for the purpose of low and moderate income housing, it did not have any special racial characteristics under the Fourteenth Amendment and should be treated the same as any other corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1351.362" offset="5506516">In this instance, it would have been a so called plan development in the property could only be developed in accordance with the specific plan, but there is no statutory or case requirement in Illinois under the commitment for the developer to go ahead and the trial court indicated after reaching the decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.227" offset="5582062">It would be reluctant to grant any relief because the fact that 236 Program was dead and this was simply a rezoned property and opened it up to any of the uses permitted under the R-5 classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.492" offset="5635038">And we believe that the ordinance is presumed valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1407.288" offset="5730228">We believe as I have indicated that the respondents lack of standing to bring this action for the reason that these are non-residents, not residing in Arlington Heights, no showing that this was a class action, that the intervene or Mrs. Maldonado resided in Arlington Heights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.093" offset="5809432">The other intervene are the North West Opportunity Center is a welfare organization funded in part by the Village of Arlington Heights and part by the federal government, who are there to take care of the low income people in Chicago Metropolitan Area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.743" offset="5864080">Testimony of Mr. Newton, who is their director, was that at the time of trial, there were 188 low-income families in Arlington Heights that there were approximately 1500 in the Arlington Heights area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.215" offset="5921967">Many of them were Spanish surnamed and Mexican, originally migratory workers who had settled there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.341" offset="5954463">Mrs. Maldonado clearly does not zoned out of the village because Mrs. Maldonado lives in the village.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.994" offset="5985079">Therefore your Honors, it is our hope that this Court will not elevate or degrade the Fourteenth Amendment into the proposition that there is one set of zoning laws for all people except the poor or the minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.014" offset="6073164">The Village of Arlington Heights then we emphasize, has not discriminated, this trial court so found that as the matter of fact, the trial court was correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="2525.674" offset="10203750">It met all the criteria and in 60 other cases Your Honor, they had approved other zoning and counsel has referred to the maps, these zonings are all over Arlington Heights and 53 of those abut single-family homes and in some cases, they abut much fancier single-family homes than are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.069" offset="10285356">The process in Arlington Heights is to approve all these zonings everywhere except where ours is and although the Court found that there was not a yet wall type of violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2556.497" offset="10327048">The Court did find that their process of approving was not uniformly followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.886" offset="10352648">To compare it, let us say to Washington v. Davis, this would be like giving a police test whenever you thought you should and whenever whites failed it allowing them to be on the force, but when blacks fails it not allowing them to be on the force, that is the situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2576.537" offset="10407296">Sometimes they apply the test to white developments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.324" offset="10418372">Sometimes they turn down white developments for certain reasons, but whenever the development comes in it would be racially innovated, then this test is used to keep them out and that is the process of what sometimes referred to as a holding pattern zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.691" offset="10479916">Everything is held as R-3.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.092" offset="10489425">When someone comes in on our pride like these 60 other cases, they then approve them after looking at who the developer is; whether, it can be assured that that developer will bring in the right people and whether or not it should be approved, but in 53 of those cases, the argument that is made here that it abuts single families was disregarded completely.</text>

            <text syncTime="3010.073" offset="12141409">The situation with respect to the zoning and the preparation of the Arlington Heights development indicates that in comparison to the other developments that were further approved, it would meet the general requirements of the municipality and that the zoning could have been approved in the accordance with the procedures that were followed by the municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.123" offset="12245585">We believe that the evidence does show that there was substantial purpose on the part of the municipality and that the evidence shows further that they did not present any facts or reasonable explanation as to why the development had been turned down and that is part of the totality effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.439" offset="12342865">We also, in connection with the descent, we have reviewed the record and the record indicates that none of the seven or nine parcels were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.740" offset="12380063">Both of Mr. Kane’s testimony where he indicates the prices of these, some of them were $50,000 an acre, some of them $42,000 an acre, indicates there were no other R-5 parcel zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.866" offset="12428547">That it could have been used because of the $2,000 limit per unit under HUD.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.000" offset="12449131">Mr. Apelko, their own appraiser indicated that $20,000 was the only parcel he knew for single-family in Arlington Heights and the multiple-family would all be hired in that and therefore priced out of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.580" offset="12511407">Several of the seven parcels were too small; they were five or six units.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.781" offset="12536276">In others, we have flooding problems and the others were not for sale or were overpriced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.946" offset="12556860">There was just no other opportunity, and besides that the only way this development can be dealt, is where the opportunity comes along that a religious order such as the clerics of St. Viators makes this property available to a particular developer and with that property available to the developer, the opportunity to make this housing available opportunity bases arises.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.086" offset="12653409">MHDC built a similar project for low and moderate income people, 212 units.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.432" offset="12682875">They have been involved in other developments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.769" offset="12692174">They have a record of showing, they can bring in minorities and whites to provide a truly integrated development and that is what would be done here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3158.203" offset="12733866">That is why these people are on the boards of directors of the leadership council and MHDC are working so hard on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.285" offset="12762287">We urge the Court to affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals as being in accordance with Washington v. Davis and meeting the general framework where required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3176.014" offset="12805128">The question on motivation and purpose needs further inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.728" offset="12819965">One opportunity would be to go back and to go into that, but we feel that is not necessary on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.531" offset="12843267">We urge the Court to allow that Court of Appeals opinion to stand so that we can get on with building what we believe will be a very fine and helpful development in the village of Arlington Heights.</text>

            <text syncTime="3201.142" offset="12905647">Yes sir, if the court pleases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.669" offset="12919753">I would point out first of all that the village of Arlington Heights rejected 34 applications for multiple housing, which did not involve low or moderate income housing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.780" offset="12964266">Simply because they did not meet the criteria of our planning principles including the buffer zone, which the trial court and the Court of Appeals found we were applying in an non-discriminatory manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.730" offset="13015988">As a matter of fact, as Mr. Caruso says you will find that some of those 60 approvals were contiguous to single family zoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.700" offset="13047858">There is no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.649" offset="13051724">That is the whole idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.994" offset="13057053">You use multiple-family as a buffer between more intense and single-family development.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.385" offset="13082653">I would point out that there own witness Mr. D.V. Zay characterized Arlington Heights as a dormitory suburb and it had the least industry, the least commerce of the communities around it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.341" offset="13138450">So when Mr. Caruso says all the jobs are moving to Arlington Heights, his own witness does not believe that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.100" offset="13165513">Now, the fact of the matter is that the record showed that Mr. Hansen, the village manager, and Mr. Kessler, the village planner were prepared and offered to find other sites for MHDC in Arlington Heights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3282.660" offset="13231760">The 212-unit project, which is the only new project they have ever built, is located three quarters of a mile away from Arlington Heights, much closer to our industrial area than Lincoln Green is, so that they are in the Arlington Heights area now and they have no problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.490" offset="13295081">Now, when Mr. Caruso says that there has been an effort to zone out blacks here, this is just not the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.585" offset="13319427">We have permitted over 6,000 apartment units.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.424" offset="13334787">Mr. Kessler testified that those apartments range from a $160 a month up.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.077" offset="13361432">There were over 6,000 apartments and an additional 9,000 zoned at the time of trial.</text>
