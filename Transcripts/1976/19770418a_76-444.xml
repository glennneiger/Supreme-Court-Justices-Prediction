            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100545">We will hear arguments first this morning in no. 76-444, Northeast Marine Terminal against Caputo, consolidated with 76-454, International Terminal against Blundo.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.358" offset="205975">Mr. Kimball, I think you may proceed when you are ready?</text>

            <label>Mr. William M. Kimball</label>
            <text syncTime="29.414" offset="218201">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.067" offset="228754">These consolidated cases present first impression questions as to the meaning and scope of the status and situs 1972 amendments to Sections 2(3) and 3(a) of the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.511" offset="326556">Petitioners in 76-444 whom I represent, have always conceded that there is no situs question in their case and so I hope to be permitted to limit my remarks to the status question.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.286" offset="417672">These consolidated cases present the status question in two distinguishable fact situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.669" offset="463125">In 76-444, the employee Caputo was helping load a consignee’s truck with break bulk boxes of cheese.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.849" offset="523938">In 76-454, employee E. Blundo was tallying cargo which was being removed from a shipping container.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.894" offset="576078">Therefore, I hope to be allowed to focus my remarks on whether employees doing this sort of work which Mr. Caputo was doing, truck loading work have the coverage status.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.555" offset="658729">Now, the threshold question is whether I may properly focus solely upon the work which Mr. Caputo was doing when he was injured or whether as did the majority below.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.971" offset="736365">I must also consider the fact that on other occasions, Mr. Caputo spent a significant part of his time aboard ships doing the traditional loading and discharging work of a longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.563" offset="814733">Neither the Administrative Law Judge nor the Benefits Review Board paid any attention whatsoever nor even mentioned what Mr. Caputo did on other occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.552" offset="882651">The Administrative Law Judge specifically fixed Mr. Caputo’s status at the time of the injury and the board affirmed on the ground that at that time, he was loading and discharging a ship and not loading a truck as Judge Widener discerned in a similar fact situation in the Adkins case which is initially cited on page 5 of petitioner’s blue covered brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.393" offset="1018070">The legislative history is not crystal clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.515" offset="1038550">The majority below and the First and Third Circuit Courts of Appeals have held that status should not be determined solely as of the time of injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.774" offset="1091631">The Fifth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals have held to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.067" offset="1116813">This court in decisions prior to the 1972 amendments, has held that Section 3(a) situs, Section 2(2) injury in the course of employment and Section 2(3), Section 3(a)(1) exclusion of crew members must all be determined at the time of injury and not with reference to what the employee generally did on other occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.484" offset="1254426">It’s suggested on our brief that it would be anomalous, if Section 2(3) employee status were determined on the basis of what the man generally did, but then he was excluded under the same Section because of what he was particularly doing on an occasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.073" offset="1348780">It is further suggested on our brief that the general functional criteria will be almost appallingly difficult to administer and adjudicate for reasons which we have suggested at pages 10 and 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.116" offset="1420983">Now, the federal respondent has distorted our first point by suggesting that longshoremen who are working on a ship and who are obviously covered by both the old and the new Act would not be covered while they were using the ship’s toilet facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.294" offset="1525681">They would be, because of the work they were doing or had been assigned to do, and they would also be covered while they were taking a coffee break aboard the ship because of the work which they had been assigned to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.778" offset="1607601">Although the federal respondent makes an important concession that Congress’ express intent to extend coverage “To employees who would otherwise be covered by this Act for part of their activity implies that only persons who might have been partly covered under the old Act are covered under the new Act and parenthetically I would respectfully suggest to the court that in context of what I had just quoted by this Act” pretty clearly means by the old Act which the committee was looking to amend.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.735" offset="1791399">As I say although the federal respondent makes that important concession, it argues that because of what it says is the risky task of cargo handling on the waterfront, all “physical” cargo handling activity within the statutory situs confers statutory status.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.948" offset="1908323">We have a stipulation in 76-444 that the work which the employee was doing, namely loading cheese in a consignee’s truck with the assistance of a dolly, had the same risk factor wherever trucks are loaded or unloaded with dollies.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.662" offset="2003095">Now, presumably the government’s suggestion that there should be a limitation on physical activity was meant to exclude clerical employees on the situs who as Judge Friendly wrote, are not covered even by the most liberal construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.847" offset="2095882">I should add also parenthetically that in a considerable number of un-appealed Benefits Review Board decisions, the Board has held that clerical personnel are covered by the amendments.</text>

            <text syncTime="825.933" offset="3404199">It goes along with marine railway.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.923" offset="3428232">Now, adapting a suggestion in the Third Circuit Johns’ case, the federal respondent argues that congress’ inclusion of “employees who pick up, I say inclusion on this book myself and badly so, and this gets into why we don’t cover telephone operators perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.811" offset="3515689">Congress specifically excluded “employees who pick up stored cargo for further transshipment.”</text>
            <text syncTime="866.555" offset="3566681">The government respondent argues that that must necessarily mean truck men who received delivery of cargo for further overland transportation, but that interpretation makes the last two sentences of the committee report, which are quoted on page 5 of the appendix to the Blue covered brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="889.123" offset="3656960">It makes those last two sentences idiotically redundant and it ignores the fact that by statutory definition, those truck men are not covered by the Act because the trucking companies are not statutory employers as defined by Section 2(4) of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.440" offset="3762285">And I would like to point out, because we had read these things so many times and the words escape us unless we read them over and over, but it is interesting to note the distinction which the committee is making and I think inarguably with a malice aforethought if you please, on this fifth page, they talk up there towards the top, does employees, thinking in terms of statutory employees, whose responsibility is only to pick up stored cargo and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.057" offset="3892689">Then they talk down the last two sentences about individuals and they talk not about employers, but they are talking about persons and then they make an interesting distinction, at the very last two lines they talk about navigable waters which under the expansive situs definition, we know includes shore installations of discharge that Mr. Justice was remarking about, but here they draw a distinction between navigable waters and pier adjoining navigable waters, which under the amended definition is part of navigable waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.339" offset="4117864">Now the federal respondent has made some diversionary suggestions which I respectfully submit both to the federal respondent and to this Honorable Court are less than helpful.</text>

            <text syncTime="1048.123" offset="4292989">I draw from that, if Your Honor pleases that the last two sentences of the report are an effort to indicate that truck men who are employed by trucking companies are not intended to be included.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.816" offset="4419735">Therefore, in an earlier part of the report, when the committee excludes employees whose responsibility is only to pick up stored cargo for further transshipment, they are not talking about truck men or employees of trucking companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.399" offset="4486086">They are talking about somebody else and I respectfully suggest that they are talking about people like Caputo or indeed people who are performing functions like Mr. Blundo which Mr. Prettyman will talk about in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.158" offset="4553169">These defense based Act citations, I suggest are not helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.067" offset="4572813">The court has held that being injured at a defense based Act situs is not sufficient to entitle an employee to compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.678" offset="4615236">The decisions which the government has cited hold that the injury must result from a zone of special danger risk at the defense based situs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.853" offset="4663928">We know by stipulation that Mr. Caputo was not performing any high risk longshoring activity, for which as the majority below conceded the Act is intended to compensate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.719" offset="4727353">The federal respondent pleads for deference to the Benefit Review Board, consistent administrating of interpretation, which as I have, I hope not offensively, suggested to the court and as is recognized by the majority below, is a bootstrap operation by the Board wherein they started off the first day, expanding this Act, I think beyond meaning and as illustrated in the reply brief in 76-454, the Board has given virtually no heed to any status or situs limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1220.667" offset="4983144">I suggest for instance that if you expand the statute to the ultimate limits then no one is ever going to be able to sue under the authority of this court’s decision in Gutierrez, no one is going to be able to sue a ship owner for damages because of an un-seaworthy cargo container nor is a railroad employee is going to be able to sue.</text>

            <text syncTime="1252.678" offset="5111249">I am Barrett Prettyman and I represent the International Terminal Operating Company which I will call ITO, the employer of the injured employee, Mr. Blundo in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.014" offset="5164538">ITO really wears two hats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.141" offset="5177077">It is a stevedoring company whose traditional job is to load and unload a vessel, but it is also a terminal operator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.889" offset="5216052">It employs terminal workers and warehouseman to do the remaining work that needs to be done on a terminal after the ship is loaded or unloaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.471" offset="5254400">Mr. Blundo is a checker and had been for some five years with ITO.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.728" offset="5275402">Interestingly, checkers also wear two hats.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.189" offset="5297241">A checker can be at the vessel’s edge checking the seal for example of containers as they come off the vessel and he is part of the longshoring operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.831" offset="5343843">He checks those containers as they are lowered as they first hit the pier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.464" offset="5374354">That is the checker “directly involved in the loading or unloading functions” that Congress referred to in their reports and those are the checkers that they said were going to be covered and of course we contend that they were going to be covered because they are part of the loading or unloading process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.573" offset="5466827">But Mr. Blundo at the time of the accident and most of the other time was wearing his other hat as a checker, that is, he was engaged some distance away from where the loading and unloading had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1359.008" offset="5536522">He was removed both distance and by function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.666" offset="5551151">He was at a different terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.211" offset="5561286">A substantial period of time had passed since the container that he was working had been unloaded and this particular container was being stripped in a warehouse used for customs inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1381.452" offset="5626279">His sole job was to break the seal and as the contents were unloaded by strippers, he was to check them against his manifest to make sure that the contents inside the container corresponded with the manifest that he had and were the right things.</text>

            <text syncTime="2044.953" offset="8280320">I see where the difficulty lies and I apologize for confusing you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.480" offset="8294426">When I began talking about a checker wearing two hats, I was talking about checkers in general.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.806" offset="8315742">Checkers in general wear two hats in the sense that they can be doing one of two types of jobs, one at the ship’s edge and the other at some distant terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.123" offset="8357015">Now, this particular man was working at the time of injury at the distant terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.554" offset="8378749">We do have evidence that is part of a proffer that is not actually proof, but part of a proffer, that he did spend on other occasions up to 20% of his time on lighters or onboard a ship, but we have no indication that how long ago this was or what the precise nature of that work was or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.101" offset="8460878">This man so far as this record is concerned was wearing the second hat that I was talking about and was far removed from the unloading process and I would like to point out to you in that regard that Congress specifically said in the report that I was just referring to you that checkers were covered only if they were directly involved in the loading or unloading process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.538" offset="8558681">Now, that statement simply makes no sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.257" offset="8569547">If you adapt the view for example of the Benefit Review Board, that it does not make any difference where a checker is or what he is doing or whether you have a clerical worker or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.643" offset="8607059">Let me just give you an example of the extent to which the Benefit Review Board is going.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.464" offset="8626390">Despite these statements in here, at least eight statements, eight statements in the legislative history that I have just referred you to which severely qualify the extension of compensation and made clear that Congress was not attempting to cover the entire terminal of the entire universe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.150" offset="8709041">Despite that, the Benefit Review Board has said that a temporary delivery clerk who slipped on ice between the parking lot and the time clock checking it out was covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.868" offset="8755957">They have said that a man who trips over a beam while returning to a work shack with his men’s time cards is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.474" offset="8782393">They have said that a fellow who injures his back while replacing paper in an IBM machine is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.568" offset="8802769">Now, if you take those examples and I want to emphasize that the government apparently backs the Benefit Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="2182.101" offset="8828891">They say a number of times in their brief that they are truly backing them, if you take those statements and you compare them with statements in the legislative history that says that for example, there is a transfer to the storage or holding area and if it is not unloading or loading it is not covered even if the injury occurs in that area or that if an employee engaged only in transshipment which can only mean in context to taking from the holding area or the first point of rest to another point of the terminal, if he is engage in transshipment he is not covered they say that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2709.820" offset="10939794">He does not know in advance when he gets to that pier, exactly where he is going to be assigned.</text>

            <text syncTime="2733.644" offset="11035089">Not only that, if he is assigned in the morning to unload a Lighter and that work is finished and the Lighter is finished, his extra labor boss may then say unload the trucks that are delivering cargo that have to be put onboard a vessel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.276" offset="11101649">The same way with the checker, the checker does not know in advance each day where he will be assigned.</text>

            <text syncTime="3053.577" offset="12314775">There was a Scafidi case, which was involved in the Della Ventura case was dismissed for technicalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.585" offset="12342883">In that particular case, an employer had been moving, the Piston Stevedoring Company had been moving its pier from one location to another, which was within 10 blocks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.372" offset="12385933">So rather than hire a private trucking for all of the existing cargo that was remaining on pier 10 to go to the state pier or pier 12, I do not remember the number of the pier, they used their own drivers to go across city streets and within the terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.191" offset="12449254">In the Scafidi case, of course he was injured after he got inside of the terminal and was opening the container for the purposes of re-stuffing them into another container, so that the Administrative Law Judge held that to be compensable and the Benefits Review Board also held it to be compensable, but taking your example, if he had been hurt between pier 10 and pier 12, I would say under those particular set of circumstances that he would also be covered under the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3303.674" offset="13315161">I wanted to make a point that Section 9(20) which deals with presumptions should be continued to be enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.972" offset="13352359">The average longshoreman cannot afford the proceedings to prosecute these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.308" offset="13377750">All of the costs of these proceedings are born by me personally and my firm of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.942" offset="13404290">So that the purpose of the law was that the burden of proof should be on the employers and their carriers because they were best able to sustain the cost of prosecuting these claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.210" offset="13457371">All a person has to do, who is injured on the waterfront, is to say, I am a longshoreman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.969" offset="13480359">I was working on the job and I got hurt and my employer engages longshoreman to work on the ship and on the piers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.709" offset="13515363">Now, the burden is on the employer and carrier to come forth and disprove that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.010" offset="13540545">You will notice in both these cases, the Caputo case they presented no evidence of what so ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.593" offset="13566876">In the Blundo case they attempted to present some evidence in the form of a safety man, whose knowledge of the facts seem to be faulty, but in any event, there is no proof to the contrary or of any record that this does not fall within the presumption of the Act, also the other phase of the law which says that if there are serious questions of fact and law then it is to be resolved in favor of the claimant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.591" offset="13678889">Well is this not what is occurring here now?</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.028" offset="13692578">There is a serious question of fact and law and if that is truly bothering you gentlemen it has to be resolved in favor of the claimant because that is what the law has been for many, many years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.492" offset="13754436">Another misconception, I am sorry to jump back and forth, but my adversary, Mr. Prettyman says that it almost never happens that ships are unloaded directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.203" offset="13801352">It happens quite often.</text>
            <text syncTime="3426.096" offset="13804904">It happens in two instances that I know of, banana ships and frozen cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.733" offset="13831445">They are perishable items.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.101" offset="13840849">So that if that has to be unloaded the same longshoreman, Mr. Caputo, Mr. Blundo, are used in a direct line from the ship directly into the consignee’s truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.208" offset="13893303">They have to use the longshoreman to load their trucks because they require special heavy equipment such as high-lows, dollies and manual labor to put it into the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.397" offset="13946070">A truck man cannot possibly carry all these equipment with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.207" offset="13961325">It is recognized on the waterfront that this is the way it has to be done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.422" offset="13978148">The only reason that the truck man participates is otherwise the employer is paying him to do nothing and watch the truck being loaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.940" offset="14012212">So he tells him you have to help.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.637" offset="14023079">The word transshipment used by the committee reports in the House and in the Senate meant exactly that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.458" offset="14062367">An employer does not transship within his own terminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.659" offset="14091102">Somebody else does it, takes it outside of.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.013" offset="14104581">You do not move furniture in your own house from upstairs to downstairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.104" offset="14124956">That is not moving away from your house and moving the cargo away from the terminal, somebody else does it and it is that person who picks it up that was intended to be excluded.</text>

            <text syncTime="3695.112" offset="14880940">But it seems tolerably clear that the focus of the statute was upon the occupation of the worker.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.629" offset="14911033">The description of longshoreman and the other description in section 2(3) of the statute is a description of the occupations in which persons engage on the waterfront.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.289" offset="14945619">Longshoreman, harbor worker, ship repair man, it is a focus on occupations rather than a focus on particular tasks at the moment of the injury and that focus on occupation, rather than on tasks at the moment of injury is sufficient to doom petitioner’s theories and arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.776" offset="15023569">The occupation of longshoreman traditionally has been understood to include a wide variety of waterfront tasks.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.142" offset="15053035">In Victory Carriers against Law, for example, this court used longshoreman in that generic sense to include the persons who carry out most tasks on the waterfront.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.830" offset="15099846">And there is no reason to suppose that Congress, which enacted this statute only a few months later and in some measure in response to this court’s decision in Victory Carriers and Nacirema Operating Company was using longshoreman in some more narrow sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3765.258" offset="15161495">All of this too, must be considered against the fact that a maritime carrier employs Stevedore contractors and marine terminal operators like petitioners to carry out its duty to make cargo available to consignees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.511" offset="15218547">The task is Maritime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.421" offset="15226174">It is the marine carrier who engages petitioners to carry out tasks on its behalf and it pays for their services.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.645" offset="15255118">The ultimate responsibility is that of the marine carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.820" offset="15267761">Petitioners act on their behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.273" offset="15277583">We have discussed this duty at pages 27 to 28 of our brief and this has caused some difference of view I think, between the two petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.418" offset="15314155">Petitioner North East concedes at pages 18 and 19 of its brief that this duty exists and that the coverage of the act, therefore, continues until the marine terminal or the Stevedore contractor has carried out that duty of making cargo available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.999" offset="15376535">Since Blundo was injured before cargo was made available, under the test advocated by petitioner North East, Blundo would be covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3828.954" offset="15416346">Petitioner’s contrary argument takes us a long way from the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3836.609" offset="15446961">The counsels for petitioners were not talking about longshoreman and longshoring operations during their oral argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="5037.460" offset="20250357">Yes Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5039.956" offset="20260284">Ultimately the test comes down to what the statute is has aimed at.</text>
            <text syncTime="5044.684" offset="20279196">We think the statute is aimed at the interface between land and water transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="5049.556" offset="20298736">The occupations involved in moving cargo between one mode of transportation and another.</text>
            <text syncTime="5056.645" offset="20327053">The whole stevedoring and marine terminal industry exists to provide that interface.</text>

            <text syncTime="5074.173" offset="20397165">They were the central beneficiaries of the statute and the awards in their favor should be upheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="5080.318" offset="20421721">Perhaps there is uncertainty in this.</text>
            <text syncTime="5082.890" offset="20432065">To the extent there is, we believe that they are entitled to the assistance of three time tested principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="5089.220" offset="20457352">One, the presumption of coverage in section 20(a) of the statute, two the rule of liberal construction for a medial statutes and the presumption of coverage in the statutes indicates that this is one of those statutes and three, the difference due to the agency charged with the administration of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5108.829" offset="20535823">These principles mean at the minimum that uncertainties in the scope of coverage of the statute should be resolved in favor of coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5117.836" offset="20571872">Petitioner’s arguments raised no more than uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="5121.102" offset="20584934">They harp upon ambiguities and they offer plausible tests to resolve those ambiguities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5127.479" offset="20610429">But the Board too has offered plausible tests to resolve any ambiguities.</text>
            <text syncTime="5132.307" offset="20629760">Its test is more in harmony with the statute and its legislative history and we believe that the awards in this case were proper.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="5166.855" offset="20767895">A few brief points if it pleases the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="5170.049" offset="20780643">First of all I do not know of a single decision of the Benefit Review Board that has denied compensation to any clerical worker of any kind who was injured and I now understand the government to be fully supporting the position of the Benefit Review Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="5186.401" offset="20846054">You will notice in their brief there was some confusion there because they were talking about people who physically handled cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="5191.855" offset="20867892">They apparently now have abandoned that requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="5194.588" offset="20878863">Anyone who is on the terminal working and employed is going to be covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5199.833" offset="20899866">No. 2, the government shows some perplexity about point of rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5204.339" offset="20917838">One of the respondents in these cases is a Director of the Office of Workers’ Compensation Programs of the Department of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="5211.707" offset="20947304">He is a respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="5214.097" offset="20956917">That very office issued a report just last December.</text>
            <text syncTime="5219.003" offset="20976457">The government has never referred to that report in its briefs although we referred to it and quoted it in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="5226.225" offset="21005401">It is interesting that in that report there does not seem to be any confusion about point of rest because the Department of Labor there says, the respondent in this case their says, “The marine terminal operator is responsible for all movement and handling of the ship’s cargo between the point of rest and any place on the marine terminal property except the shipside.”</text>
            <text syncTime="5251.795" offset="21107696">And the respondent in this case also says Stevedore operations are confined to the area between the ship and the terminal area called point of rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="5262.669" offset="21151164">So, I suggest to you that when Mr. Justice Rehnquist asked which of the attorneys we should listen to as to the difficulties of the case and the phrases and so forth, I suggest we should listen in at least in this regard to the respondent who is certainly is an expert as to what the point of rest is, Mr. Easterbrook.</text>
            <text syncTime="5283.450" offset="21234338">And I might say incidentally that as to point of rest, you do not go back and forth across the point of rest as has been described in oral argument because we are talking about a function here and not a geographical point.</text>
            <text syncTime="5298.437" offset="21294210">If a man is engaged in the loading and unloading process, if he is part of the gang for example, it makes know difference whether he walks back and forth on the other side of the marshalling area or not, if he is engaged in the unloading process by way of example, he is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="5315.546" offset="21362651">Now, as the exact point of physical point of rest may in fact change from terminal to terminal or yard to yard as the government has suggested, but it does not make any difference because in each yard, at each terminal the point is exactly fixed and believe me, there is no confusion at each place as to exactly where the point of rest is as he has described himself using those examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="5343.243" offset="21473515">It does not make any difference that geographically it may be different in Los Angeles than it is in New York, if in fact it is fixed in each place and everyone knows where it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="5353.029" offset="21512594">Let me just finally say, that I think the statement was made that unloading and loading was not specifically referred to in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="5363.861">If that was there, I refer you to Section 2(4) where it is referred to, Section 3(a) where it is referred to and four times during the reports that I have repeatedly referred you to, they specifically talk about the loading and unloading function.</text>
            <text syncTime="5381.666">Thank you very much.</text>
