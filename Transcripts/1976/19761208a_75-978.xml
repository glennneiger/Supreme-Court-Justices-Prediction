            <label>Mr. Robert C. Barnard</label>
            <text syncTime="34.761" offset="239516">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.188" offset="257280">These three consolidated cases present basic statutory issues as to the form and content of regulations under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 for existing sources, that is, existing plants, and for new sources, that is, new plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.813" offset="327706">The regulations under which these issues arise concern the inorganic chemical-manufacturing industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.696" offset="355291">Petitions in No. 978 and 1483 present the issue whether the regulations by EPA for existing plants shall be guidelines for effluent limitations as Section 304(b) expressly commands or whether EPA, relying on authority said to be derived by implication from Section 301, can override the provisions of Section 304 and issue effluent limitations, which shall be mechanically cranked into every permit, regardless of the circumstances or the conditions of the plant in the category.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.943" offset="504294">The resolution of these statutory issues provides the basis for the determination of a jurisdictional issue which is also present in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.607" offset="538880">The question presented on the cross-petition in No. 1705 relates to the issue whether EPA’s regulations should, as the court below held, provide a safety-valve procedure, in the court’s words, enabling an individual plant to show that it is entitled to a variance from a single-number standard because of the special circumstances of that particular plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.956" offset="652356">There is no jurisdictional issue on 1705.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.205" offset="665312">The statute expressly provides for review in the Court of Appeals of new source standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.133" offset="689032">The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 made radical changes in the manner in which both municipal and private plant effluents are controlled.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.197" offset="733231">The court in the last term in the California case had occasion to consider this Act in detail; I shall therefore merely thumbnail-sketch the statutory plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.537" offset="770638">Section 301 of the Act prohibits all discharges by plants except as the discharge is authorized and covered by a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.919" offset="808150">Section 301 states, quote, “To carry out the objectives of the Act, there shall be achieved, by 1977, effluent limitations for point sources requiring the installation of best practicable control technology currently available.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.121" offset="884950">For 1983, effluent limitations requiring application of best available technology economically achievable.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.652" offset="923089">Section 301 expressly provides that these requirements are to be defined and determined pursuant to regulations under Section 304(b) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.672" offset="975229">The primary means of achieving and enforcing the effluent limitation is a permit procedure under Section 402, where the regulations are applied to individual plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.084" offset="1028832">The regulatory scheme for new sources is similar, but has important differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.472" offset="1050357">Section 306 of the Act directs EPA to establish standards of performance, not guidelines, for new sources which meet the statutory technological requirement of best available demonstrated control technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.520" offset="1118589">These standards are also applied to individual plants in the course of a permit process.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.939" offset="1144294">I will address first these issues as concerned regulations for existing plants and the jurisdictional issue that is related, I will then turn to the issues as they relate to new sources on the cross-petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.345" offset="1197897">Before discussing these matters, perhaps I should explain what appears to be the procedural complexity that is apparent in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.563" offset="1234782">The complexity arises, because in February 1974, about a year-and-a-half after the statute was passed, EPA first announced its position that it had implied authority to issue regulations under Section 301 establishing limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.277" offset="1305626">The regulations in the form of single-number limitations would be issued, EPA said, under both Sections 301 and 304(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="310.371" offset="1341988">At the same time, EPA announced that since these regulations were to be issued under 301, the exclusive review provisions of Section 509(b) would be applicable and the 90-day period within which petitions must be filed would be equally applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.873" offset="1424013">Petitioners disagree with EPA’s view that it has implied authority to issue limitations which override or disregard the express commands in Section 304(b) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.180" offset="1469257">We likewise disagree with EPA on exclusive jurisdiction to review under Section 509; however, because of EPA’s announced position, petitioners filed protective petitions for review in the Court of Appeals at the same time as the petitions for review of the new-source standards for file.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.402" offset="1546057">Petitioners also filed a complaint in the Western District of Virginia, challenging certainty of the inorganic regulations that are here before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.044" offset="1584718">The appeal from the District Court was consolidated with the petitions for review in the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.384" offset="1606034">The two proceedings on alternate jurisdictional bases, the complaint in the District Court and the petitions for review in the Court of Appeals, are both before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.210" offset="1641352">Consequently, there is no jurisdiction or procedural issue which stands in the way of this Court’s resolving the statutory question and the related jurisdictional problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.061" offset="1688685">With the procedural complexity out of the way, I would like now to turn to the statutory issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.873" offset="1720032">In Du Pont II, the court below characterized the statute as, quote, “vague, uncertain and inconsistent” and described the court’s objective as somehow making EPA’s position workable; with the statute, the court was workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.457" offset="1790354">We suggest that if the court had focused more on the words of the statute and less on the quasi-legislative function of trying to make EPA’s position somehow workable with the statute, it would have found the statutory plan relatively straightforward and non-complex.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="439.062" offset="1856705">Well, do you suggest that workability is not a factor that a court takes into account when it examines a statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_c_barnard" startTime="447.682" stopTime="473.729">
            <label>Mr. Robert C. Barnard</label>
            <text syncTime="447.682" offset="1891187">I believe a court should consider workability obviously; but the court should look to the words of the statute, not to see whether it can accommodate something and make it workable in my suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.556" offset="1930684">And the words of the statute are not designed to make something workable; the words of the statute are the command which the court and EPA should follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.280" offset="1965583">And I will turn to the words of the statute, which I believe demonstrates that the court's practical considerations disregard the words of the statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="473.729" stopTime="484.326">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="473.729" offset="1995363">Would you carry that to the point where if pursuing that course would determine that the statute was unworkable?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_c_barnard" startTime="484.326" stopTime="636.147">
            <label>Mr. Robert C. Barnard</label>
            <text syncTime="484.326" offset="2037786">I suppose it could happen that the statute could be determined to be unworkable, I don't think that is the situation here at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.950" offset="2064326">Section 301, as I have said earlier, Subsection (a) forbids all discharges unless they are permitted under the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.849" offset="2099853">Subsection (b) lays the foundations for the regulations for all existing sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.223" offset="2121378">To carry out the objectives of the Act, the subsection says, there shall be achieved by 1977 effluent limitations requiring 1977-level technology and, by 1983, effluent limitations requiring 1983-level technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.188" offset="2189296">It is significant that Section 301 is written in the passive voice, "objectives to be achieved".</text>
            <text syncTime="529.767" offset="2219598">The only reference to regulations is the specific reference to regulations under Section 304(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="536.948" offset="2248333">The technological requirements are to be defined and determined, quote, “in accordance with regulations issued by the Administrator under Section 304(b)”.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.169" offset="2293159">304(b), to which 301 refers, contains the direct statutory command that within one year the Administrator shall publish regulations providing guidelines for effluent limitations; and Section 304(b) contains detailed instructions as to what is to go into the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.465" offset="2374347">It provides that the regulations shall do two things: first, Subsection 1a and 2a provide that the Administrator shall identify in specific terms the degree of reduction in pollution that can be achieved or is attainable by the application of 1977-level technology in one case and 1983 technology in the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.939" offset="2468284">This is to be accomplished for classes and categories of point sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.459" offset="2490331">Second, Subsections 1b and 2b direct how the regulations are to be applied to plants within the classes or categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.599" offset="2526903">The regulations shall specify the factors to be taken into account in determining control measures applicable to point sources within the classes or categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.746" offset="2575490">The statutory command is even more concrete, because it lists the factors which are to be specified in the regulations and to be taken into account in framing permits under Section 402.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.247" offset="2625436">EPA asserts that if permit officers are to apply the factors --</text>

            <text syncTime="636.147" offset="2645081">Mr. Barnard, the statute does not specifically refer to Section 402, what you just quoted, does it?</text>

            <text syncTime="642.530" offset="2670576">No, it does not.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="643.464" stopTime="645.068">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="643.464" offset="2674338">It just talks about effluent limitations.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_c_barnard" startTime="645.068" stopTime="1327.351">
            <label>Mr. Robert C. Barnard</label>
            <text syncTime="645.068" offset="2680816">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.232" offset="2685414">Section 402(d) refers to guidelines, but there is not a specific cross-reference, yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.880" offset="2720000">EPA says that if the permit officers are to apply the factors, this will lead to wholesale reconsideration of the factors in the permit process.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.811" offset="2755735">We believe EPA's assertion confuses the role as to the factors and EPA’s role and the permit officers' role.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.934" offset="2780186">Obviously, EPA must consider the factors in specifying them in the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.232" offset="2801397">The permit officer uses EPA’s explication of the factors as the basis for applying, not reconsidering, the factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.291" offset="2833685">The Congressional intent that these factors to be specified by EPA would be used by a permit officer in the permit process is indicated by the fact, which the court below noted, that a number of the factors such as age of the plant are really relevant or applicable only to a particular plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.312" offset="2913724">One of the clearest confirmations of the Congressional intent that this was the pattern to be followed is found in the conference report.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.559" offset="2942772">The paragraph quoted in Page 55 of our brief and discussed at length in all of the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.760" offset="2963565">The report referring to Section 304(b) records the Congressional intent that the limitations within a category are to be precise in order that the limitations will be as uniform as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.284" offset="3033678">EPA focused sharply on the word "uniform" and disregards the explanation in the report that uniformity does not mean identity.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.385" offset="3077982">To the contrary, the report explains what Congress meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.341" offset="3097835">Similar point sources, Congress said, with similar characteristics would be subject to similar limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="756.610" offset="3126883">It is precisely this similar treatment which Section 304(b) is designed to accomplish.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.338" offset="3157812">When the factors are specified in the regulations, an officer will be able to select in the permit process limitations for plants which have similar characteristics with the result that they will be treated similarly.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.054" offset="3216744">This is true uniformity.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.604" offset="3230955">Section 301 of the Act says the objectives to be achieved are effluent limitations requiring 1977- or '83-level technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.794" offset="3271706">The definition of "effluent limitations" is instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.264" offset="3285498">Section 502-11 says that "effluent limitations" means "a restriction on discharges from point sources established by a State or EPA, including schedules of compliance".</text>
            <text syncTime="809.941" offset="3340251">A State clearly cannot establish effluent limitations except in a permit, and a schedule of compliance obviously relates to an individual permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.159" offset="3377136">Indeed, it was EPA’s effort to change the definition in the regulations, Subsection 11(i) of the general provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.175" offset="3413185">By deleting the references to restrictions established by a State and by deleting a reference to the schedules of compliance, which led the court below to set EPA’s definition aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.417" offset="3466161">The regulations before the Court are entitled, quote, “effluent limitations guidelines for the inorganic chemical-manufacturing industry".</text>
            <text syncTime="850.741" offset="3503464">The term "effluent limitations guidelines" is not a statutory term; but it is defined in EPA’s general regulations, Subsection (j).</text>
            <text syncTime="859.887" offset="3540036">Subsection (j) provides, quote, “The term 'effluent limitations guidelines' means any effluent limitations guidelines issued by the Administrator pursuant to Section 304(b) of the Act".</text>
            <text syncTime="872.213" offset="3589355">EPA’s brief does not refer to this definition, nor to the fact that the general provisions nowhere speak of regulations under Section 301 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.258" offset="3633554">The definition in the general provisions is, in fact, a confirmation of the announcement that EPA made in 1983 in what it called a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and it referred there to effluent limitations guidelines, standards of performance pursuant to 304(b) of the Act and 306 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.873" offset="3715996">The announced purpose of the notice was to facilitate comment on rules to be published under Section 304(b) and Section 306; no reference to regulations under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.191" offset="3777227">When the proposed inorganic regulations were published in October 1973, the preamble expressly stated with respect to existing plans, quote, “The regulations propose herein set forth effluent limitations guidelines pursuant to Section 304(b) of the Act”; again, not a word about 301 regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.399" offset="3870119">When the final inorganic regulations were published in March 1974, the preamble referred back to the proposed regulations for the statement of the legal bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.285" offset="3913587">EPA now asserts that in both the proposed and the final regulations, it gave notice that the regulations were issued under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.190" offset="3949218">Section 301 was paraphrased in both the notice in 1973 and in the preamble to the proposed regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.192" offset="3981296">The preamble to the final regulations contains the statement that the regulations were issued pursuant to Sections 301, 304, 306 and 307.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.372" offset="4021943">But at the same time, it refers back to the proposed regulations for the statement of legal bases for the regulations, which was Section 304(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="989.903" offset="4060081">The final regulations also incorporate the general provisions, which define effluent limitations guidelines to be 304(b) regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.777" offset="4095608">The assertions in EPA’s brief that 301 was cited as the authority, I think will not withstand examination of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.631" offset="4127059">At most, it is an acknowledgment by EPA that 301 and 304 are related, because 301 directs that regulations shall be issued under 304, and 304 directs that effluent guideline limitations shall be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1023.728" offset="4195396">We suggest that the specific words "effluent limitations guidelines" as they are defined in the general provisions and the words in the preamble to both the proposed and final inorganic regulations confirm EPA’s contemporaneous interpretation at this Act that its job was to issue regulations in conformity with Section 304(b)'s commands and that that is what it said it intended to issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.244" offset="4309498">EPA has now virtually abandoned its February 1974 contention that the regulations are issued under both 301 and 304.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.648" offset="4347115">EPA now says that regulations should be issued under Section 304(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="1075.699" offset="4403330">It now asserts that it has complied with the substance of Section 304(b) by issuing a voluminous development document and economic report, and I would like to talk about that in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.127" offset="4448992">EPA now argues that it has authority to issue single-number limitations by regulations to be cranked into a permit by rote and that this authority is derived by implication from Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.161" offset="4509178">It asserts an administrative convenience as the basis for this decision and a fear of laxity by the States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.619" offset="4542929">We suggest that EPA is wrong both on policy and on legal grounds in this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.009" offset="4564558">On policy grounds, Congress specifically decided that the major responsibility for controlling pollution within a State shall fall upon the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.882" offset="4611996">This policy is confirmed expressly in Section 101 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.123" offset="4629028">Section 402, which sets up the permit system, provides for transfer of the administration of the permits to the States as soon as they satisfy certain conditions of the statute, and 26 States I believe have now satisfied those conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.878" offset="4687961">EPA’s decision to issue single-number limitations because of some fear of State laxity reduces the States to the role of a scrivener.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.062" offset="4736757">Whatever EPA’s fears amount to, and we submit that they are baseless because of the statutory provisions for review, this reduction of the role of the State is in contravention of Congress's intention that the State shall have a major role in control and administration of pollution regulations within their States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.530" offset="4814602">To understand how EPA's power-by-implication position does violence to the statute, it is necessary to go back a little bit and look at the statutory plan again.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.273" offset="4861623">Section 304, as I said, mandates that EPA shall issue regulations for effluent guidelines, which shall identify by categories the degree of reduction attainable by application of 1977 or 1983 technology and shall specify the factors applicable in determining control measures for particular point sources within the classes and categories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.777" offset="4959634">The statute lists the factors to be specified; these include age of facilities, process employed, engineering aspects of the application of the control technology, non-water-quality considerations, specifically energy requirements, and cost benefit for 1977 and process changes for 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.367" offset="5045943">The legislative history of the Act, and particularly the Senate report, made clear that what Congress was thinking about was the enormous variety of existing plants and that they wanted guideline regulations that would contain ranges of numbers for each category and a specification to guide the permit authorities in selecting the appropriate number in the range.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.980" offset="5132460">In our brief, we have used the word "flexibility" in describing regulations which comply with the command of Section 304(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.791" offset="5167673">"Flexibility" in this context means only that the permit will be tailored to the particular situation of that particular plant in light of the factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.860" offset="5207902">It does not mean that either the regulations or the permit officer can deviate from the technological requirement in Section 301, application of best practical control technology for 1977 and best available for 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.503" offset="5282507">"Flexibility" means that the permit officer will be guided by the regulations in selecting the control technology or control measures for a particular plant which meets the respective 1977 and 1983 requirement rather than force-fit a single-number limitation on a plant regardless of its special circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.921" offset="5368189">This we think is exactly what the Congress meant when it said in the conference report similar plants with similar characteristics shall be subject to similar limitations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1362.177" offset="5549165">Number 1, so far as approving is concerned, that word stems from the fact that the statute that as originally passed required EPA to approve each State-issued permit before it became valid.</text>

            <text syncTime="1385.521" offset="5642579">The limitations language in there clearly refers in our view to Section 301(c), which authorizes the Administrator to deviate from the requirements of 1983 upon a specific point as set forth in Section 301(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="1402.166" offset="5709139">In order to have that reviewed, the language had to be in the statute dealing with limitations under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.332" offset="5737769">EPA assigns no meaning to the word "approving" as it appears in that section, and indeed if EPA’s construction is correct it refers to limitations under Section 306, then the limitations words in Subsection (f) are actually a duplication or render Subsection (a), which deals with new-source matters, without purpose or without effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.405" offset="5846125">It seems to us clear that that provides no authority for the kind of general limitations that EPA has issued which override the commands the Section 304(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.639" offset="6583092">But the section speaks of requirements; it is does not speak of limitations to be issued under the Section 301.</text>

            <text syncTime="1657.667" offset="6731154">Without that authority, he could not have provided a deviation based on the findings that the statute speaks of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.540" offset="6758635">Section 301(d), which EPA does not mention in its brief, like Section 301(c), also contains a specific cross-reference to the procedure standard to be explicated by regulations under Section 304(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.602" offset="6822896">Section 301(d) provides for review every five years of any limitation required under Paragraph (b)(2); that is the 1983 step.</text>

            <text syncTime="1718.567" offset="6974720">The permits normally lasts five years; they need to be renewed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1745.590" offset="7082867">In short, the most up-to-date regulations will be applicable to those permits as they are reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.619" offset="7119020">EPA now acknowledges that there should be regulations under Section 304(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1760.244" offset="7141485">It asserts that the lengthy development document and economic report comply in substance with the mandate of Section 304(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.335" offset="7181818">There are two basic objections to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.698" offset="7195298">304(b) directs that regulations providing guidelines for effluent limitations shall be issued, not discursive documents that have no legal effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.118" offset="7244930">Secondly, these documents perform none of the functions of guideline regulations, because they provide no guidance to permit officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.550" offset="7274710">EPA says it has issued limitations which must be cranked into the permit, there is no guidance to the officer except to crank them into the permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.929" offset="7312222">EPA makes four additional, and I suggest non-consistent, arguments on the matter of the form and content of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.604" offset="7354958">In the preamble, EPA says that Section 304(b) provides for guidelines to implement the standards of Section 301, all by itself an interesting term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.154" offset="7417129">Congress thus recognized, EPA says, that “some flexibility” was necessary to take into account the complexity of the industrial world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.635" offset="7463001">To achieve that flexibility, EPA put into the regulations for each subcategory a standard clause authorizing the Administrator to grant a modification of the single-number limitation upon a showing that the factors applicable to a particular plant are fundamentally different from those considered by the Administrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.318" offset="7553802">This provision, EPA says, provides the flexibility which the statute contemplated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.421" offset="7578148">Three Courts have disagreed: the court below, the Third Circuit and the District Court in the grant-processing case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.521" offset="7618586">The Second Circuit held that without some variance provision, the scheme of limitations could well founder on the rock of illegality; but it postponed the decision as to the validity of the particular variance clause to the facts of a particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.208" offset="7685355">We suggest that this narrow variance clause should not be debated for the reason that it is surplusage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.552" offset="7718687">Moreover, in August 1974, EPA announced that it was rethinking the variance clause and asked for public comment on the variance clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.081" offset="7756826">EPA has not revealed the result of that re-examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.611" offset="7778978">EPA is correct in our view that the Congress did intend some flexibility; indeed it went further: it specifically provided for the flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.402" offset="7818057">If EPA had complied with Section 304(b) by specifying the factors to be taken into account in determining the limitations of the permit, there would be no need to device a narrow variance clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.666" offset="7871138">The stature itself determines specific terms, the flexibility which Congress said was permissible in that Section 304(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.213" offset="7909381">Secondly, EPA said it considered the factors in setting up the subcategories in these regulations and that the factors justified no further sub-categorization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.393" offset="7950027">The issue is not further sub-categorization, but whether EPA can ride roughshod over the command in Section 304(b) that it specify the factors to be taken into account in determining the control measures for plants within a category or class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.434" offset="8018259">Third, EPA says that its regulations provided ranges, because different limitations have been fixed for different subcategories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.634" offset="8055040">But the fact that there are different numbers for different categories does not create a range as Congress contemplated, as the Third Circuit correctly pointed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.841" offset="8095895">A range made up of different numbers in different subcategories is no guidance to a permit officer in determining control measures for a plant within a single category.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.090" offset="8140826">A limitation applicable to a plant manufacturing sodium silicate in the sodium-silicate subcategory is not relevant in any way in determining the limitation for a plant manufacturing titanium dioxide in the titanium-dioxide subcategory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.807" offset="8215745">Fourth, EPA also takes the position that there is an implicit range in each subcategory from the specific limitation number down to zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.448" offset="8250331">But this range is, as the Third Circuit again we think correctly held, is an illusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.165" offset="8281156">No factors are specified to enable a permit officer to select the number within this, "range".</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.911" offset="8312189">More basically, the record does not provide any support for a number down to zero when the number EPA selected based on the record is a number above zero.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.512" offset="8362553">Finally, EPA says that there is great administrative convenience in having single-number limitations, it is easier to administer, and it refers to the use of the word "uniform" in the conference report.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.402" offset="8418142">Whatever the administrative convenience is concerned, it cannot override the commands of Section 304, as explained in the conference report that similar plants with similar characteristics shall be subject to similar limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.446" offset="8478328">This emphasis by Congress on the similarity of treatment is easily understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.685" offset="8499226">When Congress was developing the 1972 Act, EPA was well along in developing the so-called permit program under the Refuse Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.205" offset="8537365">Congress was well-aware of the fact that EPA had prepared what are called guidance documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.719" offset="8559412">These guidance documents recognize the range of plants in the industry and establish ranges of parameters by subcategories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.638" offset="8599014">Some of the guidance documents actually refer to the factors; others, the inorganic's guidance document, says that EPA will provide a technical briefing so that the permit officers will understand how the factors are to be applied in the course of issuing permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.883" offset="8667977">And it is this same regulatory pattern which we believe the Congress had in its mind when it adopted Section 304(b) providing for guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.195" offset="8709250">Indeed, the regulatory pattern continued after the Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.294" offset="8729626">To assist the permit officers in the interval before new regulations were issued, EPA in May 1973 directed that the guidance documents would be used by the officers in permits, “until effluent guidelines are promulgated under Section 304”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.841" offset="8815830">This reference to effluent guidelines under 304 and the character of the guidance documents themselves are further confirmation of the contemporaneous construction EPA gave to this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.378" offset="8869956">Now, this pattern was abruptly changed in February 1974, when Assistant Administrator Kirk's memorandum was made public, the memorandum that announced the new theory that the regulations would provide limitations in reliance on implied authority under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.052" offset="8948741">This about-face by the Administration in the midst of the regulatory process demonstrates that there has been no consistent administrative interpretation to which this Court should defer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.660" offset="8995134">To the contrary, such about-face means, we suggest, the current administrative position provides very little guidance to what the statute means and how it should be interpreted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.441" offset="9046230">There are other provisions in the Act which confirm that EPA’s current position is wrong and that Congress intended the regulatory structure to be based on guidelines under Section 304(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.039" offset="9092623">Section 515 of the Act creates a distinguished scientific review committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.086" offset="9116865">EPA was directed to send proposed regulations to this committee for review in advance of publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.968" offset="9140375">Section 515 refers specifically to regulations under Section 304(b); it does not refer to regulations under Section 301.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.895" offset="9180081">It is difficult to believe that if Congress had intended regulations to be issued under Section 301 which override the provisions of Section 304(b), it would not have provided for their review by the advisory committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.422" offset="9238178">All of the other measure regulations -- pretreatment standards, new-source standards -- are mentioned along with Section 304(b); but there is no reference to Section 301 regulations in Section 515.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.261" offset="9285512">EPA not only fails to mention 515 in its brief, but also fails to discuss the advisory committee’s review of inorganic regulations, characterizing them as, “unscientific”.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.034" offset="9340578">The committee said, among other things, the regulations fail to take into consideration great differences in individual facilities; also that the EPA disregarded the instructions in Section 304 as to the cost of application of practicable and available technology, especially for small plants in the industry.</text>

            <text syncTime="2386.439" offset="9646210">EPA, the Court held, can combine regulations under Section 301 and 304 and issue limitations by regulation, the Court said; but the Court was not willing, as EPA would like, to read Section 304 out of Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.658" offset="9719144">The limitations, the court concluded, are presumptively applicable; that is, the regulations are to be applicable unless the presumption is rebutted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.142" offset="9761045">The reference, the Court said, to Section 304(b) in Section 301 means that the Congress intended that the factors set out in Section 304(b) were to be applied by the permit officer in determining whether the presumptively valid regulations shall be applied to a particular plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.087" offset="9840875">The court stopped short of requiring, as the Third Circuit did, that the factors be set out in the regulations, and we believe this is what Section 304(b) commands.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.621" offset="9882984">The compromise by the court below on what it called practical grounds moves a long way from EPA’s rigid interpretation of limitations to be cranked in by rote to permits, but it falls short of compliance with Section 304(b), and in our view EPA should be directed to comply with Section 304(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.505" offset="9978488">This brings me to the jurisdictional issue, which has already been discussed, at least in response to questions from Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.303" offset="10013701">EPA places great emphasis on Subsection (e), which Justice Stevens referred to that refers to review of the Administrator's action in approving or promulgating effluent limitation under Sections 301, 302 or 306.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.925" offset="10080156">I have indicated that I think the approving language was in there to provide for review in Federal courts of action by the Administrator in reviewing State-issued permits, and the promulgating language was there to deal with the situation of Section 301(c), where the Administrator is authorized to grant deviations from the 1983 requirement on a specific finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2520.316" offset="10181721">We believe it is clear that under the normal course, the regulations under 304(b) would be reviewable in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.021" offset="10228532">The statute contemplates that they be issued at different times than the new-source standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.298" offset="10253714">There is no question that the review of new-source standards is in the Court of Appeals' Section; Subsection (a) of 509 (b)(1) specifically so provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.147" offset="10301048">However, we believe that is an appropriate case for this Court to conclude the Court of Appeals had pendent jurisdiction to review the guideline regulations at the same time as it reviewed the new-source standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.441" offset="10350263">As it turned out, they were issued on same record at the same time, and the issues that arise, the technical issues, are substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2572.175" offset="10389237">It is therefore in our view an appropriate case for this Court to conclude that court below has pendent jurisdiction -- this is different from exclusive jurisdiction -- and would not invoke the 90-day clause as a penalty on those who in reliance on the statute did not file within the 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.549" offset="10462694">I now turn to the cross-petition in 1705, in which the Government seeks review of the holding by the court below that EPA should insert in the new-source standards what the court called an escape valve, which would enable permit officers to make adjustments in the requirements of the single-number standards to take into account the special circumstances of a particular new plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2929.336" offset="11817822">There is no doubt and I agree completely with the Eighth Circuit that these regulations should have clout and they do have clout.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.752" offset="11839451">EPA can review; it not only controls its own permit officers, but it can review State-issued permits to be sure they are within the guidelines, as the statute contemplates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.807" offset="11899742">To return to the escape valve, Section 402(k) of the Act, we believe, contemplates that such adjustments will be made, because it says that compliance with the permit shall be compliance with the requirements of Section 306.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.095" offset="11960868">The logic of that subsection is that escape-valve adjustments were in contemplation by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.442" offset="11990230">But even if Section 402(k) were not in the law, the cases established the principle that an Agency may establish general principles for general standards, but it has an obligation to look to the facts in a particular case in light of the statutory standard and objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.342" offset="12061910">This is really almost an element of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.800" offset="12075703">General provisions can be fatally arbitrary without some kind of, “escape valve”.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.719" offset="12107363">The Water Act did not leave this to interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.837" offset="12123872">It specifically provided in Section 402(k) for such an escape valve.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.088" offset="12156891">These cases present a rather unusual situation for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.631" offset="12179043">It is unusual that an issue of statutory construction is being presented to this Court at a time when EPA has just launched a major review, looking to re-issuance of 1983-step regulations and new-source standards, pretreatment standards, for 21 major industry categories, including inorganic chemicals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.309" offset="12281756">The 1977-step permit process is virtually finished, permits were issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.774" offset="12307565">The question now turns on the renewal under the 1983-step regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.877" offset="12332016">As the Court’s decision will come at a time when the regulations are in their inception rather than at the conclusion of an ongoing process that is now underway for review and re-issuance of all of these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.230" offset="12413414">EPA’s review was undertaken pursuant to an agreement signed in June of this year with the Natural Resources Defense Council and others to settle four lawsuits filed in the District Court against EPA.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.571" offset="12466808">The Federal Register for November 24th, 1976 contains a reference to this review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.318" offset="12501812">It contains an invitation for the public to participate in what EPA calls the development of major EPA environmental regulations and lists on several pages the regulations under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.473" offset="12566387">On Page 51865, it lists the 24 industry categories under the following heading: Proposed effluent guidelines are now being revised for review of best available technology -- that is 1983 -- in the following source categories; then it lists the 21.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.656" offset="12643082">It is perhaps a little more than interesting that out of the litigation context, they call them guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.469" offset="12670354">This same notice refers to the review that I mentioned earlier undertaken in August 1974 of the variance clause, and it says: Proposed variance regulations: regulations establishing procedures for obtaining variances from best practical-treatment requirements and adopted effluent guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.134" offset="12749035">Again, it is interesting that they call them guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.847" offset="12767843">We suggest that the Court should reverse the decision below and direct EPA to follow the requirements of Section 304.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.708" offset="12811311">We suggest also that this is an appropriate case for the Court to conclude that the court below had pendent jurisdiction to review the regulations, since they were issued on the same record at the same time as the new-source standards which were before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3193.029" offset="12872646">We think it is appropriate in this case because of the special circumstances of the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3242.061" offset="13068774">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.760" offset="13083507">As this Court pointed out last term in the California case, in the 1972 amendments, Congress made a rather sharp change in the methods for dealing with the serious problems this country faces in connection with water pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.213" offset="13149335">Previously, the method for dealing with this had been focused on achieving certain qualities of the water, that is, looking to the end product, the water, and trying to reduce the level of pollutants in it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.171" offset="13197192">In 1972 amendments, Congress shifted from that primary emphasis to an emphasis on achieving strict effluent limitations, restrictions on the amount of pollution discharged into the water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.136" offset="13257064">It further imposed very strict time schedules: 1977 for the first level, 1983 for the second level, with the hope, the ultimate objective set forth in the declaration of goals, that by 1985 pollution of this country’s water would be terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.185" offset="13341283">Now, the legislative history of these amendments shows a clear Congressional intent that this required the establishment of uniform effluent limitations on a national basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.293" offset="13405649">The theory that petitioners urge before this Court that all the Administrator is to do is to promulgate general guidelines which will specify ranges of permissible pollution that will detail particular factors that the issuance of permits are to consider in issuing permits, we think would seriously jeopardize and fraud the entire Congressional plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.756" offset="13519543">Instead of there being uniform effluent limitations on a national basis, what you would have would be the establishment of effluent limitations in each of approximately 40,000 to 50,000 proceedings looking to the issuance of particular permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.588" offset="13590805">As I will explain later, we do not suggest that these effluent limitations of the Administrator are to be mechanically cranked into the permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.043" offset="13636676">The permit issuers are not to be mere scriveners, as petitioners described, and I will explain the States will have a very major role in issuing permits under the Administrator’s theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3394.915" offset="13680143">But if the petitioners are correct, if that is all the Administrator can do, it seems to us it will fraud the basic Congressional objectives of achieving these pollution limitations and hopefully termination of pollution by the stated dates, which can only be achieved through uniform national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.191" offset="13761227">It is going to be very difficult, almost impossible, to have uniform national standards if each of the dozens of permit issuers has a wide variety in passing on the application of these rather generalized guidelines to particular permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.786" offset="13823608">We think the Administrator’s interpretation that he does have authority under Section 301 to promulgate binding effluent limitations, an interpretation which I point out has been adopted by six of the seven Courts of Appeals that have considered the problem, does effectuate the Congressional purpose to achieve these effluent limitations speedily.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.002" offset="13924545">We think this is precisely what Congress intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.031" offset="13936666">We shall argue that this is confirmed by the language of the statute, by the scheme of the statute and by the legislative history, and it represents the administrative interpretation of the statute by, in the language in Udall v. Tolman of the officials charged with setting the machinery in motion, of making the parts work effectively and smoothly while they are yet untried and new, and that kind of an interpretation is one to which the courts traditionally give great deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.892" offset="14064039">In last term in the California case, the court recognized the appropriateness of such deference in interpreting this highly complex and technical statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.500" offset="14106462">And I will shortly in my argument come and answer the contention that the Administrator’s interpretation first appeared shortly before the regulations were issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3513.473" offset="14154423">It is our submission that he has taken this position that he is going to act under both 301 and 304 from the outset of the effectiveness of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.498" offset="14194442">Now, we have set out in our brief a number of the statutory provisions which we think show that Congress intended the Administrator to have this authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.266" offset="14237596">Many of them are very technical and not particularly suitable for oral presentation, they involve cross-references back and forth; but there are three or four that I'd like to refer to, which we think clearly recognize the authority of the Administrator to promulgate these binding effluent limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.316" offset="14309799">The source for this is the Administrator’s general authority under Section 501(a) to prescribe such regulations as are necessary to carry out the Administrator's functions under this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3566.824" offset="14367791">Now, the first provision to which we refer is Section 301(e), and we have filed with the Court the paper edition of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.762" offset="14419513">It is unfortunately terribly long and terribly complicated, but I will refer to the particular pages of this pocket pamphlet in dealing with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.631" offset="14459010">This is at Page 30 of statute, Section 301(e).</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.908" offset="14492134">Now, what it states is, effluent limitations established pursuant to this section or Section 302, which deals with water-quality control, shall be applied to all point sources of discharge of pollutants in accordance with the provisions of this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.928" offset="14560156">Now, it speaks of effluent limitations established pursuant to this section, but the permits are not issued pursuant to this section; the permits are issued pursuant to Section 402, and it seems to us this recognizes that something other than an effluent limitation --</text>

            <text syncTime="3644.006" offset="14676558">This, it seems to us, indicates that what is being spoken about here in effluent limitations established pursuant to this section is something other than effluent limitations established in permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.173" offset="14729221">The same thing is true, we think, with respect to Subsection (c), which is two paragraphs above Subsection (e), which authorizes the Administrator to modify the requirements of Subsection (b), which deals with the effluent limitations, in the case of any application for a permit filed after July 1, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.947" offset="14820232">Well, if the only way that the effluent limitations are to be established is through the permits, there was obviously no need to give the Administrator the authority to waive any limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.720" offset="14871327">This again, it seems to us, clearly contemplates that there will be established effluent limitations separate and apart from the permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.826" offset="14911765">Now, Mr. Barnard has suggested in dealing with the provision in Section 501(b)(1), which is set out at Page 77 of the statute, that when the statute says there may be review had of the action of the Administrator (e) in approving or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation under Section 301, 302, etcetera, all that refers to is his action in granting an exemption under 301(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="3735.749" offset="15043526">Well, first of all, it seems to us the language is much broader than that, and there is nothing in anything of the history of this suggesting such a limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.006" offset="15076545">But that argument ignores the very next subsection of this paragraph, which also provides for review of the Administrator’s action in issuing or denying any permit under Section 402, and it seems to us that if the only way that effluent limitations were to be established was through permits, there would be no need for these two paragraphs, because if they are only to be established through permits, if the Administrator approves a modification or variance from an effluent limitation or particular permit, that would be reviewable, we think, under Section 402.</text>
            <text syncTime="3781.173" offset="15225234">Now, there is one other provision which Mr. Barnard has not referred to, which is Section 505 at Page 73 of the statute and it goes over to 74.</text>
            <text syncTime="3794.039" offset="15276643">That provision permits citizen suits against any person alleged to be in violation of an effluent standard or limitation under this Act and under that provision, there is a separate section.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.111" offset="15336934">Subsection (f) on Page 74, which defines for purposes of citizen suits what these terms mean; and it defines effluent limitation to include, under Subparagraph 2, an effluent limitation or other limitation under Section 301 or 302, and then under Subsection 6, a permit or condition thereof issued under Section 402.</text>
            <text syncTime="3836.425" offset="15446230">So once again, a clear recognition that there are two different animals we are talking about: one is an effluent limitation established under 301 or 302, the other is a permit which by definition also will contain an effluent limitation, since it specifies the precise limits of discharge.</text>

            <text syncTime="4002.349" offset="16109845">Let me, if I may, give a specific example of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="4007.203" offset="16129280">For example, in the chlorine subcategory, there are specific limitations; you can discharge a certain amount of a particular pollutant for each thousand pounds that you produce.</text>

            <text syncTime="4028.782" offset="16215588">The job of the permit issuer and the reason for the permit is to specify exactly how much this particular plant can discharge, and that is something more than just a mechanical job.</text>
            <text syncTime="4042.734" offset="16271386">It is not just cranking them in.</text>
            <text syncTime="4044.470" offset="16278387">It requires a number of calculations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4046.844" offset="16287895">For example, frequently it is unclear precisely which subcategory a plant fits into.</text>
            <text syncTime="4054.378" offset="16317988">A plant may have very complicated processes, and it is necessary for the permit issuer to study the thing and find out where it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.747" offset="16355500">Sometimes, for example, you may have a situation where one of the standards depends upon the process employed at the plant.</text>

            <text syncTime="4079.708" offset="16419343">Just as important is, the permit is the place where the schedules of compliance are set forth; that is, a permit not only tells them how much they can discharge, but sets forth specific dates by which they are to achieve and be along the way to accomplishing the limitations of 1977 and 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="4102.975" offset="16512444">That is, it will say by such-and-such a date in 1979, you have to have completed this step.</text>

            <text syncTime="4140.593" offset="16662909">They don't come out of thin air, because the Administrator himself has promulgated a set of rather detailed guidelines that have to be followed by every State that is authorized to have its own permit programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4156.062" offset="16724767">So a number of these things, such as the monitoring and the reporting requirements, are set forth in his own guidelines for the permit program.</text>
            <text syncTime="4164.946" offset="16760294">In addition, some of them do come out of the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4168.643" offset="16775027">For example, in the hypothetical case I suggested to you in which the question is which particular process is employed and therefore into which subcategory the plant fits, one way for determining that would be to look at these lengthy guidelines, this huge, thick document which is filled with a mass of technical detail, and see on the basis of that what were the factors that led the Administrator to conclude that there was this category and there was that category, and on the basis of those factors, the permit issuer would seek to fit it into the category that the permit issuer thinks most closely approximates that guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4209.533" offset="16938658">I want to stress again, because of what Mr. Barnard has said, that the States have a major role to play in the administration of this permit program.</text>
            <text syncTime="4222.188" offset="16989231">They are not just sitting there and saying, okay, here is this permit; let's add it up and put it in the computer and comes out with numbers and write it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="4229.511" offset="17018488">It is a very complicated process to issue these permits to decide precisely what the limitations are, to set the schedules of compliance, to determine exactly what can be done and to determine, among other things, whether the plan that this particular company has proposed, the treatment processes it intends to use, will satisfy the requirements of the guidelines and of the standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="4259.063" offset="17136770">Will this really hold out promise of accomplishing what the company is required to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="4265.269" offset="17161534">Now, a point has been made that Section 301 is written in the passive tense rather than in the active tense, and from that one should imply that no effluent limitations are required to be promulgated.</text>
            <text syncTime="4277.848" offset="17211898">I think it was employed in the passive tense, because that section is setting out the standards to be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="4286.587" offset="17246798">It has formulated the effluent limitations that are to be achieved by certain dates, and it just seems as a matter of grammatical construction that is an effective way to put it; it was announcing the Congressional policy: these limitations are to be achieved by this date.</text>
            <text syncTime="4300.740" offset="17303432">But that does not indicate that Congress did not intend to give the Administrator the authority to take whatever steps he felt were necessary to accomplish that objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="4312.320" offset="17349825">Now, there is another thing about this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="4317.381" offset="17369992">There are number of provisions dealing with various types of enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="4321.646" offset="17387128">Permitting citizen suits, permitting the Administrator to go into the District Court, they all speak of enforcement of the various statutory provisions dealing with effluent limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="4333.581" offset="17434775">You enforce 301, 302, 307, 306 and 402.</text>
            <text syncTime="4342.152" offset="17469152">At no point is there any reference to enforcement of the guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="4348.823" offset="17495797">The guidelines under their own analysis are not enforceable, and it seems to us totally inconsistent with the whole statutory scheme to say that Congress intended to enable the enforcement of the limitations in all of these other sections; but when you came to the most vital thing of all, the large number of existing sources that were polluting, nothing could be done with respect to those particular sources unless and until the general guidelines had been made effective as to each source through a permit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4388.335" offset="17653786">Indeed, there's no question has been raised here and it is conceded that the Administrator may adopt binding effluent limitations for these other categories -- for new sources, for toxic pollutants, for water-quality standards -- and it just seems so unlikely that Congress would have intended to give him that authority, at the same time denying him the authority to promulgate the effective type of effluent limitations where it was most needed in dealing with the new sources.</text>

            <text syncTime="4435.316" offset="17841763">Let me explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="4438.977" offset="17856392">That Section 515 is set out at Page 79 of the statute, and all of that 515 requires is that the Administrator more than 180 days before publishing a proposed rule is to give the committee notice that he is proposing to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="4465.208" offset="17961299">He is not to submit to the committee the draft of the regulation; all it says is to give notice.</text>
            <text syncTime="4470.829" offset="17983765">In this case they did in fact, they went beyond that and gave the committee the draft of the regulation; but all the committee is supposed to do is to get notice and then within 120 days, that is, 90 days before the regulations are to be published, the committee is to report and give the Administrator its views on how to deal with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4492.005" offset="18068506">Now, the guidelines basically will set forth the technology, the methods of dealing with the problem, the impact of the various proposed methods of reducing effluent pollution upon the industry, and at that point it seems to us is the place where the expert advice of the committee comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="4515.652" offset="18163069">The committee gives the Administrator the benefits of its expert judgment on how best to deal with this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="4522.155" offset="18189087">Well, that is the point at which the expert advice is needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="4526.387" offset="18206014">Once that has been done, there would be no occasion for the Administrator once again to come back to the committee and say, okay, these are the guidelines we are proposing; now, we'd like to get your expert views on whether or not under these standards the effluent limitation for this particular thing should be 1 pound of pollution per thousand pounds or 1½ pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="4552.086" offset="18308832">It seems to us the critical thing and the reason for this is to give this expert committee the input at the time the Administrator was studying the problems posed by the technology, the chemical, the engineering technology, all of which is reflected in this vast document.</text>
            <text syncTime="4570.669" offset="18383125">This thing is just a mass of technicalities.</text>
            <text syncTime="4573.464" offset="18394305">I frankly read it, skimmed it is more accurate; I could not understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="4577.854" offset="18411859">But someone in the chemical industry, I'm sure, knows exactly what this means, and this is the type of material we think that Congress intended that the Administrator to have in which he should have the benefits of the views of the expert groups.</text>

            <text syncTime="5346.715" offset="21487307">So it's not just that at an early stage the Administrator indicated he was proposing to act under 301, but that he actually that early, a year after the Act was passed, proposed specific limitations and gave everybody in the industry the opportunity to comment on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="5367.649" offset="21571108">The record contains a number of objections by industry, including the chemical industry, to these proposals, including the complaint that they shouldn't specify precise numerical limitations; that it should be put in terms of range; that they should promulgate guidelines; and various factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="5386.552" offset="21646654">And we think that this does reflect a consistent administrative interpretation, that here is a case and a complicated statute where the Administrator was charged with setting the thing in motion, early on concluded that he should deal with this problem of Section 301 and 304.</text>
            <text syncTime="5409.571" offset="21738814">Under the statute, the Administrator was directed to promulgate the guidelines within one year.</text>
            <text syncTime="5416.449" offset="21766295">Now, this proved to be an impossible task.</text>
            <text syncTime="5419.603" offset="21778938">Just the sheer magnitude of it, the studies that had to be made of all of these industries, he could not do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5425.876" offset="21804016">And what he did rather than promulgate first guidelines and then effluent limitations was, he combined the two steps into a single proceeding, and at the end of this proceeding he issued virtually simultaneously the guidelines, the actual limitations for existing sources and for new sources, and this seemed to us a preeminently practical method of handling it.</text>
            <text syncTime="5452.045" offset="21908715">There has been no unfairness to the petitioners, they were on full notice early on what was going to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="5458.202" offset="21933270">There's no indication that if he had followed separate procedures, anything would have been different.</text>
            <text syncTime="5463.772" offset="21955631">They knew exactly what he was proposing to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="5467.454" offset="21970259">They had full opportunity to comment on it twice, because the Administrator here followed a rather unusual procedure: he first published a proposed notice of proposed rulemaking and let them comment on that, and after they had gotten comments on that then he put out a notice of proposed rulemaking, then he got comments on that, and finally he adopted the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="5490.331" offset="22061792">I mean, it is really giving them more procedural protection than they required.</text>
            <text syncTime="5498.588" offset="22094811">The argument is made that these regulations are defective because they do not provide ranges and they do not specify the various factors that the permit issuer is to take into account really in applying the ranges to the particular plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="5525.735" offset="22203481">That, of course, is just another way of arguing, I think, that the Administrator can't promulgate binding effluent limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5535.614" offset="22242978">I add that there is nothing in the statute that speaks about ranges at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="5541.280" offset="22265652">The two references in the committee report to ranges, we think that the ranges, to the extent they are acquired, are provided by the act of dividing the industries into subcategories on the basis of particular processes, particular plants, particular types of equipment used.</text>
            <text syncTime="5560.367" offset="22341929">And for example, Mr. Barnard was complaining that one of the factors to be taken into account is age, and he said that age of a plant cannot be put into the formulation of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="5573.389" offset="22394070">Well, in at least one industry, they have broken down on the basis of age; in the electric-power industry, one subcategory is new plants, and another subcategory is old plants, a recognition that there are different problems in controlling pollution in different types of plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="5591.616" offset="22467004">Now, the specification of factors, we think that that requires is that the Administrator’s guidelines specify the factors that are to be applied under the effluent limitations -- that is, on what basis is the Administrator going to set the precise numbers -- and that we think is precisely what he has done here.</text>

            <text syncTime="6070.883" offset="24383974">We have quoted in our brief a number of excerpts from the legislative history, which we think confirm that Congress intended to permit the Administrator to adopt these regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6085.296" offset="24441652">I am not going to go through them at any length.</text>
            <text syncTime="6088.232" offset="24453459">Let me just quote one or two.</text>
            <text syncTime="6091.646" offset="24467043">The conference report and the differences between the House and the Senate Bill, which we have quoted at Page 60 of our brief, said that the conferees intend that the Administrator or the State, as the case may be, will make the determination of the economic impact of an effluent limitation on the basis of classes and categories of point sources, as distinguished from a plant-by-plant determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="6115.990" offset="24564427">Clearly, we think, contemplating an effluent limitation to be established for a class or category of source.</text>
            <text syncTime="6123.941" offset="24596297">And then in the House Bill, quoted at the top of Page 63, the House Report says that all permits issued under this program shall be consistent with the specific requirements of the Bill, including effluent limitations or other limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="6142.143" offset="24669022">Once again, a clear reorganization that effluent limitations are something other than and separate from the provisions in the permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="6154.086" offset="24716878">Now, let me turn to the question presented in our cross-petition, which is the requirement of the Court of Appeals that for new sources, there has to be a variance procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="6173.913" offset="24796186">The statute in Section 306(b) directs the Administrator to establish by regulations federal standards of performance for new sources within each industrial category, and the standard of that is the best available demonstrated technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="6195.207" offset="24881345">And it said, including where practicable a standard permitting no discharge of pollutants; that is, Congress hoped that when you dealt with new sources as distinguishably from existent sources, the Administrator would be able to find that was sufficient available technology to permit no discharge at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6217.303" offset="24969743">It is illegal after these standards of performance have been promulgated for any new source to operate in violation of the standards.</text>

            <text syncTime="6236.613" offset="25046961">Oh, yes, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6238.080" offset="25052813">It is remanded to and the Administrator is directed at Pages 262 and 263 of the record to come forward with some limited escape mechanism for new sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="6251.228" offset="25105371">It is not just the general statement that there should be; it said there should be and, the Administrator, you are directed to provide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="6258.663" offset="25135151">It told the Administrator to work out some scheme whereby new sources can have an escape mechanism.</text>
            <text syncTime="6267.389" offset="25170050">If this decision stands on the remand, he has got to come with some variance procedure for new sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="6274.998" offset="25200457">Now, the Court of Appeals recognized, both under the statute 301(c) for the 1983 sources and under the Administrator’s regulations for the 1977 sources, there is a variance provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6293.594" offset="25274854">The Court recognized also that there was no comparable thing for new sources; but nevertheless, it concluded that a variance procedure should also be presumptively applicable -- I'm sorry, that the new-source standards, like the existing-source standards, would be presumptively applicable and that there should be some various variance provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="6314.662" offset="25359177">This rather significantly is something the Court of Appeals did on its own.</text>
            <text syncTime="6318.958" offset="25376313">The petitioners did not ask the Court of Appeals to do this; the Court did it itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="6323.891" offset="25396062">And we challenge that, because we do not think that Congress ever intended there to be a variance provision for new sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="6333.048" offset="25432633">We think the reason is, there is a basic difference between getting existing sources into compliance and new sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="6341.576" offset="25466801">When you deal with an existing source, turning and improving it, bringing it up to standards, can be a very complicated, time-consuming and expensive procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="6353.098" offset="25512881">There are all sorts of a host of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="6355.874" offset="25523957">The Administrator, when he dealt with the existing sources, promulgated the limitations on a basis of a particular subcategory, and inevitably in that process he could not take account of particular problems that were unique to a particular plant, and therefore it would be fundamentally unfair to require a particular plant with unique problems to observe the general effluent standards and limitations that are applied to all members of this sub-industrial category; and for that reason the Administrator concluded that there should be a variance.</text>
            <text syncTime="6394.377" offset="25677975">This is also reflected in the statutory provision for a variance on the 1983 sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="6401.103" offset="25704934">But when you are dealing with a new plant, it seems to us you have a very different situation facing you.</text>
            <text syncTime="6406.807" offset="25727712">To begin with, by definition, there is no requirement of a plant making any changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="6413.152" offset="25753103">Secondly, the new plant when it is being built has much greater freedom to adopt new technologies.</text>
            <text syncTime="6422.283" offset="25789675">It does not having to take its existing operation and change it; it is starting fresh, and it is not only more feasible and not only better able to do this, but usually likely to be a lot cheaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="6436.755" offset="25847562">The standard that Congress directed to be set for new standards, new sources, is the best available demonstrated control technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="6450.849" offset="25903882">There is no reason why if a plant is being constructed from scratch it can't comply with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="6458.052" offset="25932721">This is the best way to control pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="6462.636" offset="25951007">You've got a tremendous problem in getting existing sources to comply and to cut down on their discharges to accomplish the achievement of these objectives; but when you are dealing with a plant that has not been constructed with a new source, the best way to avoid any growth of pollution is to make sure that the new source complies with these strict standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="6489.245" offset="26057482">Indeed, the hope was in Congress that in the case of new sources the standard would be no discharge at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="6496.471" offset="26086426">And we think that what Congress contemplated in Section 306 was that for a new source, unless it could comply with these strict effluent limitations, it should not be built at all; that is, Congress adopted a different approach when it was dealing with correcting existing sources and permitting new sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="6518.908" offset="26176078">Now, 306, with its very explicit thing that no new source shall operate except in compliance with these standards is in sharp contrast with some other provisions of the statute, which do explicitly permit, but not require, the Administrator to grant waivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="6540.731" offset="26263432">Reference has already been made to Section 301(c) with the waiver of the permit requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="6548.783" offset="26295614">Section 316(a) permits the Administrator to waive the requirements of both Section 301 and 306 for a particular plant for a single aspect of pollution, so-called thermal pollution, the discharge of heat into the waters, if he finds that compliance with the thermal-pollution standard is unnecessary to protect wildlife.</text>
            <text syncTime="6573.788" offset="26395611">And finally, we refer to Section 313 of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="6578.882" offset="26415987">That is the provision requiring Federal facilities to comply with all of the standards, and that section permits the President to grant a one-year waiver from any of the requirements of State and Federal pollution standards if he determines that it is in the paramount interest of the United States for any Federal facility to have such a waiver except that he cannot even do that with respect to either new-source standards under 306 or toxic pollutants under 307, and it seems to us that if the Congress did not even permit the President to waive compliance with the new-source standards for Federal facilities when he was able to conclude it was in the paramount interest of the United States to do so, it certainly did not intend to permit the Administrator to do this in the case of new sources merely because they said they could not really comply or it would be very laborious and very difficult for them to comply with the existing standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="6647.185" offset="26689227">The legislative history confirms this interpretation, we think, in the committee report of the House, which we have cited at Page 15 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="6657.195" offset="26729247">The committee list is one of the two most significant factors in the attainment of clean water, and I quote, "The need to preclude the construction of new sources which use less than the best available control technology for the reduction or elimination of the discharge of pollutants", and the words "to preclude the construction of new sources with less than the best available control technology" is the precise standard written into Section 306 for new sources.</text>

            <text syncTime="6750.097" offset="27100917">Now, on the jurisdictional question, as I understand now, there is no disagreement between us and the petitioners that if the Administrator has the authority which we say he has and which he's consistently said he has under 301, they concede as they have to, first, that the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to review the effluent limitations and, second, they also apparently now agree that as an incident to review of the effluent limitations, the guidelines also may be reviewed, that there was some uncertainty at an earlier stage of litigation precisely what their argument is.</text>
            <text syncTime="6788.713" offset="27255353">Now as I understand, their argument is only that if it be held that the Administrator does not have authority under Section 301, then the guidelines standing alone are to be reviewed in the District Courts, and they take the further position that if the Administrator does not have the authority under Section 301, but if a suit has been brought in the Court of Appeals challenging the existing new-source standards, which by definition are reviewable only in the Court of Appeals, then the guidelines somehow can come in under pendant jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="6826.040" offset="27404669">It is a very involved question.</text>
            <text syncTime="6828.249" offset="27413446">We hope the Court does not have to face it, of course, if the Court agrees that they do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="6833.944" offset="27436225">If the Court should reject our submission on this, we would suggest to the Court along the lines of the Court of Appeals in this case that even if it were to hold that the Administrator has no authority under 301, nevertheless, the close relationship between the 301 standards and the 304 guidelines would make it appropriate that the Court of Appeals nonetheless should have jurisdiction to review the guidelines.</text>
