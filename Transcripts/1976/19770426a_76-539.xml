            <label>Mr. David C. Greer</label>
            <text syncTime="68.206" offset="373366">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.602" offset="390920">I am David Greer and I am here representing the Dayton Ohio Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.354" offset="417879">The paramount issue that we present involves the proper fashioning of an equitable remedy in a school desegregation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.463" offset="462391">The basic principle is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.868" offset="472004">The nature of the violation determines the scope of the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.023" offset="492589">Our concern is with the application of that principle to a case where the finder of the facts determined that only limited segregatory practices exist as opposed to a dual system either mandated or under the keys standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.906" offset="568135">Our contention is that a system wide racial balance remedy as was mandated here by the Sixth Circuit cannot be justified equitably or constitutionally by such factual findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.559" offset="646711">Most of the factual contentions that were raised by the plaintiffs in this action were resolved after an extended trial, some five years ago in favor or the Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.234" offset="709405">Three findings were determined by the finder of the facts that constitutes what it termed a cumulative violation of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.919" offset="756216">Those three findings were a condition of racial imbalance in the schools of the Dayton system, the rescission of resolutions that had been enacted by a lame duck school board, and the existence of optional zones between certain schools in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.568" offset="842734">The Trial Courts specifically found and in its opinion after the first remand in reviewing the keys decision, which came up while this case was in process, specifically found that at no time, did the defendant maintained a dual system of education and specifically found that this case does not involve actions taken on a school by school basis, but rather segregatory practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.872" offset="984004">The first finding that was made on this case, a condition of racial imbalance does not amount to a violation of the constitution of this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.107" offset="1040951">The finding with respect to rescission of resolutions I think it is clear under the ruling of the Sixth Circuit in the law in this area can only be considered a violation of a constitutional duty to the extent that a constitutional duty to act existed at the time the original resolutions were adapted.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.473" offset="1138336">Do I understand that you are saying, the finding that there was a lack of racial balance that is the schools if not each reflect the total composition of the community is an erroneous finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.582" offset="1206776">You are attacking that finding are you?</text>

            <text syncTime="277.986" offset="1212419">No, Your Honor, I do not mean to be understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.811" offset="1223704">There is no question it was conceded at the outset that there is racial imbalance in the schools in the Dayton system.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.453" offset="1258290">The issue is that the racial --</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="290.753" offset="1263514">You are attacking the conclusion that close from was from that finding, namely the constitutional violation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_c_greer" startTime="298.237" stopTime="605.963">
            <label>Mr. David C. Greer</label>
            <text syncTime="298.237" offset="1293399">And it is clear under the case law that it is not a constitutional violation unless that condition exists because of intentional segregatory acts of the school board and the finding in this case was simply that there was a condition of racial imbalance and that it was consistent with the disbursement of the population in the Dayton area.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.185" offset="1397261">In other words, the evidence referred to actual census tracks as to where the populations where located and that Trial Court specifically found that the racial imbalance that existed in the Dayton Schools reflected exactly what the residential racial imbalance in the community was.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.845" offset="1491825">I would also point out in this regard; the court’s findings and they were facts that were as indisputable as the racial imbalance in the schools that the boundaries of the various schools in this area had seen no modifications to amount to anything for a period of some 20 years before the suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.876" offset="1592030">And that as the population in the Dayton area moved so changed the percentages of black to white students in the various schools serving the residential areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.612" offset="1650963">What the point that I want to make with regard to the three findings in this case is that there is only one of those findings that is standing alone could be considered a violation of the equal protection clause of the constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.474" offset="1722434">The cracks or the keystone of the findings of fact in this case was the finding with respect to optional zones.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.549" offset="1758692">Small areas between two schools where a student living in the area would have an option of going to either of those two schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.329" offset="1797771">The findings of fact here were those optional areas and there were some 150 of them at one point in the history of the school were generally placed there because of the choice of walking one more block to school as opposed to going over railroad tracks or wolf creek or what have you.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.462" offset="1878332">The court did find and mentioned four out of all these optional zones that may have had, I think was the court’s phrase, some racial significance at the time of their creation.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.966" offset="1944370">The court found as a fact that the majority of these zones had no racial significance as the time of their creation and it further found that none of the elementary school optional zones had any racial significance of any kind at the time this lawsuit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.605" offset="2026917">That left three of the four optional zones mentioned by the court as having any racial significance at the time of the filing of this lawsuit and as set forth in our brief and I will not try to go through all the factual arguments here or the factual findings, it is clear that the effect of these three zones which were high school optional zones was limited and minimal.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.992" offset="2136422">The reason we are here before you this afternoon is that these factual findings have triggered off a system wide remedy in the Dayton School District by which each and every school in the system is required to reflect the system wide racial balance plus or minus 15%.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.734" offset="2223462">In the brief which we filed, we were confident enough of our position to state not only that the remedy here must be rewritten, but also that the only way that the plaintiffs would hope to avoid a rewriting of the remedy would be to rewrite the factual findings and I submit that is exactly what this court has been requested to do in the various briefs that had been filed in opposition to our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.916" offset="2340177">The plaintiff’s brief tacitly concedes our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.607" offset="2362956">It does not attempt to justify the system wide remedy on the basis of the facts that were found.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.158" offset="2389079">First it attempts to stretch the factual findings beyond their evidentiary content and second, the challenges, the failure of the Trial Court to adapt the plaintiff’s position on the other factual issue is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.701" offset="2447279">The Justice Department’s brief in a more straightforward manner explicitly and expressly concedes our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.948" offset="2488239">The brief says and I have to quote to you because if I have to quote somebody, I like to quote my adversary when I can.</text>

            <text syncTime="618.966" offset="2576324">Then we get down to the point of rewriting the facts Mr. Justice White, and I would proposed to the court four separate reasons why you should not succumb to the temptation if it is a temptation to adapt that kind of an argument establish a whole new brand of law in this area and in essence what I think these four reasons should satisfy you, I hope is that you should accept the facts as found by the trier of the facts and adjust the remedy rather than accepting the remedy and adjusting the findings of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.378" offset="2730029">First, I would submit that the facts in this case, including the fact of a non-dual system and either the statutory or the key sense of the term have been determined as the law provides they should be determined and no appeal was taken by the plaintiffs from the Trial Court’s findings as to a non-dual system.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.656" offset="2819159">Secondly, I would point out that there was not finding of intentionally segregative school board actions in a significant or meaningful portion of the school system and that there was therefore no basis for shifting the school authorities the burden of proving that racially imbalance schools within the system were not the result of intentionally segregative actions.</text>

            <text syncTime="713.568" offset="2954786">That is the question of was it in a meaningful or significant section of the school then there would be a shift of burden and I think my response to that would be clear and that is really my third plight here, and that is that even if the burden were shifted, the school board did not sit silent through this three or four weeks of hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.284" offset="3033676">We did present evidence on each of these issues that was presented and the facts in the record, support a finding that even if the keys presumption had been called into effect of the presumption is after all a rebuttable presumption and the Trial Court found that the arguments that were made should be rejected and that the racial imbalance in the schools in the system was not the result of intentional segregatory actions by the school board.</text>

            <text syncTime="777.391" offset="3210055">As I understand, the Justice Department’s position which I must confess I received in the fifth day of a trial that I am presently engaged in, in Cincinnati, after completely agreeing with all my position in this case, they would ask this court to look to the record making all new finding of fact, which is contrary to the findings of fact that has been made, taking historical practices that exist or historical situations that happened in 1926 or in 1933 and then by some leap of logic presumed by that there was in fact a dual system in Dayton as of 1954.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.882" offset="3416004">This gets into a whole lot of factual arguments which has been made and I might find out that today, we did file with the clerk to supplement the record the brief that we have filed in the Sixth Circuit on our initial appeal in this case where we went through those facts.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="843.806" offset="3475668">You meant three of your reasons, did you get to your report?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_c_greer" startTime="848.702" stopTime="1196.233">
            <label>Mr. David C. Greer</label>
            <text syncTime="848.702" offset="3495312">I have not gotten to it, but I will do that right now, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.253" offset="3509523">The fourth reason and I think this is as good reason as the other three is that if the remedial goal in a suit of this nature is as this court stated in Milliken to restore the victims of discriminatory conduct to the position they would have occupied in the absence of such conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.619" offset="3602936">A system wide remedy is inappropriate whereas here in Dayton, the evidence establishes that the racial composition of the schools reflected the changing racial composition of the neighborhoods that were serve by those schools and the attendance zones and boundaries of these schools met with no significant change over the 20 years that elapsed before the suit was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.315" offset="3709725">I submit to this court and anybody else who wants to ask me that there would have been no difference in the composition of the schools in the Dayton School system at the time this lawsuit was filed, regardless of how any act in 1926 or practice in 1933 or finding a fact in this case with regard to optional zones is characterized.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.188" offset="3809199">Just to be specific on that point, the schools in the Dayton system as of 1954 when the Brown case was decided consisted of four schools that were composed of an entirely black student population.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.557" offset="3878685">24 schools that had a mixed population of black and white students, and 21 of white schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.618" offset="3918914">During the 20 years that elapsed before the filing of this suit were no significant boundary changes and the schools needs various mixtures were affected only by population change.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.712" offset="3975338">There is a little pocket in the eastside of Dayton, the Washington Elementary School serves that area and the composition of the student body in that school has been somewhere around 23 or so percent consistently through this entire 20-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.391" offset="4058094">Other schools during these 20 years were entirely white in their student bodies at one point or mixed at one point, and as population shifted, the composition of the school shifted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.707" offset="4107309">So that by the end of the period, certain schools were predominantly black and you can list them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.997" offset="4140432">So that this is my fourth point that I would present to the court that if the purpose of a remedy in this kind of a case is to restore a condition that would have exited but for constitutional violations, there is no basis here for a system wide remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.455" offset="4242310">Now, I am sure the court is going to have a lot of questions for me as well as for my opponents, those are our four main answers to what has been an effort as I see it to try to persuade this court to rewrite the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.264" offset="4313572">I do not think that is a request that should be accepted by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.451" offset="4346277">We are not here, it seems to me to determine the correctness of the Trial Court’s findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.858" offset="4375952">What we are here to determine is to whether the findings of fact that had been made in this case support the remedy that has been imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.447" offset="4414300">It seems to me what the Department of Justice and what the plaintiffs in this case are asking is that this court designate itself and the Circuit Court of Appeals as fact finding commissions in every school desegregation case that is filed, that I submit is not a proper appellate function and that is, I submit the job of the prior of the facts the Trial Court who has the opportunity to develop those facts on a witness by witness basis through the pressure of cross examination and through examination of the witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.264" offset="4597575">Now, as far as the historical facts that are attempted to be put together out of a cold record in the brief that was filed by Department of Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.904" offset="4652119">I would submit that those facts simply leave great logical gaps that were filled in at the trial of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.265" offset="4697572">There has not been any instance cited to this court because there is none available for citation where a student in the Dayton School system was ever excluded from any school because of his grades.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.233" offset="4765385">There was an instance back in 1926 when a group of students at an Elementary School Garfield were taught in a separate building behind the main school that was a subject of a suit in 1926 and that practice was eliminated and that practice existed and was eliminated some four generations of students before this case was filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1400.176" offset="5701196">But the court found that in determining the optional zones, the school board did take into account feelings of the community whether they want it or not and in that respect, some insidious intent may have crept into the decision in these few zones.</text>

            <text syncTime="2252.416" offset="9110176">In order to provide school space for that population, the defendants contracted the boundaries of the original black schools that made them tighter boxes, locked them in to those boxes and expanded the boundaries of the periphery schools, which already have substantial black enrolments inward to give them a larger share of that black population.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.319" offset="9209754">At the same time, they cancelled their open transfer policy, which had permitted whites to get out of any situation where they did not want to stay, but instead substituted for it a series of optional attendance zones around the Westside stools on the white side of the periphery allowing whites to get out of those schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.710" offset="9291361">Simultaneously with that and in the context of their policy on faculty, they began assigning black teachers to those schools, so that those schools eventually became identified as the new black schools.</text>
