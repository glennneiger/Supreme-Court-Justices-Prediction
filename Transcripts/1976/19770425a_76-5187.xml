            <text syncTime="26.489" offset="206483">Mr. Chief Justice Burger and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.829" offset="219753">My name is Joseph Bauer, counsel for petitioner, Phillip Jerome Lee.</text>
            <text syncTime="34.674" offset="239188">This case involves issues under the Due Process Clause and the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.991" offset="264474">In Illinois v. Somerville, this Court observed that virtually all double jeopardy cases turn on the particular facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.584" offset="294777">Therefore, I would like to begin this morning with a brief statement of the facts, because that is essential for an understanding of the issues presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.275" offset="333542">In December 1973, a theft allegedly occurred in the United States’ Post Office.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.822" offset="359769">A few weeks later in 1974, a federal information was filed charging the petitioner with that theft.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.066" offset="396759">Petitioner waived his right to trial by jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.330" offset="409820">On the day of the trial and prior to the introduction of any evidence, counsel for petitioner moved to dismiss the information because it failed to allege a vital portion of that information, that is that theft requires that the act be committed knowingly and with an intent to deprive the owner of the use of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.898" offset="492053">He had an opportunity to make such a motion earlier in the proceedings, did he not?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph P. Bauer</label>
            <text syncTime="102.405" offset="510130">He might have made it earlier, Your Honor but in fact as the record indicates he was the second counsel for the petitioner, and he was appointed only seven weeks before the trial and it clearly could have been made earlier but it might not have been reasonable to have done so and there is no contention that the objection here was not timely.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.122" offset="600932">Clearly, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide for objection at any time during the trial.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="130.479" offset="622352">But my only suggestion is that an attorney who makes a motion that late in the game may well find a trial judge unprepared to pass on it at the particular moment that he makes it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="joseph_p_bauer" startTime="144.880" stopTime="185.995">
            <label>Mr. Joseph P. Bauer</label>
            <text syncTime="144.880" offset="680030">Your Honor, I think there were two responses to that inquiry: One, in certain circumstances the time may be so late that it would be difficult for the judge to rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.547" offset="722662">On the facts of this case however, when petitioner’s counsel made the objection, the petitioner’s counsel cited a single Indiana State case.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.437" offset="766234">It would have been very, very easy for the trial judge at that time to have taken a two minute or five minute recess, looked up the single case; the rule was as simple as it can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.908" offset="812106">Now, that is only known by hindsight but I suggest that the alternatives available at that time would have been to look up that single case.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.031" offset="892563">What had happened Your Honor was that the case had been called; the prosecution had made its opening statement which lasted all of about 45 seconds.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.176" offset="933209">The defendant’s counsel then appeared and at the very first opportunity on that morning defense counsel did raise the objection.</text>

            <text syncTime="229.391" offset="1018055">As I suggest Mr. Justice Blackmun, the motion was made before evidence commence.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.780" offset="1043550">Therefore under the tests in this case, it was at a stage before jeopardy attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.956" offset="1068314">Had the motion been acted upon at that time, there would have been no bar whatsoever to correct any information of having a proper trial, so that the defendant’s motion was clearly made before there would have been any double jeopardy inquiry implicated.</text>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="257.450" offset="1130277">So, what is your position that jeopardy have not attached?</text>

            <label>Mr. Joseph P. Bauer</label>
            <text syncTime="260.582" offset="1142816">Well, the Court in the Serfass case says that in a jury trial, jeopardy attaches when the jury is in paneled and that in a non-jeopardy case, jeopardy attaches when evidence commences.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.953" offset="1196314">Now, the testimony had not yet begun, so it is our position that jeopardy had not attached at that time and it seems that in this case, defense counsel had given the Court an equally important, had given the prosecution an opportunity to correct that mistake which was of the prosecution’s own creation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2123.667" offset="8595132">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.147" offset="8609030">This is the latest in the line of cases extending back to United States v. Perez in 1824.</text>
            <text syncTime="2133.184" offset="8633167">It involved the question of the permissibility of retrying a defendant whose first trial terminated prior to a finding of guilt or innocence by the finder of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.792" offset="8671619">It is, in our view, perhaps the easiest to decide of all of those cases, because it is governed by a clear and simple consideration that it was the defendant who thought the pre-verdict termination and he got what he requested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.305" offset="8729715">And before turning to the body of my argument, I just want to make one point about the facts just to be clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.339" offset="8761794">At two places in petitioner’s brief, Page 17 of his opening brief and Page 4 of his reply brief, he says that the defendant objected to proceeding with the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.392" offset="8826055">Now, we have been over this a little bit this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.330" offset="8837758">I cannot find in the Appendix anything that remotely resembles an objection to proceeding with the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.684" offset="8859178">What happened was he came in; waited until the trial began and the prosecutor had made his opening statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.116" offset="8892928">He then raised his objection and the Court upgraded him for the untimeliness of raising it and explained the difficulty of dealing with the motion at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.100" offset="8936919">Now on Page 8 of the Appendix, there is a statement which is somewhat ambiguous, and I just wanted to say what we think it means.</text>

            <text syncTime="2232.253" offset="9029497">Now, we do not take that to be an objection to proceeding with the trial when the judge later on refused to grant the motion at this time, but rather an apology on the part of counsel for the fact that he was so late.</text>

            <text syncTime="2388.225" offset="9653405">Now, the defendant may say, Your Honor there is a double jeopardy problem in this case, I do not want to be subjected to a trial on a faulty information, because if I am convicted the result will be that I will have to be -- and that set aside as I know it must be, the result will be that I will have to be subjected to two trials, he can say that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2432.250" offset="9829470">He tentatively denied the motion subject to reconsideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.032" offset="9844621">Later on the question is what significance is to be attached to the fact that the defendant made it at the particular point that he did make it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.909" offset="9884119">Now, we start our argument from a premise that is unchallenged by petitioner and indeed that is not subject to serious challenge having them conclusively settled many years ago in the Ball case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.817" offset="9927795">If a defendant is placed on trial on a defective indictment and that trial leads to a conviction, they subsequently set aside because of the defect in the indictment, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar a second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.217" offset="9977323">Now this is so despite the fact that the second trial will subject the defendant to continuing embarrassment, uncertainty, anxiety, and insecurity, will renew the ordeal that the trial itself may represent, and will subject them to the added expense that further defense ordinarily entails.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.641" offset="10051093">All of these considerations -- I do not mean to minimize them, because they principally underlie the strong policy of the Double Jeopardy Clause against multiple trials and criminal cases -- have been placed in the scales by this Court, and they have been found to be outweighed by the even stronger societal interest and fair trials ending in just judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.623" offset="10134999">Now, in view of the decision in Ball, it seems quite clear -- and I think my colleague in effect conceded it -- that had the Court erroneously denied petitioner’s motion to dismiss the information, the Double Jeopardy Clause would not have barred a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2525.450" offset="10202290">Petitioner’s argument is that because the District Court ruled correctly and dismissed the information in this case, he cannot be retried, but if the Court had erred and denied the motion to dismiss, he could have been retried to state the proposition.</text>

            <text syncTime="2919.375" offset="11777996">This is a pre-verdict termination case which Jenkins was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.893" offset="11800043">And this is a case like Giori (ph), and Somerville, and Jorn, and then the whole line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.729" offset="11831390">We think there is no material difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2936.198" offset="11845288">Nwo, to come back to Mr. Justice Stewart’s point, this case focuses on the difference if any between Ball and cases in which there is one added element that is if the trial was terminated prior to a finding of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.060" offset="11904742">Now, that fact, the pre-verdict termination, implicates only one interest other than those already considered in Ball that is protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause, and that interest is the valued right of the defendant as this Court has described it, to receive a verdict from the fact finder at the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.849" offset="11987916">This Court has long recognized that a defendant who has searched his value right by objection to a termination of the trial, you can have his objection overwritten only upon the showing that the Trial Court reasonably viewed the termination as manifestly necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.665" offset="12051132">In Giori, in Downum, in Somerville, the defendants asserted their desire to go to verdict by objecting to the mid-trial termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.384" offset="12086032">This Court was then confronted with the difficult question in each of those cases whether the ends of public justice sufficiently supported the decision of the trial judge to deny the defendant, the opportunity to submit his case to the jury of that trial and possibly to terminate the controversy then and there by means of an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.336" offset="12161787">Jorn was a similar case because in effect the defendant was deprived of any opportunity to register its objections for the termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.837" offset="12195851">But in this case, petitioner never disclosed the slightest interest in obtaining a formal finding of guilt or innocence from the judge at the first trial understandably enough in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.376" offset="12237960">Nor when he made his belated motion for dismissal following the prosecutor’s opening statement and it was tentatively denied subject to later reconsideration that petitioner expressed any objection to proceeding with the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.244" offset="12293444">Now here in urging that the Double Jeopardy Clause barred a second trial, petitioner expresses two grievances that he says justify the result he seeks: The first arises from the fact that although the challenge to the information came after commencement of the trial, jeopardy had not yet attached thus petitioner argues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.952" offset="12372334">He was forced to undergo a trial that was doomed from the start because of the defect and in the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="3073.513" offset="12394486">In his view, this procedure necessitated his undergoing two trials when the first of this was avoidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.374" offset="12421967">This argument parenthetically is virtually the exact opposite of the argument of the defendant in Illinois v. Somerville who insisted that his first trial was hardly pointless even though it could not have lead to a valid conviction in view of the possibility of a valid and binding acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.109" offset="12492915">Petitioner’s second complaint is that having been forced to undergo a trial on the defective information, he was then deprived of the benefit of the finding of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3108.275" offset="12533562">There are two fatal flaws in his argument: The first is that the situation here was largely his fault, because of the tardiness of his challenge to the information -- and I do not mean tardiness in the sense of non-compliance with Rule 12, but for Double Jeopardy purposes in the sense of the situation that was created.</text>

            <text syncTime="3467.648" offset="13971028">I would venture to say that most defendants would be delighted with the prospect of having a first trial that could result in a valid acquittal but not a valid conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.972" offset="14008331">And at which they would be given a complete preview of the prosecution’s case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.095" offset="14028811">Of course, not all of them would necessarily, but I think some of them would.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.223" offset="14045320">Moreover it seems likely that many defendants and petitioner’s position of the conclusion of trial having heard the judge’s tentative assessment of the evidence would prefer not to have a formal finding of guilt entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.146" offset="14101013">In other words, many defendants would consider that what happened at petitioner’s trial gave them the best of both worlds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.945" offset="14132256">The fact of the matter is that different defendants will have different desires, and there is only one way that we can know what a particular defendant’s desires are in a particular situation and that is if he tells us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.478" offset="14186381">If he makes no objection, it can reasonably be assumed that the course adapted is not objectionable to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.751" offset="14215534">He should not later be heard to say that he retroactively objects to the course that was pursued when such an objection conveniently immunizes him from any exposure to conviction and punishment for his crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.781" offset="14267570">To sum up, the position we urge is that the Double Jeopardy Clause bars a second trial in the following circumstances: First, when the first trial is ended in a valid judgment of conviction; second one, the first trial is resulted in an acquittal by the finder of fact; third, when the first trial has been terminated prior to verdict as it was here provided the defendant has objected to the pre-verdict termination or been deprived of any opportunity to object and the termination was not manifestly necessary.</text>
