            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100534">We will hear argument next in 54 Original, the United States against Florida and Texas.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lee C. Clyburn</label>
            <text syncTime="41.785" offset="267613">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.953" offset="280256">My name is Lee Clyburn and I am an Assistant Attorney General of the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.862" offset="295930">However, for purposes of the argument today, I will be representing the views of both the States of Texas and Florida since there are no divergence or independent issues as to those two defendant States.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.605" offset="342950">The issue before the Court today is whether the defendants in this original proceeding will be allowed to file a counterclaim normally against the United States of America.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.191" offset="381298">The Special Master has filed a report recommending that the counterclaim not be filed because of the United States Sovereign Immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.365" offset="413899">The defendant States urged this Court to refuse to apply the Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity in the mechanical, uncritical manner advocated by the United States and to grant leave to file this counterclaim so that full justice maybe done herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.365" offset="481922">This is strictly a lawsuit for declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.042" offset="500625">It was originally filed by the United States against the States of Florida and Texas, seeking a declaration that neither defendant had any right to control fishing by foreign vessels or their crews in the seas more than three miles off their shores.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.432" offset="570216">The States answered and opposed the United States’ request for declaratory relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.146" offset="593099">The States each assert that they do possess the right to enforce their laws at all points within their boundaries, which boundaries in the case of each of these two States extend three leagues or non-geographical miles into the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.534" offset="666660">It became clear as discovery progressed in this lawsuit that the United States’ true position was that the defendant States not only did not have any rights to enforce their laws outside of three miles, but indeed that the defendant States of Florida and Texas had no rights to enforce their fisheries laws as against foreign nationals even in the three mile zone between the shore and three miles out for the traditional territorial sea of the United States have been locating.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.688" offset="787241">And are to clear out the whole question of the respective rights of the parties with regards to this important issue of offshore law enforcement rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.847" offset="823917">The defendants have filed their joint motion for leave to file a counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.355" offset="849935">By that counterclaim, the States seek only a declaration by this Court that they each do have the authority to enforce their fisheries laws as against foreign vessels and their crews within three miles from their shores.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.111" offset="920883">United States opposes the filing of the counterclaim relying primarily upon the Doctrine of the United States Sovereign Immunity from sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.978" offset="956410">The Special Master in his report filed with this Court finds that the expeditious and orderly procedures in this lawsuit would dictate the allowance of the filing of the counterclaim, but the Special Master felt that the decisions of this Court required him to recommend that the counterclaim not be allowed to even be filed because of the Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.700" offset="1059332">The defendant States fully concur with the Special Master’s findings that absent the issue of Sovereign Immunity, the counterclaim should be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.003" offset="1096531">We strongly accept, however, to the recommendation of the Special Master that the counterclaim should be barred by operation of the Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.062" offset="1140730">No case known to the defendants requires acceptance of the United States’ position on this matter.</text>

            <text syncTime="277.620" offset="1210947">It is my understanding that the Solicitor General is going to explicitly bring that tort decision to the Court's -- that statute to the Court’s attention for whatever bearing it might have.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.481" offset="1250444">I, myself, do not feel that it has bearing on the issue today or further the counterclaim should be allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.223" offset="1285344">We feel that only an absolutely uncritical adherence to the most technical view of the position of the Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity in our country would require or even allow the result urged by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.848" offset="1347829">On the other hand, the filing and adjudication of the counterclaim would allow the entire disagreement between the parties to be dealt with in this lawsuit and that full justice could be done herein to all parties to this lawsuit and not just to the United States.</text>

            <text syncTime="338.881" offset="1455976">Mr. Justice Blackmun, it is true that the issue that we raise in our counterclaim would probably be of interest to the other coastal states as well as merely to our two States or defendants in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.487" offset="1502474">It is, however, our position that they should certainly not stand in the way of the filing for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.690" offset="1527238">The issue, is of very great importance to these states in this lawsuit, and it seems to us almost incredible that United States would say that it should not, that the counterclaim should not be filed merely because other States’ legitimate interest would be called into question by the counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.517" offset="1598500">They have called into question and now they refuse to allow the issue to be adjudicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="385.378" offset="1641967">You are saying that the other states who might be implicated along the lines of Mr. Justice Blackmun’s question should also be allowed to intervene in the proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="401.318" offset="1705706">I do not, what I am saying that it is of interest to us, it is legitimately raised in this lawsuit and we should be able to adjudicate it by counterclaim.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.404" offset="1738098">If other states sought to intervene, the Court would have to deal with that question; United States would have to respond to that at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.929" offset="1780207">The United States in its brief to this Court makes the following statement that clearly demonstrates what we feel is the arrogance and unyielding nature of its position, and I quote from Page 7 of their Brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.721" offset="1831407">“In sum, defendants’ arguments that adjudication of their counterclaim is imperative less justice be denied, misses the point.”</text>
            <text syncTime="442.444" offset="1870278">Now, I point out to the Court that for reasons best known to the government they fit for the word “Justice” in that page from their brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.958" offset="1912283">Be that as it may, it seems to defendants that in this Court inquiries and to the justice and fairness of a given result never miss the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.879" offset="1955959">To the contrary, that inquiry, that inquiry as to what is fair and what is just, should always be exactly the point and it is on that point that United States’ position completely fails.</text>

            <text syncTime="496.946" offset="2088243">It is the States’ position, however, that the case is cited and all of the cases indeed reported and relied upon for the application of the Doctrine of Sovereign Immunity where cases are distinguishable from this one in the effect, the possible effect that the filing of either the suit or counterclaim might have on the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.039" offset="2168596">In this lawsuit our position that the counterclaim would have no adverse effect or embarrassment to the United States whatsoever.</text>

            <text syncTime="602.665" offset="2511114">I would point out that the State of Texas, has filed in its answer an allegation that no justiceable case or controversy as to it exist and it is for precisely the reason that there has not been any clashes between the 10.18 boats of the lights, between the State of Texas and the United States that we raise that point in defense to this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.715" offset="2599303">So, the States’ position, in a nutshell, is that there is no justiceable case or controversy as to Texas with regards to the United States’ original request for the declaratory relief.</text>

            <label>Mr. William F. Sheehan</label>
            <text syncTime="1054.854" offset="4319936">The States have taken the position that they do have those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.751" offset="4339476">They assert that their authority in this connection to either at least in part from the 1953 Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.847" offset="4367897">That Act, of course, granted to the States' rights on the natural resources within the territorial sea, granted to all of the coastal states those rights in the territorial sea and as to the States of Texas and Florida, it granted those rights out to a distance of nine miles in the Gulf of Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.989" offset="4440413">The defendant states are, therefore, the only states that can assert a claim of jurisdiction over foreign vessels beyond the territorial sea on the basis of proprietary interests granted by the Submerged Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.878" offset="4487956">They are indeed the only states that have asserted in this fashion such a claim and they are accordingly the only states named by the United States as the defendants in this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.910" offset="4528080">Counterclaim that the States could bring, involves rights in the three-mile territorial sea.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.489" offset="4546470">Those rights affect the concern of every coastal state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.617" offset="4562980">We have objected to that counterclaim on grounds of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.783" offset="4579594">Our argument proceeds in four steps: First, that the United States may not be sued without its consent; second, that the rule applied with equal force when the plaintiff is a state; third, that the United States has not consented to this lawsuit by statute; and fourth, that it has not consented to this lawsuit by virtue of having initiated a complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.456" offset="4666320">The first proposition needs, we think, very little elaboration as the Court stated last term in Testan and it has long been established of course that the United States as a sovereign is immune from suit, save, if it consents to be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.091" offset="4712818">Likewise, the second proposition is established beyond doubting our view, the exemption of the United States from being sued without its consent extends to a suit by a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.354" offset="4753883">I think the last time this Court had occasion to state that rule squarely was in Hawaii against Gordon in 373 United States reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1172.867" offset="4791917">Our third proposition is that the United States by statute has not consented to this suit and indeed the states have never claimed otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.339" offset="4821801">In this connection, I will raise the legislation enacted last October by Congress and I am referring to the waiver of immunity that Congress worked as an amendment to the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.502" offset="4886480">We have included a copy of the Amended Administrative Procedure Act as an appendix in our Reply Brief in Matthews against Mr. Sanders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1204.059" offset="4916678">That waiver of immunity has no affect in this case, which is not a suit to review agency action brought under the Administrative Procedure Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.398" offset="4950114">Another piece of legislation that is not referred to in the brief is the act last year by Congress, the Fishery Conservation and Management Act of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.211" offset="4993373">By that Act, Congress extended its exclusive fisheries jurisdiction to a limit of 200 miles from the coastline.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.848" offset="5023884">That Act leaves this lawsuit where it finds it in Section 306 of the Act, it says explicitly that nothing contained in the Act shall have any impact either to enlarge or to diminish the jurisdiction of the states within their boundaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.193" offset="5085220">That, of course, is the issue posed by the United States complaint, what is the jurisdiction of the state within their boundaries in the three to nine mile area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.086" offset="5116776">There is a provision for suit in the Act extending the exclusive fisheries jurisdiction of the United States after 200 miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.118" offset="5148958">That provision for suit does not contemplate suits by states in as much as it provides for exclusive jurisdiction of cases or controversies arising under the Act in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.358" offset="5193889">Congress could not have contemplated that that states would sue under that provision and as much as the constitution gives this Court original, although not exclusive, jurisdiction over actions in which state maybe a party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.764" offset="5243522">That provision for suit also is of no aid to the states from this case because it provides only for suits in the District Court not in the Supreme Court, and finally it is of no aid to the states because it does not take effect until March 1, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.182" offset="5313216">Thus, the United States has not, by any statute, consented to be sued in the matter that the states seek to do and so the issue becomes whether the United States by initiating a lawsuit consents to be sued.</text>

            <text syncTime="1590.654" offset="6463127">If, in fact, the Sovereign Immunity is, as the Federal Government asserts, absolute but for statutory waiver, then indeed we probably do like the right to assert this counterclaim.</text>

            <text syncTime="1618.624" offset="6574931">In order to completely determine an issue where the Federal Government enters into litigation and where there is no danger to the public interest then this is the most appropriate case to apply that doctrine in The Thekla.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.919" offset="6636162">In that case, this Court asserted the reasons that have prevailed against creating a government liability in tort do not apply to a case like this and on the other hand, the reasons are strong for not obstructing the application of natural justice against the government by technical formulas, when justice can be done without endangering any public interest.</text>
