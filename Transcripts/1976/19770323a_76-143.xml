            <text syncTime="54.479" offset="217861">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, this case is here because the petitioner has been convicted for violation of California obscenity law.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.664" offset="254642">Facts are quite simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.706" offset="266762">In 1969, the petitioner ran a store in Northern California from which he sold books and films with sexual contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.285" offset="301140">Prior to the events that occurred which led to the conviction, the police had become aware of the store and it purchased material for sale regularly in the store but apparently none of this material was the type that they felt was suited for prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.134" offset="356519">So, they sent in someone who was a part-time policeman and otherwise, a carpet layer who was seeking, in his words, hardcore material which -- by which --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="100.391" stopTime="108.175">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="100.391" offset="401554">Is there -- is there any dispute or issue remaining about whether this is obscenity in this case?</text>
            <text syncTime="106.824" offset="427259">I thought that was out of the case.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_wells_jr" startTime="108.175" stopTime="293.470">
            <label>Mr. Arthur Wells, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="108.175" offset="432692">No, I -- I don't think it -- the issue of whether its obscenity is out of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.687" offset="450664">I didn't raise the issue of whether the material was obscene or not because as I understand Miller, the only question asked to the content of the material is whether or not it is the type that is -- that could be found by properly instructed jury to be obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.019" offset="516075">The two films here graphically display ultimate sexual acts, they are not simulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.294" offset="533107">And therefore, they are the type that could be found obscene if the jury were properly instructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.545" offset="554109">In this case, we claim that evidence was improperly introduced and that the jury was not properly instructed and that's why there was a conviction, but it's because of the holding in Miller that we have not raised at this point a claim as to the content for the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.858" offset="615340">I might also point out that the term hardcore as used in this case by the participants was not a concession that the material was obscene but only that the material graphically displayed ultimate sex acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.665" offset="670616">In other words, in 1969 and 1970, the state of the art was what was publicly for sale was simulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.941" offset="699664">That is borne out by the record and I would refer you to pages 515 through 517, 574, 619, 683 and 684 and 762 in which all of the people who had anything to do with the store and Mr. Drivon, the policeman, indicated that they were talking about material which actually showed sex acts rather than which showed simulated sexual acts.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.816" offset="803213">In any event, Drivon in order to accomplish the test of acquiring some hardcore material, some material which graphically displayed sexual behavior which require to make six contexts with the store, only one of those contexts was with the petitioner, Mr. Splawn, and I think it is significant that at that context, the petitioner told Mr. Drivon that he could go to San Francisco and get these films himself if he wish and Mr. Drivon begged off from that invitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.076" offset="924212">Finally, then after six contexts, Drivon purchased two films for $70 for which petitioner was convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.283" offset="957127">He had been tried not only for the crime of displaying and distributing obscene material but also on the felony conspiracy charge with his twin brother and the clerk and there was an acquittal on the felony charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.246" offset="1020970">At the trial, certain instructions were given which were based on Ginsberg versus United States and our common law would referred to as instructions that our based on the pandering doctrine and there were other instructions which I will discuss the content of more specifically later.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.413" offset="1093590">In any event, the case presents three issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.989" offset="1107905">The first issue arises because the pandering law of California which was incorporated into instructions was not in effect at the time that the defendant or the petitioner sold films for which he was subsequently convicted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="293.470" stopTime="301.215">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="293.470" offset="1173838">Mr. Wells, let me just ask you primarily question.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.725" offset="1186900">I take that the -- your argument about equal protection is not before us.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="arthur_wells_jr" startTime="301.215" stopTime="946.524">
            <label>Mr. Arthur Wells, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="301.215" offset="1204767">No, you did not grant cert on that issue and I did not brief that issue in the brief and I do not intend to address myself to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.874" offset="1235487">You limited your grant to certiorari to the first four questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.381" offset="1261505">Because the law was not none in effect at the time, an ex post facto which it was raised.Similarly, the California Supreme Court less than two years before the sale which is the subject matter to this lawsuit had ruled that pandering was not part of California law, and therefore, a question arises under the Due Process Clause and Bouie versus Columbia as to whether there was a new and novel and unfair application of state law to this defendant such that he was denied due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.611" offset="1402358">The behavior engaged in by the -- by the petitioner in this case displays no more than a simple sale and the Court of Appeals opinion which is here in question, refers to no behavior by the petitioner except that of a simple sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.166" offset="1456588">Under the circumstances, the question is raised about whether the pandering instructions both based on the law and as given by the Court in this case should have been given at all because in the petitioner's view, these instructions are lopsided.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.130" offset="1516460">They do not fairly represent the proposition for which they supposed to support instead they represent only a prosecution view.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.763" offset="1555017">Third, on the assumption that it was properly give instructions on the subject of the contexts in the behavior rather than just on the subject matter of the material, of course, it is presented as to whether these instructions are proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.741" offset="1606949">Now, I would like to discuss these matters in reverse order.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.274" offset="1628996">I think Miller, if it teaches us one thing, says that local juries and local jurisdictions are going to have a lot more to say about what is and what is not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.954" offset="1679778">This Court sits not to find what is obscene but just as it check to determine what is not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.760" offset="1706945">I think if you are going to have rules which say that you're going to have a not completely defined local community as the community by which the judge was obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.593" offset="1746338">And if you're going to have a rule that requires no evidence at all except the material itself, they introduce to support a conviction in what you have to insists on is properly instructed jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.306" offset="1797224">I urge this Court to elaborate on and adopt its recent remarks in Footnote 11 of Marks versus U.S. which is to the effect that there is no substitute for properly instructed jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.281" offset="1845081">I think this especially important in a case like this because what we're talking about is the content of books and movies and other material, which by the way is pure speech, this isn't picketing case, this isn't an O'Brien situations, this isn't anything but pure speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.840" offset="1919269">And I think what we're talking about is questions of aesthetics, questions of taste and questions of social value and we're trying to convey to a group of layman what it is that they have to do to make a judgment which can rise to a level of constitutional judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.117" offset="1988441">Now, I think then that what we need is as much clarity and precision as we can get.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.531" offset="2006100">Otherwise, we have no insurance, the jury is located someplace else and without the necessary guidance of any evidence with the material itself and applying a local community is going to do what you nine people wanted to do or what -- a larger group than that wanted to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.259" offset="2076944">Therefore, I think it's very important to stick to what we have if that's what we have to live with.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.317" offset="2109231">Now, the worst, the most glaring example of error I think are the instructions as given is the instruction that says that the jury is permitted to look to the sexually provocative aspects of the matter to determine if the material lacks value.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.240" offset="2180911">Now if they find the material is sexually provocative, that fact alone is enough to find that the material lacked value.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.861" offset="2215393">This to me is an extremely insidious instruction for the following reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.387" offset="2233469">The core thing in the obscenity field, the thing that has been with us since Roth is the notion of prurience.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.411" offset="2265548">If there is any governmental interest at all in -- in this field, if there is any reason for the States to be in it at all, it is only because this material on some theory or supported by some set of facts is harmful, is unhealthy and that's what prurience means.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.780" offset="2335033">Prurience indicates this obsessive compulsion with the unhealthy aspects of sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.544" offset="2370142">Provocativeness is an entirely different thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.077" offset="2384248">Provocativeness has to do with arousal, being aroused, being excited, being provoke and that is not necessarily unhealthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.023" offset="2424059">Now, what happens is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.054" offset="2432209">Prurience, as far as, I can see is a difficult concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.044" offset="2452167">It's a difficult term because you're dealing of health and lack of health in a large community of people who you have to judge it by.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.969" offset="2483827">And I don't think that the layman, the common juror is acquainted with the term prurience, uses it or things in terms of those notions.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.844" offset="2511308">On the other hand, provocativeness especially sexual provocativeness is something that we all grow up with.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.354" offset="2533355">Chewing gum, cars, there is nothing that is not sold partially on the basis of provocativeness and usually sexual provocativeness.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.875" offset="2571494">Cigarettes for years were sold with implied -- and still are in billboards but not on television, implied sexual attractiveness from smoking.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.820" offset="2607229">I therefore think that what happens if you permit the type of instruction given here and what indeed probably did happen here is that the jury says to itself, but we're supposed to deal with this notion of prurience but I'm not too sure what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.193" offset="2656758">And under Miller, maybe we don't have any evidence regarding it but the judge said something about provocativeness, maybe I'll look at it and see if I think it's provocative.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.392" offset="2693538">If it's provocative, then I don't have to worry about the rest and so they substitute provocativeness or a judgment about whether the material is provocative for a judgment about whether the material is prurient.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.914" offset="2739618">And that is the worst possible thing that can be done in this field for the reason that the only reason for having the rules about obscenity if there are any reasons is that the material is unhealthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.975" offset="2787892">And if the judgment is made on the basis of provocativeness rather than prurience, then you're not making the judgment on the basis of the material is unhealthy but just that it excites or arouses somebody.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.289" offset="2833136">And the fact -- the fact that something arouses or excites somebody is probably one of the reasons why it should have First Amendment protection, not one of the reasons that it shouldn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.868" offset="2867409">And of course the other thing about the term sexual provocativeness is that it's vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.263" offset="2884963">Vague in both the senses that it's not final enough that we can draw a line so that we can protect -- protected speech and not protect -- not protected speech and vague in the sense that you are using the term can't tell me what I'm supposed to do and so I don't have any real notice about what I'm supposed to do and the jury has no real notice about what its supposed to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.908" offset="2983602">The other fundamental area in the instruction -- and the instructions in this case was the instruction which permitted the jury to look again at the material after it supposedly applied the three tests which at that time we have to pull a memoir's test and judge it in terms of the intent of the creator.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.011" offset="3063954">Whatever maybe the value of such a test, it has never been applied by this Court in the case of a retail seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.775" offset="3095092">Hamling was a producer, Ginzburg was a producer, Rebhuhn, who in 1940 was the person about whom Learned Hand wrote the opinion which you said was a good opinion in Ginzburg, was the man who mailed out -- made and mailed out the flyers in that case and its never been applied to a person in any event, the man isn't on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.404" offset="3185580">That is to say the -- the publisher is not on trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.004" offset="3203971">So what you do is you look again at the material and you say, “Well, what is the intent of the person who made this material?”</text>
            <text syncTime="810.211" offset="3240751">Now, that should never be the judgment about whether the material is obscene or not because what we're trying to do is get to an objective standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.773" offset="3271053">We are trying to apply a standard which is a standard of lack of health, unhealthiness, and the motives of the creator are not what we're talking about when we're talking about prurience.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.442" offset="3321731">If you want to get the creator of the material, then you use the investigative facilities to go arrest him and -- on this type of theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.089" offset="3364258">I supposed you're trying for something like attempt to make a dirty book or attempt to make obscene books, then you're talking solely about his -- his motives.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.495" offset="3401979">Under this, you have a subjective standard instead of an objective standard and once again, it redefines any of the tests laid down by this Court and because it's easier for the jury to apply that kind of a test, just look at the -- we know what he was trying to do, then they're going to substitute that test for the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.441" offset="3493721">Now, the next point is a question about whether these instructions should have been given at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.358" offset="3521411">To this extent, I think Ginzburg is a confusing case.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.890" offset="3539487">What happen in Ginzburg is that, there was a holding that context was important, but the context to that case was that a publisher exploited his materials.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.011" offset="3599987">And the question is, whether you're going to have a rule which permits the context to be considered or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.956" offset="3635722">In this case, what -- what California did, is first of all, would pass a statute, they didn't say consider the whole context.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.639" offset="3662472">It said, see if the guy is misusing the material, and I admit that was part of Ginzburg verus United States, but that's only because of the facts of Ginzburg which were entirely different from the facts here, mainly because you have a publisher and control there and you don't have one here.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.453" offset="3721718">Here, what you have is a retailer and if you don't limit the rules somehow and let him know what he can do and not do, there is no way he is going to have any idea and I think its really going to leave to a self--censorship thing, merely putting --</text>

            <text syncTime="946.524" offset="3786083">Is there any evidence in the record here Mr. Wells as to whether this retailer ran a totally what you might call adult bookstore or whether he had an adult section and non-adult section?</text>

            <text syncTime="961.693" offset="3846687">The fact of the matter is he did run an adult bookstore, the pictures that were introduced as the matter -- exhibit four which were introduced on a pandering theory show the inside of the store and they show magazines displayed in their covers.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.949" offset="3923696">I would urge, I am reading over my brief, I see that -- well, I complained a lot that the conviction was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.525" offset="3946057">I did not suggest what would be an appropriate rule and I think the object -- the court's opinion, if its reaches this issue, should be to limit the application of this rule if you're going to have it at all to a very finite definite set of circumstances because otherwise in a field where I feel that you're at your limits of possible use of words to be able to convey ideas, you just can't go any further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.975" offset="4075833">Now, I would point out that Ginzburg permitted the use of this doctrine as a rebuttal tool, quickly -- strictly a question in that case or it could be read to be are the integrity of the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.172" offset="4132676">Ginzburg had been out in Middlesex and Blue Ball, Pennsylvania, going crazy with this material and it wasn't a material itself, he was exploiting it, okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.063" offset="4184189">And then he run into Court and said, “Oh, this is really pure stuff.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.938" offset="4199654">Now, as a mere factual rebuttal to that, the Government said, wait minute, you said one thing out there just to show that you're not credible, that you're not to be believed, a different thing should be permitted to be shown here.I would urge you to limit the application of the rule to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.902" offset="4271543">If you're not going to do that, if you're going to go further, then I would say that you should limit a behavior which is unambiguous exploitation because what you have to do is draw the distinction between commercial exploitation and commercial behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.026" offset="4340088">If you don't permit some behavior in this field, then you're going to cut out everything out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.210" offset="4356807">People are not going to do anything in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.685" offset="4366733">Now, I would -- the only good analogy I can think of and it isn't really right on point, just to refresh your recollection about the clear and present danger test, that is the other test that's used to determine if protected speech should not be protected because of the context in which it's used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.840" offset="4443324">Here, if you've got material which is borderline or material which is not -- which the Government apparently doesn't feel it can be made obscene without reference to the context and therefore, it's going to use the context, the question should be whether the behavior of the defendant was such that that it's clear and immediate that there was exploitation of the unhealthy aspects of the material rather than support of the material that has value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.096" offset="4604343">You've had these kinds of rules before and to go not too far field, that is to stand a criminal law field, I point out to you that you have a warrant requirement and that you require warrants to go into premises unless you have exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.396" offset="4653558">And the exceptions are only that wide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.410" offset="4661603">The one I think of that's useful here is the exigent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.400" offset="4681561">In order to get around the warrant by saying, a one requirement by saying exigent circumstances permitted us not to get the warrant, the behavior has to be clear and ambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.393" offset="4721476">There are hosts of -- Court Of Appeals cases still holds in Wong Sun for instance as I recall it is a case where the man knocking on the door or the policeman knocking on the door and footsteps are running away and that's still held to be ambiguous and, therefore, not a sufficient exigent circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.616" offset="4786364">Here, you should require a specific unambiguous act which you had in the case as it had been before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.047" offset="4824085">You have specific advertising which have -- which have emphasized the prurient, fallacious aspects of material, sort of to formulate such a rule doesn't require you to withdraw a cutback or overrule any cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.911" offset="4899631">Lastly, I would address myself to the issue of -- to the ex post facto issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.931" offset="4947696">I think the key here is the question of what does this pandering rule do to a natural trial of an obscenity case and I think its rather clear that it fundamentally changes the focus and that it makes the whole different ball game than you would have when you just look at the four corners of the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.772" offset="5055007">The Government and the Court of Appeals tend to treat this as a rule of evidence and -- and I think that that's just putting a label on something and I don't think its doing -- I don't think it's solving the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.241" offset="5116865">There are a lots of different kinds of evidence rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.070" offset="5124180">There are evidence rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.007" offset="5127941">It shift the burden of proof to deal with the burden of who has to go forward and not deal with the quality of evidence, some kinds of judgments can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.444" offset="5161691">Oh, you have to have percipient evidence, other kinds you have to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.608" offset="5174335">I mean hearsay is adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.154" offset="5180604">There are probably are couple where double hearsay would be adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.080" offset="5196278">There are rules of evidence that cover who can give evidence and who can't give evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.773" offset="5215086">But a rule that actually defines what is material in a given case is that kind of rule of evidence that is a substantial contributor to -- to the parameters of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.873" offset="5283422">For instance, if you change the rule of evidence to permit the question -- well, if you use narcotics, then it might be relevant in a custody case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.451" offset="5325740">If you change the rules of evidence in a breach of contract case, it permit evidence that someone used narcotics on the theory that people use narcotics or less likely to perform contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.576" offset="5366282">That would be a change in a rule of evidence that seemed to me to be material enough that you couldn't apply it retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.527" offset="5394077">Here, I think there was a clear change which was a big surprise because of People versus Noroff which by my view the California Supreme Court clearly said, “We are not going to have a pandering rule unless a legislature passes it.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.089" offset="5452278">I would like to save the rest of my time for rebuttal if there were no questions.</text>

            <label>Mr. William Douglas Stein</label>
            <text syncTime="1377.369" offset="5509433">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.359" offset="5521345">I'm William Stein representing the people of the State of California in this obscenity prosecution an area in the law which I submit we've all probably written in red way too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.225" offset="5572859">I believe that petitioner's argument today is based on an erroneous premise and that is that he has been convicted somehow of advertising or promoting the sale of obscene matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.886" offset="5615491">It's true that California recognizes an offense of that nature but petitioner was not charge nor convicted of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.044" offset="5648091">He was convicted simply of the act of selling obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.777" offset="5667004">At trial, the prosecution introduced evidence of the circumstances of the production and dissemination of these two films as material on the question of whether they were obscene under the -- then Roth memoirs' definition of obscenity, a definition under which the prosecution and the juries of California still labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.195" offset="5744744">Now, petitioner clever way of phrasing this, he uses the -- he refers to this evidence of dissemination and production as evidence of pandering and then argues that the instructions relating it to the definition of obscenity resulted in his conviction of -- for pandering, a crime with which he claim -- which he was not charged concededly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.302" offset="5845159">I submit that we can establish that the jury was not confused in this manner very simply.Petitioner was not charged alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.490" offset="5869923">Petitioner had a twin brother, Don, who was with the same offense and in a matter of fact, on all of the occasions when Mr. Drivon went to the bookstore to talk about purchasing these films as petitioner pointed out a few minutes ago, he talked mainly with Don, and Don was charged with selling obscene material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.592" offset="5962292">Don was acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.997" offset="5975980">The evidence that petitioner refers to is pandering.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.300" offset="5985176">It was mainly the statements of Don, but jury was going to be confused and somehow thought that this evidence made it a crime to pander.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.696" offset="6014746">They would have convicted Don along with Roy, but the twin brother Don was acquitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.883" offset="6035435">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.340" offset="6037316">Because the jury understood exactly what the judge told them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.095" offset="6052362">The evidence only went to the issue of social value, one of the three definition elements of obscenity in California at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.444" offset="6085695">Selling obscene material is a simple crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.765" offset="6094994">It has, as I see it, only two elements, the knowing sale of obscene matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1529.138" offset="6116519">All of this other evidence goes to the three definitional requirements of obscenity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.808" offset="6139193">So, we submit the petitioner was convicted solely of the act of selling obscene films and if by using this phrase pandering is a verb, he attempts to distract us from this very simple fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.787" offset="6219128">I believe that after all these years there were little confusion between the parties as to what the facts in the case were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.608" offset="6250371">I think there is general agreement and I only had one think that struck me during the petitioner's argument and that's when he said that the defendant told Mr. Drivon, the officer, purchased the films that if he really wanted these films you can go San Francisco, get them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.298" offset="6325185">I'll refer to the transcript, the page -- of trial page 37, lines 24 through 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.003" offset="6367922">Question to Mr. Drivon, Mr. Drivon talking about the conversations he had states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.071" offset="6392268">He, referring to the twin brother Don, did suggest that if I was in a real hurry to obtain some films that he could go to San Francisco to get them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.819" offset="6443259">I submit the reference is not that he, Mr. Drivon, did go to San Francisco but then if they was in a real big hurry, Don's plan would be willing to satisfy him by going to San Francisco about 30 miles up the road to get these films and bring them right back.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.184" offset="6508669">It would made it of course made no sense for Mr. Drivon to go to San Francisco since the bookstore here was in the suburban community in California or (Inaudible) Community, San Mateo County and that's where the prosecution was attempting to limit the distribution of this material.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.698" offset="6586723">Okay, the brief also states that the petitioner makes point of the fact that Mr. Drivon had to come back again and again as though he was the moving force in this and was somehow entrapping if you will the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.174" offset="6652656">But if any -- if you read the record and every one of those inferences, everytime he comes back there's more of them, the more pandering is done by the defendant, this petitioners or his brother and his employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.970" offset="6731860">I think an answer to what Mr. Justice Rehnquist's question I want to point out there was an additional exhibit here consisting a 41 photograph that was taken of the interior of bookstore at the time the arrest was made which establishes the, sort of the nature of the place where this activity was taking place where the statements as to the films were being made which was evidenced of the petitioner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1716.326" offset="6865293">Okay, this is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.461" offset="6869786">There are two procedures that happened during the trial which I think is very important to the outcome of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.151" offset="6892565">Before the trial was made, before the trial has happened, petitioner made the non--statutory motion recognizing California under people versus Noroff to have the case dismissed on the grounds that as a matter of law, these films were not obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.373" offset="6945437">The motion was denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.524" offset="6954005">The case went to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.397" offset="6957558">At the close of prosecution's case, defendant made a motion under our statutory provision for a directive verdict of acquittal on the specific grounds and the reference to this is in the transcript at page 495, that there had been no evidence introduced that these films lack social value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.770" offset="7027043">That motion was also denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.648" offset="7038537">The reason being, of course of the prosecution had introduced, evidences recorded recognizing Ginzburg is probative on the definition elements of obscenity as they were laid down at the time it brought memories.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.138" offset="7100500">Because the evidence of production and dissemination is relevant to this definition, the jury was instructed that in determining whether the films were utterly without redeeming social importance, and as a sideline, I'd like to say most of this evidence and all of this instruction went to social importance as opposed to appearing in appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.538" offset="7178136">Okay, whether they could consider the circumstances of sale and distribution, particularly whether such circumstances indicated these films were commercially exploited by petitioner for the sake of their apparent appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.549" offset="7222126">They were informed such evident -- evidence was probative with respect to the nature of the films and can justify the conclusion that they were utterly without redeeming social value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.890" offset="7259533">The weight of any of the evidence of course was left to the jury specifically instructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.600" offset="7278341">Now, the jury, with respect to social importance of sexual provocativeness in point petitioner made during his oral argument, the jury was further instructed that evidence of the circumstances of production and dissemination were relevant for determining whether social importance claim for the film was in the circumstances pretense the reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1838.827" offset="7355246">And if they concluded that the purveyor sole emphasis, sole emphasis was on the sexual provocative aspect of these films, that fact could justify the conclusion that the matter was utterly without redeeming social importance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.356" offset="7409371">Roy Splawn was not trying to sell Lucky Strike cigarettes or anything else by having a pinup girl.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.523" offset="7430060">He was making the -- the purveyor was the sole emphasis on the sexual aspects of these films that's recognized as irrelevant to social value and that's how the jury was instructed here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2976.760" offset="11907030">Now, as far as the fact that the -- that Mr. Splawn was not the creator, I doubt that Hamling created the photographs that he put together and assembled in this thing and disseminated it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3023.758" offset="12095007">What was his intent?</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.705" offset="12098769">That's important to determining the social value of that material, what he was intending to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3029.476" offset="12117891">Roy Splawn, his testimony, he made a phone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.464" offset="12129802">He'd seen the movies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.128" offset="12136490">He knew what was in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.965" offset="12143804">And so, I think the fact that Roy Splawn didn't create the movies, there's no evidence that he did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.196" offset="12164702">It doesn't preclude giving these instructions, or preclude the prosecution from using this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.183" offset="12212663">I think it's important too to point out that the jury was never instructed that they could substitute this evidence for any of the definitional requirements of Roth Memoirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.351" offset="12253309">They were instructed that the purveyor's emphasis was on the sexually provocative aspects of the film.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.225" offset="12280895">The motive of the creator was an appeal to sexual curiosity and appetite by animating sensual detail as to give the film a salacious cast, that that was evidence that the films were obscene but they were never instructed they could jerk that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.737" offset="12334916">If we can't understand the Roth Memoirs test, we'll just junk that and we'll go to his evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.517" offset="12354038">That's not in those instructions, barely written.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.304" offset="12365113">They merely advised the jury that the evidence of the circumstances of production and dissemination were probative with respect to petitioner's claim of redeeming social value and could justify the jury's conclusion that his claims were pretense for litigation, not the way he sold these materials to Arvin Drivon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.471" offset="12441809">I'd just say the imbalance that -- the statute is cast in terms of the prosecution evidence, but the prosecution bears the burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.784" offset="12471066">But Ginzburg recognizes the probative value of the evidence, and if the defendant had introduced evidence, if he treated these films seriously, he would have -- I concede that he would be entitled to a similar instruction, that the jury could consider the way he considered the film as probative in social value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3134.325" offset="12537208">The evidence, the instructions are weighed in favor of the prosecution because that's all the evidence there was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.858" offset="12555389">And the fact that the statute's weighed in favor of the prosecution, it doesn't mean the only evidence that they are being treated in a pandering manner is admissible evidence for those instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.460" offset="12597812">I want to thank the Court for you attention, if there's no other questions, I appreciate it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3155.568" offset="12622263">Yes, I have a brief rebuttal which will be shotgunned, for which I apologize.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.461" offset="12645773">The reference in the record to the statement where Mr. Splawn told Mr. Drivon he could go up and get them himself is at page 338.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.653" offset="12682553">And I don't think Don Splawn's acquittal means anything because the very large issue in this case was the issue of entrapment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.088" offset="12708258">Mr. Drivon was in constant contact with Don and I think that provides one reason and the general rule is one finds all reasons in favor of a judgment that should apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.818" offset="12763220">As I understand California law, there is a case.I think it's called Sheer versus Municipal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.477" offset="12785894">I'm sorry I do not have the citation, which holds that where a publication has discreet and I use that to mean separate and not in its other meaning -- items, you can look at any one of the items to determine relevant constitutional test or statutory test for obscenity, and if so, the material can be found obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.566" offset="12882233">Sheer ran the Berkeley Barb and that's why I recall that's the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.409" offset="12897593">I could get that citation if you wished.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.515" offset="12906057">Therefore, it would be my view that in the Time Magazine case, if there was one obscene picture or one picture that could -- that had the qualifications which you suggest that might have, the magazine could be found obscene and a Noroff motion wouldn't save it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.934" offset="12975647">I think the Noroff motion -- these cases arrive mostly in the Municipal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.143" offset="12996545">And what happens is that in California, you don't have any preliminary type hearing to get rid of the chase like you would with a felony.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.248" offset="13020891">You don't have a preliminary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.467" offset="13025802">In the Noroff motion, it's frankly a substitute to get rid of the stuff that shouldn't be going to trial at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.743" offset="13054955">Now, I don't think you can characterize this rule fairly, these pandering rules as merely evidence rules, because what they are, they're part now of the definition in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.219" offset="13096856">I will say, however, that under the holding in Marks versus United States, I think that Mr. Splawn will always be entitled to Roth Memoirs standards, and I think for him, they're constitutional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.810" offset="13151190">Hamling is an entirely, as I read what you quoted in Hamling, an entirely different set of instructions which were much fairer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3296.555" offset="13186194">There, the Court said if it's a closed case, look at all of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3300.123" offset="13200405">And didn't say anything about sexual provocativeness, and didn't say anything about the motives of the creator.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.395" offset="13221512">And I will say that while the distinctions between producers and creators may not be significant, the point was that Ginsburg was on trial for behavior that he did, and Hamling was on trial for behavior that he did, and Splawn is on trial for what the creator did, and there's no connection between them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3332.812" offset="13331226">What happened is this was covered in the -- everything was gone through in Chambers, and then there was a general blanket instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.652" offset="13370514">The matter was covered by the Court of Appeals specifically, and I think, therefore, all of these issues are before you because under Jenkins versus Georgia, it hadn't been raised below and the fact that it was considered by the Court was deemed adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.964" offset="13419833">I would leave you with this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.829" offset="13431223">For the very reasons that he suggests that there's evidence of pandering in this record is the very reason why you have to formulate a rule limiting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.973" offset="13463824">This is a case where a policeman had asked four or five times for hardcore material, and then because Mr. Splawn said, “Hey, you know I can get in trouble for this stuff.”</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.245" offset="13500918">That statement is now being used to say that he pandered the material when it was perfectly clear that Drivon wanted the material already, but the sale unaffectedly had been consummated even though the money hadn't changed hands, and what was perfectly obvious that it was a nervous seller who wasn't usually doing this and that what he was doing was just trying to urge the guy not to spread it around.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.422" offset="13585659">It's not evidence of pandering and any set of rules that permits it to be used as such is an unfair set of rules.</text>
