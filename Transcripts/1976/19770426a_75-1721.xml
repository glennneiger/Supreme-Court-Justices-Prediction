            <text syncTime="56.045" offset="324666">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.702" offset="335324">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the First Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.528" offset="346608">The issue is whether a search warrant is required before federal agents may open a locked trunk of footlocker that they properly seized and that they had probable cause to believe it contained contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.063" offset="392688">The District Court suppressed the 200 pounds of marijuana found inside the trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.907" offset="412124">On the government’s appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed with one judge dissenting.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.324" offset="429782">The relevant facts are these: On May 8 about four years ago, May 8, 1973, Amtrack officials told federal agents in San Diego that defendants, Machado and Leary, had loaded a trunk on a train bound for Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.935" offset="492267">They believe the trunk contained marijuana for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.279" offset="505642">First of all, it was leaking talcum powder which is often used to cover the odor of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.129" offset="529048">The trunk had an unusual weight for its size and Machado’s description tallied with a profile used by the railroad to spot drug traffickers.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.858" offset="563947">The federal agents relayed this information to their counterparts in Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.999" offset="580457">I should describe the footlocker.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.864" offset="587980">It was described in the record as old and brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.254" offset="597488">According to Ms. Leary’s suppression motion, it was 2’11” wide, 1’9” high, and 1’8” deep.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.139" offset="1185035">In the car was Mr. Chadwick, he opened the trunk of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.244" offset="1197469">He went into the train station, talked very quickly with Mr. Machado and Ms. Leary, went outside and proceeded to open the trunk of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.764" offset="1235503">With the help of a porter then, Ms. Leary and Mr. Machado accompanying the footlocker took it outside of the train station to Mr. Chadwick’s waiting car.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.102" offset="1280852">Defendant Leary sat down in the car while Mr. Chadwick, Mr. Machado and the porter lifted the footlocker into the car’s trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.097" offset="1340829">When the porter left, the agents moved in.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.429" offset="1362249">All three defendants were arrested.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.121" offset="1368937">The footlocker was seized from the open trunk of the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.039" offset="1380639">It is now 9:10 p.m.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.421" offset="1390148">The agents testified that they decided not to open the footlocker on the spot for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.672" offset="1415121">Number one, it was dark outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.676" offset="1423167">The area was dimly lit.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.525" offset="1430586">Many pedestrians were passing by and there was heavy automobile traffic on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.087" offset="1452842">The three defendants and the footlocker were taken to the agents’ office in Boston about five minutes away from the train station.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.327" offset="1485756">The footlocker was still leaking talcum powder.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.464" offset="1498295">At the office, in the presence of the three defendants, the agents opened the footlocker.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.771" offset="1519611">Inside, as I have said before, they found 200 pounds of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.339" offset="1533822">According to Ms. Leary’s suppression motion, what they actually found were 85 packages each wrapped in blue paper and sealed with a piece of tape and those 85 packages tallied to 200 pounds of marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.570" offset="1594739">The next morning, this is not in the appendix that the court has, the next morning the defendants, all three of them were arraigned before a magistrate on a complaint and an affidavit of the arresting agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.035" offset="1644581">Bail was set, they were bound over and later there was an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.564" offset="1666733">The government in this case, wants to introduce that marijuana and indeed the footlocker itself into evidence at defendants’ trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.163" offset="1701110">The defendants opposed this.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.758" offset="1707484">They opposed the introduction of the marijuana on the basis that the agents should not have opened the footlocker without first getting a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.165" offset="1745100">Our brief advances a number of reasons why we think the opening of the footlocker without a warrant was not an unreasonable search under the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.872" offset="1779999">As a preliminary matter, I ought to say that our purpose in advancing these arguments is to try to provide a coherent analysis to guide the decision in these kinds of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.426" offset="1826184">The Courts of Appeals and the Court will notice from my brief, have dealt with this type of situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.711" offset="1851366">Moveable objects found outside the home in countless cases, the results, we think generally support the government’s position in this case, although the rationale is sometimes difficult to discern, I might point out that, in fact respondents in their brief not sited a single lower court decision in their favor.</text>

            <text syncTime="500.669" offset="2103186">I might point out that the factual patterns in all these cases are endless of course and to make our position clear, in this case alone, for example, after the agents had probable cause, Mr. Machado, for instance, could have been arrested and the footlocker seized while he was sitting on it in the train station or while he was moving it out to the car or while Mr. Chadwick’s car was pulling away with the footlocker in the trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.260" offset="2197541">Under our view of the case, the search without a warrant in all these situations would be reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, not unreasonable and so we draw on distinction between this.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.900" offset="2248114">We do not think they are constitutional distinctions and let me explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.522" offset="2274550">First of all, this is not strictly a search and seizure case.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.162" offset="2293149">The sequence is reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="553.057" offset="2312688">Like the cases dealing with automobiles and unlike the cases dealing with hounds or houses, the seizure came first here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1685.154" offset="6841067">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.209" offset="6865309">The government on three separate occasions, twice at the District Court and once at the Circuit Court, has tried to persuade the Courts that this search falls within the established standards, the presumptive requirement of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.591" offset="6918808">They have explicitly conceded today that it does not and it has asked this Court to use this case as a vehicle to make major incursions into the warrant clause of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.317" offset="6961753">There is a coherent standard which prevails on even warrantless searches and that is the Katz standard, the expectation of privacy standard and by admitting that no existing exception to the search warrant, justifies this search as the law now stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.906" offset="7024133">There are tremendous consequences towards an individual’s expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.735" offset="7043464">Here, there was a seizure as there are frequently in automobile cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.801" offset="7063735">Ipso facto, the government says you can therefore search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.199" offset="7077319">Well, it is the position of the defendants that there was a constitutional distinction of great importance between an automobile and a footlocker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.759" offset="7111487">With a footlocker, a briefcase, and a trunk, and all kinds of other containers which, unlike a car, are often a repository for private property which unlike a car are not constantly the subject of non-criminal investigations of contact with the police, with regulations, with inspection, with motor vehicle laws, with all he various indicia which this Court in the Cady Case and in the Opperman Case have said reduces one’s expectation of privacy in an automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.713" offset="7243353">That the government has conceded and as those cases state that the mobility of a vehicle, like the arguable mobility of a trunk, has grounds for seizure, it is grounds for immobilization of the property, but the Court has stated and the government concedes in their brief on page 35 that mobility in and of itself is not a justification for a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.218" offset="7329348">The justification for the search following the seizure in the automobile cases is the reduced expectation of privacy which an individual has in a vehicle, particularly following the decisions of this Court in Cady and in Opperman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.077" offset="7384832">Those justifications for the reduced expectation of privacy in automobile are not present in the case with the footlocker or not present in the case of a brief case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1831.829" offset="7427777">Mr. Weinberg, let me ask you the same question I asked Mr. Randolph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.595" offset="7442824">You say the reduced expectations of privacy are not present after Cady and Opperman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.596" offset="7466857">Well, if we decide this case against you and the next case against your counterpart, presumably there will be reduced expectations of privacy in footlockers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.383" offset="7501965">That is kind of a self-fulfilling prophecy, however you argue it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Martin G. Weinberg</label>
            <text syncTime="1853.996" offset="7516489">But it is true that if this Court did in fact make that decision, that the citizens would, from here on and have a reduced expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.246" offset="7553479">The real question is, whether or not the constitutional standards of the Fourth Amendment justify a decision which in fact reduces the expectation of privacy and we would state that the entire body of jurisprudence starting with ex party Jackson, through Katz, the US v. Van Leeuwen, does not justify that kind of decision, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1899.733" offset="7699451">If I was arguing those cases, I would make the same argument, but henceforth that argument cannot be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.329" offset="7721812">There were distinctions why this Court found a lesser expectation of privacy in the automobile.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.652" offset="7747098">What I am suggesting is those distinctions which justify the automobile cases are not present in this case and that I would argue that this Court should not establish a lesser expectation of privacy in a brief case, in a footlocker trunk, in luggage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1954.494" offset="7918462">They very explicitly state that sealed packages, mail, letters can be taken out of the home wherever they maybe found, people have the justification of privacy and the right to the protection of the warrant clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="3574.297" offset="14397665">It sounds very precise, just notable perceptions, but then when you start thinking about it, he makes a distinction between whether the footlocker was weighed 2 pounds or 20 pounds, or even if Mr. Machado was a defensive lineman for a pro football team and had it under his arm as he walked out, it would make a difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3600.012" offset="14500483">These kinds of fine-line distinctions, we think do a couple things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.328" offset="14513753">One, they lead to a lot of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.484" offset="14522426">Second, they do not give the police any real guidance because they are not analytical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.762" offset="14539562">I cannot see the line between those events and I think the Court would have difficulty doing so as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3614.721" offset="14559415">We think not only that, but finally, maybe this is the most important thing, they take away the importance and the seriousness of the warrant requirement because they burden the warrant system with these kinds of cases and I think that may not help to instill the kind of responsibility that we want to instill in magistrates, when they are dealing with very serious intrusions where the Court has held a warrant is required in the home, in the office, and private communications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.667" offset="14663173">For that reason, we urge the decision of the Court to be reversed.</text>
