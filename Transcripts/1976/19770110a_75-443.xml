            <text syncTime="12.324" offset="152639">Mrs. Silverman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Ms. Arlene R. Silverman</label>
            <text syncTime="24.648" offset="201958">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.429" offset="213138">Appellants appeal from an order of a three judge District Court in the Southern District of New York which enjoined the operation of Section 6811 (8) of the New York State Education Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.460" offset="257233">This law did three things and we are talking here only in the context of non-prescription contraceptives as opposed to prescription contraceptives.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.923" offset="295058">The first thing this law did was to limit the sale of contraceptives by licensed pharmacists only in the context of those 16 years and older.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.259" offset="332361">It also forbade the sale by pharmacists to children under 16 and the statutory scheme provides that these particular individuals have to attain their non-prescription contraceptives from a physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.700" offset="382203">This is provided by Section 6807 1(b) of the Education Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.604" offset="401742">Finally, the statutory scheme prescribed the advertisement and display of contraceptive products.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.139" offset="439881">Before turning to the merits of Appellees' claims, I would just like briefly to address myself to the question of standing of the different appellees to maintain this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.235" offset="484289">The District Court held that population planning associates and Hagen had standing to raise the First Amendment and privacy rights of users of non-prescription contraceptives, we disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.906" offset="534967">As per plaintiff, population planning associates as well as Hagen, it is our position that there is no realistic -- or that they have demonstrated no realistic fear of prosecution under the statute that is currently being attacked.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.171" offset="592018">As we have pointed out, there have been no prosecutions under the Statute of New York State since 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.981" offset="623261">We feel that this is even recognized by population planning associates itself since -- although they received two letters from the State Board of Pharmacy with regards to the advertisement of contraceptives.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.761" offset="670386">They waited over a year before even initiating this lawsuit in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.544" offset="693582">Although, there was a visit to their premises in September, 1974 after this lawsuit was started.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.023" offset="723466">This visit was for information gathering purposes only, and is not sufficient to confer standing on population planning associates.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.277" offset="760456">As for the Reverent Hagen, there is not even an allegation in the complaint that he received a letter, and we would say that he also is without standing and without standing even less than population planning associates to maintain this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.825" offset="830673">Even if appellees had demonstrated a realistic fear of injury under the Statute, we also feel they are not suitable representatives to raise the privacy rights of third parties which is what they are both attempting to do in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.881" offset="894934">A Plaintiff Population Associates is a commercial firm and under these circumstances, we feel they are not a proper party to raise the privacy rights of users of non-prescription contraceptives where there is no party to a lawsuit and never was a party to the lawsuit who maintained that they wanted these particular products sold in places other than licensed pharmacies.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.967" offset="1003290">With respect, Plaintiff Population Planning associates raising the First Amendment rights of others, we also feel they're an improper party. The District Court in holding that they had standing to raise the First Amendment rights of others, relied on the Procunier and the New York Times cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.472" offset="1069223">We feel that neither of these cases support that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.721" offset="1082284">Procunier was not an assertion of third party rights case.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.853" offset="1098794">The court in that case was careful to state that we do not deal here with the difficult questions of the so called right to hear and third party standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.064" offset="1139649">But with the particular means of communication which the interest of both parties are inextricably mashed, that's in Procunier at page 409.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.248" offset="1176325">As for the New York Times case, we would submit that those are very special kinds of standing cases because in that type of case, a third party is not permitted to raise the rights of those who would receive the communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.984" offset="1231287">The receivers of the communication not knowing about the communication would of course be in no position to bring the lawsuit themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.720" offset="1258245">That is quite different from the case here where there is a statute on the book, and those who would benefit from appellees argument in this court, would be in a position to attack the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.559" offset="1313625">As for Hagen, he does not allege any interference with his receipt of information regarding contraceptives, nor does he allege that he wishes to advertise or display contraceptives and for these reasons, we would also feel he is not an appropriate party to raise the third party interest -- to raise third party interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.915" offset="1398993">There were other plaintiffs in the District Court, the District Court did not reach the question of their standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.664" offset="1426056">We would submit that they in any event do not have any standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.014" offset="1439431">The doctors as we have pointed out are exempted from the operation of Section 6811 (a) by another provision of the Education Law, PSILH, no threat of prosecution, and as the District Court pointed out, their exact relationship to the New York State Law was not at all clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.973" offset="1515290">As for John Doe(ph), he was never identified and we would submit that an analysis of the complaint would indicate that his claims in any event are speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.909" offset="1567013">Turning out to an analysis of the merits of the claims advanced by the plaintiffs in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.871" offset="1602853">The District Court analyzed the New York Statutory scheme from a right of privacy standpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.240" offset="1632319">They held that the right of private – that access to contraceptive products was, if not an aspect of the right of privacy was close enough for them to consider it as such.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.842" offset="1678712">And they therefore found that the State could not regulate in this area unless there was a fundamental reason for it to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.409" offset="1725001">It is our position however that in reaching this conclusion, the District Court applied an inappropriate standard to the New York State Statutory Scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.605" offset="1765752">There is no right of access to contraceptive products even assuming there is a right to use contraceptive products which was the case in Griswold v. Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.991" offset="1803368">New York in providing, that only licensed pharmacist or physicians where children under 16 are concerned may distribute contraceptives has merely regulated the sources from which individuals may obtain contraceptives.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.984" offset="1863346">I thought that it was illegal for a pharmacist to sell contraceptives to those under 16.</text>

            <text syncTime="447.742" offset="1894379">I thought -- and I just said that, New York in providing that licensed pharmacists or physicians where children under 16 are concerned, that is true, may only sell contraceptive -- only physicians may distribute contraceptives.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.065" offset="1991659">They would have to obtain non-prescription contraceptives from a clinic where a physician is employed or works or from a physician directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.171" offset="2032097">However, there are no individuals in New York State that are denied outright the ability to obtain non-prescription contraceptive products.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.043" offset="2067519">Thus, the statutory scheme under attack here --</text>

            <text syncTime="496.465" offset="2089253">Well, because under the New York State statutory scheme, adults could go into a pharmacist and from him, they could purchase non-prescription contraceptives and a child under the age of 16 could go to a clinic or to a physician and would be able to obtain non-prescription contraceptives.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.761" offset="2158425">So there was no category of individuals in the State of New York that does not have some means of obtaining non-prescription contraceptives.</text>

            <text syncTime="773.182" offset="3196113">Well, it makes it -- the statute makes it illegal for anybody to give or sell the contraceptive to anybody whether it be parent or child or whatever --unless he is a distributor, seller or a pharmacist or a physician.</text>

            <text syncTime="786.633" offset="3249925">Yes, I would agree Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.335" offset="3260688">In any event, since as we have just been discussing, since contraceptives are available to all in the State of New York, we would say that the claims raised here by the appellees do not reach the level of governmental intrusion into matter, so affecting the decision whether to bear -- to get a child, and therefore, we would say that the issue before this court is not one involving the right to use contraceptive products, but is merely a state statute which tends to regulate the sale of contraceptive products, and does not establish any independent constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.209" offset="3416168">I believe that this was pointed out by this court in Griswold v. Connecticut where this court held that the statutory scheme, an issue in that case was violative of the constitution because it forbade the use of contraceptives.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.611" offset="3473847">The court specifically noted at Page 485 that the statutory scheme did not simply regulate manufacture or sell, which is the case with this particular statute of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.217" offset="3532257">In short, then we would simply state that the right of the access to contraceptive products is not a right within the right of privacy, is not a right within the constitution, and therefore, the District Court in invalidating the statutory scheme implied an inappropriate and unwarranted constitutional standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="880.011" offset="3623372">We would point out however, that even if they were right in applying this particular standard, that the reasons for the statutory scheme are such that the regulation is permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.459" offset="3677184">I would just at this point though like to note with respect to the claim that only licensed pharmacists may distribute non-prescription contraceptives that we feel that this is an argument that cannot really be taken seriously by this court, since there are many pharmacies in New York and it does not seem to the appellants that this really raises a realistic claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.608" offset="3765791">There is no proof in the record, and we do not believe it could seriously be shown by the appellees that an individual in New York state could not obtain non prescription contraceptives if they did not want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="928.383" offset="3816887">There are many, many pharmacies in New York and to us, it seems a highly specious argument to claim that there was not a supply of these contraceptives or that they are unavailable to particular individuals wishing to purchase them.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.500" offset="3873416">In any event we would submit further that the limitations on sale which permit only licensed pharmacists to sell non prescription contraceptives is eminently reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="1065.057" offset="4363577">Well, we justify it on various grounds Your Honor, one of them is that permitting a licensed pharmacist to sell these products does permit an area of expertise to be developed at least whereby he would have some idea of what particular product might be best suited for some particular individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.285" offset="4432541">And with his training, would be a in better position than the average individual to answer any questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.354" offset="4460753">Since presumably a pharmacist would have been to a specialized school and would have a background in chemicals etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.521" offset="4489488">We feel there are other justifications however by limiting the sale by licensed pharmacist, this prohibits anyone or prevents rather anyone from tampering with the items and also, if the statutory scheme which forbids display of contraceptives and limits the sale by minors to physicians only, since the State Board of Pharmacy employees investigators, these provisions are capable of realistic enforcement if contraceptives result anywhere, of course there would be no way really to enforce these particular provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.632" offset="4637863">The appellees raise an argument in this court which they mentioned briefly in their complaint, but didn’t pursue thereafter and I took it as abandoned -- that the fact that these products are limited, that only licensed pharmacists may sell these products keeps the prices of the products artificially high.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.340" offset="4708707">We would submit that there is no proof in the record of that particular point, but even if there were that, that in and of itself is not a reason to overturn the statutory scheme.</text>

            <text syncTime="1167.537" offset="4773491">As for the limitation on the way, minors under the age of 16 may obtain non prescription contraceptives, we would also submit that even if there is a right of access to contraceptive products, that the New York statutory scheme is again constitutional that the reason the legislature has advanced for this particular statutory scheme is the morality of the youth of the state of New York and we would submit that the morality of the youth of the state of New York wants this particular legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.582" offset="4897729">We have cited in our brief various studies and statical analysis which we feel support the position that even if not non prescription contraceptives were more widely available, youngsters 13, 14, 12, 11 whatever age they are like would not use them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.390" offset="4960946">However, by making them widely available, we would in effect be sanctioning sexual activity by these particular groups of youngsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.694" offset="4994173">Under these circumstances we feel it was reasonable for the state legislature to determine that permitting youngsters to obtain these products from a physician was in the best interest of these youngsters and was consistent with the morality, the standards of morality of the state.</text>
