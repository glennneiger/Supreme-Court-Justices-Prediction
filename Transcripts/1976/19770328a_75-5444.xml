            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100862">We will hear arguments first this morning in 75-5444, Coker v. Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.498" offset="142762">Mr. Kendall, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_e_kendall" startTime="19.347" stopTime="353.690">
            <label>Mr. David E. Kendall</label>
            <text syncTime="19.347" offset="178184">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.360" offset="190201">I am David Kendall and I represent petitioner Erlich Anthony Coker who has been condemned by the State of Georgia to be electrocuted for the crime of rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.075" offset="233146">This case presents for review a question explicitly reserved in last term’s Gregg v. Georgia decision: whether the taking of a criminal’s life is a proportionate sanction where no victim has been deprived of life, for example, when capital punishment has been imposed for rape that does not result in the death of any human being.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.016" offset="324888">Now, on September 2, 1974, petitioner Coker was incarcerated for murder, rape, kidnapping and aggravated assault at the Ware Correctional Institution in Southern Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.370" offset="378282">During an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting he was attending that night, a group of prisoners seized two guards and in the ensuing disturbance, petitioner Coker escaped through the roof of the building the meeting was being held in.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.402" offset="434393">At about 11 pm that evening, petitioner appeared at the home of Allen and Alita Carver in nearby Waycross, Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.804" offset="468039">Brandishing a board, he had Allan Carver tied up in the bathroom and moved the Carvers’ three-weeks old sleeping baby in the bassinette into the bathroom with Carver.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.602" offset="519239">He secured a kitchen knife with a four-inch blade and took $20.30 from Allan Carter’s billfold which was lying on a dresser.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.921" offset="556542">He had Mrs. Carver change into her street clothes in order to show him how to start the family car.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.550" offset="587053">After she had undressed, he raped her and then clothed himself in Allan Carver’s clothes.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.652" offset="611399">During the rape, the knife lay on a nearby dresser, within petitioner’s reach.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.068" offset="633133">He told Allan Carver that he was taking Mrs. Carver with him and that he would release her unharmed, but if stopped by the police, he would kill her.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.549" offset="675033">After they left, Allan Carver was able to free himself and call the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.424" offset="694469">Within the hour, the police arrested petitioner, who had parked with Mrs. Carver on a dirt road to evade a police road block.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.397" offset="726442">Mrs. Carver was released, nervous, shaken but physically unharmed apart from the rape itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.646" offset="755386">A counsel was appointed to represent petitioner and he was subsequently indicted for rape, armed robbery, kidnapping, motor vehicle theft and escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.530" offset="798958">A special plea of insanity was filed which, under Georgia law, sets up present competence to be tried and on November 19th, 1974, the jury returned a verdict finding petitioner competent.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.749" offset="851830">Now, the case was tried on all five counts of the indictment under the procedures that this Court has reviewed in Gregg v. Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.687" offset="883595">At the conclusion of the first stage of the trial, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on all five counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.658" offset="911494">At the second stage, a proceeding was then held to determine sentence on the two punitive capital counts of the indictment, the rape and the armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.545" offset="950991">Now, at this point the State introduced evidence of petitioner’s prior capital felony convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.518" offset="978890">This record consisted of three two-count indictments involving crimes against two victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.750" offset="1007833">With one Philip Ecoles, petitioner had been convicted in the Clayton County Superior Court for the December 5th, 1971 murder of one Sue Ann Wick, the rape and murder of Sue Ann Wick, and had received consecutive sentences of life imprisonment and twenty years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.736" offset="1087768">With one Glen Harlen Stacey, he had been convicted after trial in the Richmond County Superior Court for the July 29, 1972 rape and kidnapping of one Susan Laureen Jones and for these crimes he received consecutive sentences of life imprisonment and twenty years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.391" offset="1170420">Finally, petitioner had pleaded guilty in the Tolliver County Superior Court to another July 29, 1972 rape of Susan Laureen Jones for which he received a sentence of life imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.687" offset="1227575">The State introduced the indictment and the sentences for these crimes and presented witnesses who identified petitioner as the person named in these indictments and sentences, but details of these prior convictions or the factual circumstances of the prior convictions were not adduced.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.826" offset="1296121">Petitioner presented no evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.214" offset="1305629">The trial court instructed the jury that as to the rape conviction, it could find two aggravating circumstances, which under the Georgia statute, justify the imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.615" offset="1355262">The court instructed that the jury could find that the rape was committed by a person with a prior capital felony conviction and it instructed that the jury could find the rape committed by a person during the commission of another capital felony, to wit, the armed robbery of $20.30 from Allan Carver.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.494" offset="1450766">Now, the trial court did not define particular mitigating circumstances because none are defined in the statute, but it did instruct that in litigation, the jury could recognize anything which in fairness or mercy could justify extenuation of the degree of punishment.</text>

          <turn speaker="warren_e_burger" startTime="353.690" stopTime="358.280">
            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="353.690" offset="1515549">Do you suggest there are some extenuating circumstances here on this record?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_e_kendall" startTime="358.280" stopTime="472.942">
            <label>Mr. David E. Kendall</label>
            <text syncTime="358.280" offset="1533940">Well, Mr. Chief Justice, we believe that the evidence of petitioner’s sanity, insanity, of his alcoholism do indeed constitute mitigating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.017" offset="1588901">Those have been presented to the jury at the first stage of the trial, this was essentially a trifercated trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.706" offset="1611680">There was a trial on the issue of sanity which preceded the trial of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.193" offset="1645535">The jury found both aggravating circumstances to exist beyond the reasonable doubt and sentenced petitioner to be electrocuted for the rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.264" offset="1677822">It imposed a sentence of life imprisonment for the armed robbery conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.173" offset="1693495">An appeal was subsequently taken to the Georgia Supreme Court and that court, with one justice dissenting, affirmed petitioner’s sentences and convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.276" offset="1737904">A certiorari petition was subsequently filed in this Court and on October 4th of last year, the Court granted certiorari limited to the single question whether the death penalty may be constitutionally exacted for a rape where the life of a victim is not taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.243" offset="1813763">While the court’s decision is of literally vital significance to Erlich Coker, it will not have much of an impact on the criminal justice system, whichever way the Court decides this case because the death penalty for non-homicide crimes has been almost totally repudiated by this society, in fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.028" offset="1896937">Of the 345 people who are now on death row in this country, six are on death row for non-homicide crimes or crimes that do not involve the death of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.607" offset="1947197">Georgia is the only American state and virtually the only jurisdiction in the civilized world that now authorizes the death penalty for the rape of an adult woman.</text>

            <label>Mr. David E. Kendall</label>

          <turn speaker="david_e_kendall" startTime="482.247" stopTime="497.720">
            <label>Mr. David E. Kendall</label>
            <text syncTime="482.247" offset="2029848">For kidnapping, when the victim is harmed or ransom secured, it authorizes the death penalty for six capital offenses after Gregg.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.522" offset="2066942">It also authorizes the death penalty for treason, for murder and for aircraft hijacking.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="497.720" offset="2091706">So in non-homicide cases, the death penalty can be imposed for five different offenses under Georgia law?</text>

            <label>Mr. David E. Kendall</label>
            <text syncTime="506.300" offset="2125979">Four, because the Georgia Supreme Court in the Gregg case held that the death penalty could not be constitutionally imposed for armed robbery.</text>

          <turn speaker="potter_stewart" startTime="514.926" stopTime="515.881">

          <turn speaker="david_e_kendall" startTime="515.881" stopTime="531.227">
            <label>Mr. David E. Kendall</label>
            <text syncTime="515.881" offset="2164326">Despite the statute, it was a statutory holding, it was not a constitutional holding.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.674" offset="2179478">Indeed, after Furman v. Georgia, the states enacted 16 non-homicide death penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.241" offset="2217825">Georgia enacted five of those.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="531.227" offset="2225766">You said the Georgia Supreme Court’s ruling that death could not be imposed for armed robbery was a statutory ruling?</text>

            <label>Mr. David E. Kendall</label>
            <text syncTime="539.362" offset="2258263">Yes, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.009" offset="2264846">There is a cruel and unusual punishments clause in the Georgia Constitution, but that clause was not relied on in the Gregg case.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.105" offset="2293267">There is a provision for review of a sentence that is disproportionate or excessive and the Georgia Supreme Court held that a death penalty for armed robbery was such an illegal sentence.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="560.096" stopTime="566.680">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="560.096" offset="2341228">Was it the holding that would apply to all future convictions for armed robbery?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_e_kendall" startTime="566.680" stopTime="870.317">
            <label>Mr. David E. Kendall</label>
            <text syncTime="566.680" offset="2367559">Yes, yes it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.882" offset="2372366">The Court has vacated since that time two other death sentences for armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.894" offset="2388353">In each case an armed robbery death sentence has been imposed, it has been imposed with a murder death sentence, so just one death sentence was vacated of each defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.850" offset="2432238">Even in Georgia, only a small arbitrarily selected fraction of eligible defendants are condemned for rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.124" offset="2473303">Finally, the death penalty for rape comes to this Court with a notorious and unsavory reputation for racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.117" offset="2509247">Now, petitioner Coker is white and the Court did not grant an equal protection claim in this case, but part of our Eighth Amendment submission on behalf of petitioner Coker is that the origin of the death penalty for rape and such continuing acceptance as it demonstrates is really founded in invidious racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.975" offset="2596705">Ninety percent of the people executed for this crime, the 455 people executed for this crime since 1930, have been black.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.183" offset="2629515">In Georgia itself in this period, 58 blacks have been executed and three whites have been executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.119" offset="2661280">Now, our submission on behalf of petitioner Coker is essentially two-fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.471" offset="2682700">First, that the death penalty for rape constitutes an excessive and disproportionate punishment for a crime where the life of the victim has not been taken when judged by relevant contemporary standards and second, quite apart from this first claim, that the present pattern of imposition of the death penalty for rape in Georgia shows the same arbitrariness, infrequency and capriciousness of application that this Court held violated the Eighth Amendment in Furman v. Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.080" offset="2813104">Now, that punishment should somehow be proportioned to the offense was first recognized by this Court in Weems v. United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.436" offset="2846540">It was again recognized in last July’s capital punishment decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.053" offset="2872976">In those cases, the Court held that the death penalty for homicides intentionally committed by a defendant did not violate the Eighth Amendment, was not a disproportionate sanction, but the Court reserved the constitutionality of a death penalty where the life of the victim was not taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.527" offset="2938909">Now, certainly rape is a serious offense like aggravated assault, maim, child torture, aggravated sodomy or attempted murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.410" offset="2974436">The question here, however, is whether rape will be punished by the ultimate penalty that the criminal justice system can dispense.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.743" offset="3003798">In Woodson, the plurality recognized that the death penalty is different in kind from a sentence of imprisonment, however long.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.823" offset="3036085">It said that death is qualitatively different from imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.404" offset="3054475">Last Tuesday, the plurality in Gardner v. Florida stated that the death penalty is different from imprisonment in both severity and finality, that it differs dramatically from any other legitimate state action and the question posed here is not whether rape will be stringently punished.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.106" offset="3129185">Indeed, Georgia authorizes a sentence of life imprisonment for rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.009" offset="3144859">The question is really whether it could be punished by the unique and irreversible punishment of death.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.512" offset="3166906">Now in the Gregg plurality opinion, the Court stated that in applying the proportionality test, the Court would not look to subjective standards, but would instead look to what it called objective indicia of contemporary attitudes towards a given sanction.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.523" offset="3238900">It recognized three of these objective indicia: legislative enactments, jury verdicts and what the Court called history and traditional usage.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.601" offset="3287174">We submit by the unanimous concurrence of these indicators, the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment today.</text>
            <text syncTime="804.289" offset="3317998">Now, as far as legislative enactments go, as I have mentioned, Georgia Code annotated 26-2001 is literally unique in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.279" offset="3361884">No other American jurisdiction now authorizes the death penalty for the rape of an adult woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.899" offset="3388424">In 1926, there were 20 United States jurisdictions that authorized a discretionary death penalty for the rape of an adult woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="832.161" offset="3429489">Even before this court’s decision in Furman v. Georgia, there was a trend toward abolition.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.342" offset="3450178">Delaware abolished the penalty in 1958.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.223" offset="3461672">West Virginia abolished it in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.090" offset="3473166">The District of Columbia abolished it in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.650" offset="3487376">On the eve of Furman, therefore, 17 states had a discretionary death penalty for the rape of an adult woman.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.038" offset="3512976">The 11 states of the Confederacy, four border states; Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Oklahoma, plus Nevada where there was severe bodily injury and the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.206" offset="3561669">Now, Furman wiped these statutes off the books because all were discretionary.</text>

            <text syncTime="883.453" offset="3634602">Well, I submit that the court’s Furman decision does reflect the desuetude into which the death penalty had fallen in many cases, both murder and rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.002" offset="3672846">We really, as an indicator of contemporary standards, rely on the legislative reaction to Furman, and to Gregg for that matter because when the legislatures had to take another look at the crime of rape, only six states enacted any kind of death penalty for a rape offense after Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.269" offset="3741913">Now, three of these states; Tennessee, Florida and Mississippi enacted a death penalty for the rape of a child under 12 or in the case of Florida, under 11.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.839" offset="3784127">North Carolina and Louisiana enacted a very narrow death penalty, mandatory death penalty for the rape of an adult woman where there was serious bodily injury or where a weapon was used.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.625" offset="3827282">Only Georgia enacted a death penalty that would punish any rape of an adult woman with death.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.101" offset="3853195">So we think that the reaction to Furman does manifest that legislative repudiation and indeed, there is a further reaction because, since Gregg, this court’s decisions in Roberts and Woodson had the effect of invalidating mandatory death penalty statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="954.864" offset="3920278">So that invalidated Tennessee’s death penalty statute, Louisiana’s, North Carolina’s and Mississippi’s.</text>

            <text syncTime="968.550" offset="3975030">Well, I think probably with those states, it is too short to be sure, but we do know that for example, Louisiana has enacted within a month of this court’s Roberts decision, enacted a death penalty for homicide, for certain kinds of homicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.418" offset="4030514">It defeated a death penalty for aggravated rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.660" offset="4043471">So I think that Louisiana, we can check off.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.775" offset="4059876">Tennessee, the only other legislative activity that I am aware of is in the state of Tennessee where a death penalty for homicide has cleared the judiciary committees of both houses and the death penalty for rape bills have been defeated within those committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.469" offset="4114733">So I am not suggesting that there is enough time since Gregg to fully assess it, but we do know that there have been four death penalties for homicide statutes passed since Gregg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.016" offset="4152872">None of those states have enacted a death penalty for rape and there are three other states which we note in our reply brief where both houses of the legislature have enacted a death penalty bill for homicide and those are awaiting the governor’s signature in Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia and the houses of legislature have not enacted a death penalty for rape.</text>

            <text syncTime="1318.425" offset="5374462">But insofar as deterrence is a question that relates to the general public, I think the usual safeguards that can be applied to prevent escapes would adequately protect the public, because it is interesting that in both the Coker and the Coley case, which are two, the Coley case is very similar to this case in many ways.</text>

            <text syncTime="1424.192" offset="5797541">In fact, its proportionality review consisted entirely in the statement that the death penalty here is not excessive or disproportionate.</text>

            <text syncTime="1467.228" offset="5969740">Well, the only study I know of is a study by Professor Bailey that appears in the 1976 book, Capital Punishment in the United States, he did a regression analysis which indicated that (a) rape rates in abolition states were lower than in retentionist states and also that the death penalty, its execution in retentionist states bore no inverse relation to the rape rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1494.235" offset="6077783">That would suggest that there is no deterrent effect of the death penalty, but Bailey also I think in fairness, observed that the death penalty was simply too sporadically imposed to really run a good regression analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.860" offset="6124281">It is very seldom imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.246" offset="6129819">It also constituted no threat, he said, to the white rapist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.257" offset="6145806">So, he did no really say that his study was at all conclusive, but the data is so bad that it is difficult to get a conclusory study.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.881" offset="6184362">So I mentioned that petitioner with Messrs, Hooks, Ebrahart, Shue, Hughs and Boyer are the members of an exclusive, but hapless fraternity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.117" offset="6233264">They are the only people now on death row.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.622" offset="6243295">There are a couple of ways to measure their uniqueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.153" offset="6253430">First of all, the uniform crime reports indicate that about 1200 forcible rapes occur every year in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.930" offset="6284568">That would be about 4800 rape offenses committed under the new statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.061" offset="6305048">The other thing, as we point in our brief and reply brief, is that the Georgia Supreme Court has reviewed 59 cases in which life or less has been imposed as a punishment for a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1561.877" offset="6348307">Not all rape convictions certainly were appealed to the Georgia Supreme Court, but we do know that at least 59 non-capital rapes have been reviewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.627" offset="6387282">I think I have said enough to indicate what our Furman submission is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.623" offset="6403269">It is simply that without reaching the question whether the death penalty is disproportionate for the crime of rape, the pattern of imposition here is precisely that observed in Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.597" offset="6447154">The death penalty is an extraordinarily rare punishment for the crime of rape.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.536" offset="6646939">Secondly, we submit that condemning death for rape under any and all circumstances would have far-reaching consequences over and beyond this particular case, and over and beyond the question vis-à-vis rape, that is, capital punishment vis-à-vis rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.250" offset="6733770">Our third point that we would wish to stress is recidivism and violent crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.198" offset="6781626">The Court has noted that the wisdom of capital punishment is generally a matter for the legislative forum.</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.581" offset="6855082">We submit that this reflects the wisdom of the framers of the Constitution and that the legislative judgment is bound primarily in this area by the Eighth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1708.435" offset="6934599">Now, the Court in the Gregg series of opinions has held that death for murder is not unconstitutional regardless of the offense, regardless of the offender and regardless of the procedure involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.544" offset="7010981">It is difficult for us to fathom how a constitutional distinction can be drawn between rape and murder.</text>

            <text syncTime="1821.466" offset="7386726">The point that I wish to draw in terms of murder and rape is that the statutes are not designed to execute all murderers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1843.958" offset="7476692">The point is that some rapes can be viewed, not only can be but are viewed, by society just as serious and calling for severe sanctions, just as many murders are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.312" offset="7578047">In fact some rapes, depending on the circumstances of the offense, the character of the offender, would call for more public condonation than many murders, based on the fact that many, many murders occur among friends, amongst family members and rape of course seldom involves that situation, not to say that it does not occur, but it is generally a situation where the victim is a stranger to the offender.</text>

            <text syncTime="2837.097" offset="11449185">As I have read the plurality in Gregg, there must be a two-step process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2846.310" offset="11486070">First is the crime served or does the punishment serve any legitimate government interest, not necessarily that this would be the best punishment and number two, is it disproportionate and if the impact is to say that capital punishment is unconstitutional if a life is not taken, it reverts us to a contemporary form of the eye-for-an-eye, for instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.711" offset="11691706">We submit that society should not be relegated to such a simplistic formula that in many instances, the need to deter such crimes that would go to the very foundation of your government would be the sufficient justification to promote the taking of a life when none has in fact been taken, that is none have been taken directly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2951.564" offset="11907060">It means that a person can commit murder with impunity if one wants to put it that way, after committing a rape, an assailant could think, well I might as well kill the victim because the punishment would be no greater, am I correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="2975.724" offset="12003713">I think the logic behind that question would perhaps be sound if we had a mandatory system where the offender would be executed just for committing the rape, would absolutely be executed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2995.567" offset="12083125">Well, in the mandatory systems that Woodson in effect, threw out, that point would have more validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.118" offset="12121264">In the discretionary system, I do not feel that it has much validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.407" offset="12146446">Number one, our statute gives the rapist the incentive not to harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.719" offset="12187719">If he does murder, the likelihood of the chances that he will receive a death verdict are increased tremendously and if the fear of capital punishment deters in the sense of saving victims’ lives, we submit that it would also have a fall-down effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.649" offset="12319376">In other words, that if life taking is deterred that the tendency to harm the victim would also be deterred somewhat, such as the armed robber who goes into the convenience store for the stick-up, he would be deterred from taking a gun perhaps into the store, fearing that he would commit murder in the course of the armed robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.346" offset="12414149">If he chooses not to take his gun into the store, perhaps he will not even commit the armed robbery at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.293" offset="12449989">Therefore, in our system, the incentive is not to harm your rape victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.174" offset="12473499">If you do, that still does not mean that you will be executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.740" offset="12527729">Our third point is recidivism and violent crime and I have touched on that briefly before and the question is simply what is society to do with the incorrigible recidivist who has not only demonstrated that he will rape again, but also demonstrated that he will likely kill or seriously injure those whom he rapes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3133.333" offset="12634100">Now, the petitioner has stated that he was not tried under a recidivist theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.509" offset="12670880">Well, we disagree with that completely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.062" offset="12689061">First, the aggravating circumstance under which he was found guilty that we noted before is the prior conviction of a capital felony and we submit that that is the basis for such an aggravating circumstance or that the theory underlying that specific aggravating circumstance is specific deterrence that is to deter, to preclude that particular individual from committing further violent crimes to incapacitate that particular criminal and that has been recognized in many of the so-called mandatory statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.334" offset="12858126">In fact in Texas, it is required that it be determined that the offender will likely engage in further serious violent crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.428" offset="12906504">That was the basis of this aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3206.677" offset="12927507">It was relied on heavily by the state and we submit that was the primary basis upon which he was tried as a recidivist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.287" offset="12981946">When we look at the specific crimes involved here, we see three prior rapes, two pertaining to the same victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3234.514" offset="13038893">One victim was severely injured.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.675" offset="13059478">The other victim was killed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.030" offset="13068882">Now, the particular victim in this case was not harmed over and beyond the rape itself, but we submit that, to deter those who demonstrate their recidivism such as this petitioner, the question of the constitutionality of punishing death for rape should not hinge on the fact that he did not harm his most recent victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.475" offset="13186746">In fact, the quickness with which he was apprehended perhaps saved this victim from a fate similar to her predecessors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3339.409" offset="13458420">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, just a few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.813" offset="13480049">The need to protect society really has more than one facet and I commend to the court’s attention the Amicus Curiae brief filed by a number of women’s rights organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.441" offset="13530622">They make the point that, for their constituents, the death penalty for rape is counter-productive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.609" offset="13555282">It discourages prosecutions, may lead to jury nullification and gives the criminal in a state where homicide is punishable by death an incentive to kill the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.372" offset="13598331">So as far as they are concerned, I do not think anybody can tax them with insensitivity to rape victims, the death penalty for rape is counter-productive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.553" offset="13635007">Now, the second thing that I would like to say is about the use of the death penalty for other crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3389.612" offset="13659249">As I pointed out earlier, in the four years since Furman, nobody has been condemned to die for some non-homicide and only six people have been condemned to die for rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="3401.931" offset="13708568">I think this underlines the wisdom of the Court’s traditional (Inaudible) the principles in not confronting this case until it has to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.700" offset="13743572">A decision in the rape case will not necessarily decide those cases and those cases may simply be moot because the death sentences under these other crimes may never come to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.698" offset="13787562">As far as the racial history of the death penalty in Georgia goes, I think it is interesting that in the respondent’s brief, there is not one syllable of exculpation of the history of the death penalty for rape in Georgia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.860" offset="13844300">We have set forth the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.977" offset="13852764">It appears to be designed after the Civil War to punish black defendants who commit the crime of rape against white victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.058" offset="13897068">That is what observers have concluded and that is what statistics seem to show.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.393" offset="13914413">So this penalty does not come to this Court with a even-handed history of application.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.144" offset="13945342">I have mentioned that the case was not tried on a recidivist theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3464.622" offset="13959344">What I meant by that was that the jury was not instructed in any way as to Coker’s future dangerousness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.004" offset="13984839">Now, we have attacked this statute on its face, but we also feel that even if there are some rapes which may be capitally punished, this statute does not draw a defensible line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.683" offset="14031546">It may be that there is some kind of dangerousness test or harm to the victim test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.963" offset="14052653">This case was not tried on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.513" offset="14058818">It also was not tried on a theory of what a petitioner was likely to do in the future.</text>

            <label>Justice Thurgood Marshall</label>
            <text syncTime="3496.203" offset="14085672">Was not the jury charged on Sections 1 and 2 of that statute?</text>

            <label>Mr. David E. Kendall</label>
            <text syncTime="3499.568" offset="14099046">Yes, Mr. Justice Marshall they were, but they were charged on the capital felonies of armed robbery, murder and rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.604" offset="14127259">They were charged on the petitioner’s past record, but insofar as he constituted a threat in the future, there was nothing like the Texas capital punishment statute’s instruction to the jury to consider future harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.140" offset="14189326">Finally, the point about the Lex Stallones; this has always been a principle, a harsh retributive principle, but historically it has been used to limit the punishment and we submit that part of the reason for the repudiation of the death penalty may be simply a popular perception that, where life is not taken, life should not be forfeited.</text>
