            <text syncTime="87.676" offset="451218">This case is before this Court upon direct appeal from a Three-Judge District Court sitting in the Eastern District of North Carolina, holding that the North Carolina Department of Correction, under its then announced policies could not prohibit the formation and operation of the North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union within the facilities of the North Carolina Department of Correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.255" offset="581517">The Three-Judge Court, paying lip service to the opinion of this Court in Pell v. Procunier, cites Pell, and then immediately proceeds to emasculate the decision in Pell, subvert the holding of this Court in Pell, and require the North Carolina Department or Correction to provide resources to the North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union, and all other organizations equally and neutrally applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.572" offset="754761">We sought a stay at that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.639" offset="775032">The District Court denied a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.865" offset="787988">We sought a stay from this Court, and a stay was denied from this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.099" offset="812857">As a result of the denial of stays, it became necessary for the Department of Correction to issue regulations pursuant to the opinion of the Three-Judge Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.880" offset="868028">Those regulations are printed in the respondent’s brief, I believe on Page 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.443" offset="902300">However, the respondent in printing these regulations, has failed to provide one point.</text>

            <text syncTime="231.971" offset="1028419">The purpose of these rules is to regulate the activities of organized inmate groups not sponsored by Department of Correction in compliance with the order issued by the three-judge panel in North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union v. Jones, presently being reviewed by the United States Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.377" offset="1094039">The Department of Correction reserves the right to amend these rules, if that Court modifies the decision of the Lower Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.759" offset="1131551">In this case, the Department of Correction sought to take a moderate position.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.790" offset="1167704">The Three-Judge Court acknowledges the Department sought to take a moderate position.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.986" offset="1188393">The Three-Judge Court recognizes and admits that the correctional officials have real and sincere doubts about this organization and fears concerning the results that such an organization might bring.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.072" offset="1268746">Yet, the Three-Judge Court disregarded those fears.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.812" offset="1287763">Now, we have published regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.952" offset="1312318">Other organizations have gone with those regulations and are functioning.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.645" offset="1347113">The Prisoners’ Labor Union refused to comply.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.211" offset="1365294">They filed their original self-serving declaration when they first formed themselves, which was insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.414" offset="1418166">When we said it was insufficient, they sought an order to hold the correctional officials in contempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.925" offset="1448155">There was as a result an extensive plenary hearing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jacob L. Safron</label>
            <text syncTime="345.977" offset="1484413">Well, we have issued these regulations because we could not get a stay.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.330" offset="1509804">The Court at the contempt hearing found that the petition to hold the defendants in contempt was sought -- would be so intend to harass the defendants, the correctional officials, and that we had done everything required of us.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.781" offset="1575632">The Prisoners’ Labor Union does not currently exist, although under the rules, if they would properly apply, they could exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.152" offset="1621086">Anything that they say concerning any benefits that the correctional system has derived is mere puffing on their part.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.760" offset="1667583">According to the Three-Judge Court, we opened the doors.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.963" offset="1688377">We sponsored and recognized the Jaycees.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.337" offset="1713872">It is an organization, of course, with national roots in outside society.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.533" offset="1750653">It has served, and has been determined to serve, worthwhile rehabilitative goals within the Department of Correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.331" offset="1781791">But we have opened the door and the Three-Judge Court says the Fourteenth Amendment now denies us the opportunity to pick and choose among those organizations that can come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.991" offset="1820452">We have sponsored and worked with the Alcoholics Anonymous, obviously an organization with outside organizations which serves valid rehabilitative purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.576" offset="1870816">At our youth facility, we have the Boy Scouts, once again an organization that serves valid rehabilitative purposes and has good, solid roots in society.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.232" offset="1921389">But because we have brought in the AA, because we have brought in the Jaycees and the Boy Scouts, now the Three-Judge Court says we can no longer pick and choose among those organizations which utilize our resources, which utilize our time, and we must treat them all alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.348" offset="2005921">If we let someone come in from AA or the Boy Scouts from the outside, from free society, or the Jaycees, we must let someone come in from the Prisoners’ Labor Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.136" offset="2049076">If we permit the Jaycees to send in bundles of publications for distribution to their members, we must permit the Prisoners’ Labor Union to send in the bundles.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.379" offset="2109993">I would submit that the Three-Judge Court has not properly read the decision of this Court in Ross v. Moffitt.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.274" offset="2141549">There are obviously limits beyond which the Fourteenth Amendment cannot be stretched without breaking, and in this case I submit that the Fourteenth Amendment has been broken asunder.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.592" offset="2190868">Furthermore, this Court announced quite clearly in Pell v. Procunier, the basis under which correctional officials can pick and choose among various goals, and recognize the valid fears of correctional officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.302" offset="2257742">In this case, among those fears are concerted action, because even if the intent of this union is peaceable, I submit that common sense leads us to a conclusion that if their peaceable demands are not met, that inmates, prisoners who have already demonstrated an inability to live within the law, and quite often resort to violence as a means of determining their own ends, will of necessity resort to violence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1016.651" offset="4167084">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.723" offset="4179414">As Mr. Safron has indicated, the District Court in this case has held that the State of North Carolina is required by the First Amendment to allow inmates in its penal institutions to solicit other inmates, orally or in writing, for the purpose of encouraging membership in the North Carolina Prisoners’ Labor Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.308" offset="4249735">It has also permitted to inmates to receive outside correspondence and publications advocating prison unionism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.428" offset="4278261">In addition, the Court below has ruled that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires the State to accord the Prisoners’ Union mass mailing and meeting privileges within its correctional institutions to the same extent that any other inmate organization enjoys such operating privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.680" offset="4351195">The United States believes that this decision is incorrect, and that the District Court has intruded itself into an area that should properly be left to the sound discretion of correctional officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.068" offset="4392782">We believe in addition that if the Lower Court’s decision is upheld, it may lead to serious breaches of prison security and may impair efforts of inmate rehabilitation as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="1083.759" offset="4435518">Now, legal principles that govern this case are clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.492" offset="4450460">Without question, the anti-union regulations of the North Carolina Bureau of Corrections, like those of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, restrict to some extent the associational liberties of prison inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.126" offset="4501033">But this Court has emphasized on a number of occasions that First Amendment rights are not absolute, and that such rights must be considered in light of the special characteristics of the environment in which they are asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.160" offset="4545128">In a prison environment the controlling standard was articulated three years ago in Pell v. Procunier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.458" offset="4570310">There and upholding State and Federal regulations that erected a blanket prohibition against face-to-face interviews of prison inmates by representatives of the news media.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.544" offset="4610643">The Court stated that a prison inmate only retains those First Amendment rights that are not inconsistent with his status as a prisoner, or with the legitimate penological considerations of the correction system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.462" offset="4658395">Challenges the prison restrictions that are asserted to inhibit First Amendment rights, said the Court, must be analyzed in terms of the legitimate policies and goals of the correction system.</text>

            <text syncTime="1268.482" offset="5174470">Now, we have discussed in some length in our brief the serious problems that may reasonably be anticipated in the area of prisoner rehabilitation if inmate unions are allowed to function within the prison system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.253" offset="5217520">We have pointed out, and I believe it is not disputed, that efforts to change the value system of individual prisoners or to achieve inroads in the prison social structure would be severely frustrated if correctional officials had to deal with, or at least answer to an inmate group with pervasive influence throughout the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.338" offset="5289827">But I would like to limit my discussion here to the potential impact of such prisoner groups upon an even more important correctional goal; one that this Court in Pell termed central to all other institutional considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.620" offset="5338937">That is the internal security of the prison facilities themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.229" offset="5357432">It cannot be emphasized too strongly that this case involves a claim by prison inmates, that they have a constitutionally protected right to associate with other inmates, and to engage in concerted activity within the confines of the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.965" offset="5412393">Prisons are unlike any other institution in our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="1332.091" offset="5428903">They are closed communities of proven lawbreakers under the constant and close supervision of a limited staff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.153" offset="5457115">For obvious reasons, related both to the type of people who constitute the inmate population, and the conditions under which they inevitably must live.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.140" offset="5493059">The atmosphere in prisons is frequently tense and volatile, having no counterpart in the outside world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.204" offset="5517301">In these circumstances we believe, the presence of any concerted activity among inmates is a cause for concern.</text>

            <text syncTime="1562.960" offset="6352383">One is that inmates, like people generally, tend to behave with greater emotion and fewer inhibitions when acting as part of a group.</text>

            <text syncTime="2212.480" offset="8950418">One of the announced purposes of the Union is to secure favorable legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.371" offset="8969957">In one reform, one legislative reform the Union would desire, would be to allow prisoners to collectively bargain in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.110" offset="9000886">I must say not a very hopeful and not a very probable purpose, but nonetheless, that would be the way they would go about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.580" offset="9038816">They realize currently that even State employees are precluded from collective bargaining in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.291" offset="9069641">So the purpose would await legislative reform, if ever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.021" offset="9088553">But there is no intent to proceed unlawfully and to violate the State’s laws in that regard, nor can it be gleaned from any of the papers in the records, or from any of the evidence offered in Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.669" offset="9151143">The Union’s activities in the first six months before the ban came into effect included the publication of newsletters, the recruitment of 2,200 members; roughly one out of every six or seven inmates in the North Carolina Department of Correction became a member.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.832" offset="9223868">Some modest alterations of correctional procedure were claimed by the Union; getting hot showers at one unit, additional clothing and new linen in another.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.899" offset="9276112">The record indicates, without any rebutting evidence, that the Union defused certain racial incidents at central prison and brought about a degree of racial harmony there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.454" offset="9326268">That the personal responsibility of the members was enhanced through the democratic processes of the Union, and that the Union helped to build self-reliance among its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.548" offset="9378721">Now, since the District Court judgment on May 12th, 1976, another 12 months of existence, I do not feel at liberty to depart from the record and discuss what has happened, except to say that the Union does exist, and it does publish newsletters, contrary to Mr. Safron’s assertions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2339.573" offset="9458761">There is in the record the regulation that the Department of Correction adopted, pursuant to the District Court’s opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.279" offset="9485614">The regulation applies neutrally to all organizations of inmates within the prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.042" offset="9508707">It imposes what we concede are legitimate and constitutional time, place, and manner of restrictions, such as a maximum of 25 people attending meetings and holding meetings only if adequate supervision is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2367.910" offset="9572132">The regulation of March 26th, 1975, at issue here, on its face prohibits solicitation of membership, denies the use of departmental property to the Union, and excludes outside organizers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2384.184" offset="9637229">In addition, as applied from the record we learned that the regulation banned the bulk mailing of newsletters by the Union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.087" offset="9672860">Also, the regulation banned the circulation of any written material that could be deemed a channel for solicitation, so that we must regard any discussion of benefits, purposes, or even existence of the Union as being subject to that ban.</text>

            <text syncTime="3943.453" offset="15874330">We agree that a lot of what they do is right, like their new regulation, we are not about to challenge, we think it is right, the one that regulates time, place and manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3951.561" offset="15906721">But we certainly cannot conceive that putting the Union out of business was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3956.045" offset="15924694">Thank you, sir.</text>

            <label>Mr. Jacob L. Safron</label>
            <text syncTime="3958.812" offset="15935770">Yes, Your Honor, just a bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.950" offset="15948308">First of all, I would like to point out that in our memorandum in the District Court, this is what we have said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3971.226" offset="15985402">Page 2 of the memorandum, it is in the record, apparently the plaintiff, that is the Labor Union, is not seeking to establish a national labor relations or type of labor union in the prison system.</text>
            <text syncTime="3983.644" offset="16035035">That was our statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.753" offset="16043499">We went on to say more accurately, what they want to form is an organized group of elected representatives of inmates within the prison to meet together and to take their proposals, criticisms, suggestions, and the like to the administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3998.883" offset="16096057">Now, that is what we have said in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.991" offset="16112462">Number two, we never have -- let me phrase it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="4009.407" offset="16138166">Our situation vis-à-vis the Union, with its office located in Durham is that inmates, and we took that moderate position, could join this outside organization, and that is what I want to emphasize.</text>
            <text syncTime="4023.517" offset="16194591">We never denied their right to join this outside organization as we have never denied the right for the inmates to join any organization of their choice, we could not do it, we could not perform lobotomies on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="4033.824" offset="16235760">Now, these are copies of various newsletters which they published; one of which is attached to the complaint which is part of the record in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4040.662" offset="16263136">That tells how an organizer came from California to attempt to organize the North Carolina Department of Correction.</text>
            <text syncTime="4047.083" offset="16288841">I submit this is part of a national group.</text>
            <text syncTime="4049.974" offset="16300439">Every one of their newsletters contains the same authorization for representation for collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="4058.826" offset="16335757">The one that is in the record contains that, the ones which were published subsequently contain that.</text>

            <text syncTime="4063.659" offset="16355087">Other than the contribution of the AFL-CIO, is there anything in the record about a linkage between the formal organized labor unions?</text>

            <label>Mr. Jacob L. Safron</label>
            <text syncTime="4081.163" offset="16425200">I cannot answer that, Your Honor, I really do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.304" offset="16437739">Now, I would like to say this that the design of our response in this case is based on Packett v. Manson, the decision of the District Court for Connecticut.</text>
            <text syncTime="4093.720" offset="16475355">That was our basis for response, and we followed the Packer holding almost verbatim.</text>
            <text syncTime="4100.381" offset="16502000">I would submit that Packett is an excellent discussion of the applicable law in this case, it is well thought out.</text>
            <text syncTime="4107.067" offset="16528749">Now, the Three-Judge Court never even mentions Packett, just disregards Packett, as if the decision does not exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="4114.259" offset="16557484">Now, as far as alternatives, under Pell v. Procunier, in North Carolina these prisoners are not held in outer darkness, number one, they may write to anyone, and they write to the press and their letters appear in letters to the editor.</text>
            <text syncTime="4128.497" offset="16614535">They may write to anyone, they may be visited by the press, unlike Pell v. Procunier.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.497" offset="16638463">The press can come in and interview specific inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="4138.352" offset="16653928">We have an organized inmate grievance commission which was funded this year $125,000, it exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="4144.877" offset="16680050">According to their records, last year they handled 4,755 complaints from the inmates, so the inmates have full correspondence.</text>
            <text syncTime="4157.245" offset="16729474">Last Saturday, the Secretary of Corrections spoke before the North Carolina Civil Liberties Union at the annual convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="4166.332" offset="16765837">There are alternatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="4169.273" offset="16777539">That was the situation Pell spoke to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4172.482" offset="16790392">They are not held in outer darkness.</text>
            <text syncTime="4174.412" offset="16798124">Now, I would submit further, under Pell, the big man theory is applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="4178.451" offset="16814320">The organizers of this union, the inmates in this system, as revealed in Footnote No. 16, are inmates who have had a history of violence in this system.</text>
            <text syncTime="4189.182" offset="16857265">Two are murderers, the third is a con man who has even refused his own identity, and we had to prove in Federal Court that he...</text>

            <text syncTime="4198.754" offset="16895508">No, Your Honor, but the AA unit has outside representatives, members of society who have proven their worth in the outside community and have come in to lend their assistance to helping the inmates become rehabilitated and returned to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="4215.410" offset="16962173">That is the difference here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4217.312" offset="16969696">These outside individuals are out to serve a social good.</text>
            <text syncTime="4223.033" offset="16992579">Now, the newsletters, as I showed the Court copies, are published in Durham at that office.</text>
            <text syncTime="4227.882" offset="17012014">The organization, if it exists, does not exist within the prison system today.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.464" offset="17026330">They have never satisfied our regulations and the Federal Court has found that they have not properly attempted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="4237.521" offset="17050571">Now, if they say it exists and newsletters have been printed, yes, in Durham, and they have come in and as I have said previously, and as their newsletter number 1, attached to the complaint illustrates, it is part an attempt of a national organization. aAnd</text>
            <text syncTime="4254.305">I would submit, and all the cases show, that there has in fact been an attempt nationally for these inmates to organize together.</text>
