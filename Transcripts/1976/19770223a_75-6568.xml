            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Diedrick</label>
            <text syncTime="58.451" offset="334281">Mr. Chief justice, may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.026" offset="352566">I am here representing Johnny Hankerson who is the petitioner in this case, to petition this court for certiorari from a Supreme Court decision in North Carolina against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.575" offset="394780">The question we content and present it here is where the Supreme Court of North Carolina erred in not applying Mullaney retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.883" offset="424037">Since the doctrine of Mullaney as relates to petitioner?s case greatly affected the fact finding process, the reliability of the fact finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.235" offset="461445">The State Court held that by raising the decision of Mullaney, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the use of their long standing rules in homicide cases, that a defendant in order to rebut the presumption of malice must prove to the satisfaction of the jury that he killed in the heat of sudden passion and to rebut the presumption of unlawfulness that he killed in self defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.299" offset="565726">They held that those instructions as they were given in our case violated the concept to Due Process announced by this court in Mullaney.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.248" offset="601461">However, they decline without further guidance from this court to apply it retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.559" offset="630718">The petitioner contends that the main determination to be made by this court in whether or not to give Mullaney retroactivity is whether or not the major purpose of the new constitutional doctrine as to over come an aspect of a criminal trial that substantially impairs its truth finding function.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.461" offset="706369">The petitioner contends that in order to do that this court must closely scrutinize the major purpose which it held Mullaney to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.720" offset="747329">This court in its opinion on Mullaney relied heavily on Winship.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.646" offset="779094">This court further, in Ivan held Winship to be retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.066" offset="796753">However, the petitioner contends that this court in its own language in Mullaney, said that the rule that -- whether the major purposes of Mullaney was to protect the integrity of the requirements of the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt being carried by the prosecution in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.285" offset="885673">It went on further to say that this major purpose to be served by this rule was at even greater purpose than that which was set forth in Winship and I quote from Mr. Justice Powell?s opinion at Page 700.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.370" offset="949935">?Not only are the interests underlying Winship implicated to a greater degree in this case, but in one respect the protection afforded those interests less here".</text>
            <text syncTime="222.606" offset="990895">In Winship the ultimate burden of persuasion remained with the prosecution although the standard had been reduced to proof by a preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.793" offset="1027675">In this case, that is in the Mullaney case, by contrast that state has affirmatively shifted the burden of proof to defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.109" offset="1060903">The result in a case such as this one where the defendant is required to prove the critical fact in dispute is to increase further the likelihood of an erroneous murder conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.268" offset="1113566">Therefore, the petitioner contends that this Court has already held in its decision of Mullaney that the major purpose to be served by that rule was to correct an error in the fact finding process, because they have stated this to increase further likelihood and rated as to do away with the increase of the further likelihood of an erroneous murder conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.354" offset="1213876">Of necessity in determining whether or not to apply any of these new constitutional rules retroactively, the court must look at prior decisions and whether or not they have given those decisions perspective only or retroactive applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.972" offset="1276361">However, the petitioner in this case contends that you need only look to Ivan as far as it relates to the case of the bar, because of the fact that Mullaney says that the interest to be protected in Mullaney itself are greater than those on Winship.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.852" offset="1355877">That, here, it is not only proof beyond a reasonable doubt to be protected but further that it places the burden solely on the state to carry this burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.385" offset="1406033">That is to say in the Winship case it was proved by a preponderance of the evidence but at all time that proof rested solely upon the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.293" offset="1449709">In Mullaney, it removes that burden of proof or the main rule which was corrected by this court in Mullaney, move that burden of proof or shift to that burden of proof to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.791" offset="1503626">In the main case, or the Mullaney case, this court stated that in main itself, the prosecution was required to prove the absence of self defense beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.502" offset="1562454">Now, in North Carolina until the Hankerson decision, that is the case which is at the bar, the defendant himself had to satisfy the jury that he did act in self defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.167" offset="1609161">That is to say that the burden of proof was shifted from the state to the defendant to come forward and satisfy the jury of the four things necessary for them to return the verdict of acquittal on the grounds of self defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.886" offset="1667988">So, the petitioner honestly contends that while a review of all of the other cases involving retroactivity and being applied perspectively is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.000" offset="1716472">This court need look no further than the language of Mullaney and applying it with Ivan and Winship.</text>

            <text syncTime="414.012" offset="1756491">In this case under the prior North Carolina Law until changed by the Supreme Court in this case, there were two separate matters in which the purpose of persuasion at least was shifted to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.365" offset="1857951">First, the absence of malice which would reduce the homicide to manslaughter.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.991" offset="2476426">Therefore, I would argue to you that the judgment of acquittal or virtue a plea of self defense is a negative of a necessary element.</text>

            <text syncTime="980.491" offset="4022457">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.040" offset="4036668">The State of North Carolina, of course, is quite concerned over the reach and the scope of your decision in the Mullaney case.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.282" offset="4089644">The State of North Carolina feels that its Supreme Court was essentially correct in its ruling on the retroactivity portion of the Mullaney opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.648" offset="4143038">The state feels that the Mullaney opinion should not be applied retroactively by this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.769" offset="4187551">Now, the state recognizes, of course, the rule that when the primary purpose of the new constitutional doctrine is to substantially improve the reliability of the fact finding process that more often than not you have held that type of decision to be retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.200" offset="4281278">However, the State of North Carolina would argue in this case that your Mullaney decision because it was as we say on the fringes more or less of the question of how much proof is required in a criminal case and who has the burden of persuasion and what not, that this decision and the changes that it made in the rules relating to burden of proof on affirmative defenses has not brought such a dramatic improvement in the fact finding process so as to require the automatic retroactivity of this decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.251" offset="4485451">The state of course has cited the court to certain psychological studies in its brief concerning jury perceptions in criminal cases and where in many instances, the juries have been quite reluctant to convict and have a much higher standard beyond a reasonable doubt and have a much higher standard in where self defense is right, and of course as this court pointed out not too long ago in the death penalty cases, that jury nullification of death penalty or cases involving the death penalty in many instances has brought about the change that society recognizes now in the imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.021" offset="4700596">The point, I am trying to make of course is that juries are very knowledgeable and very sensitive and are quite perceptive and the state feels that the changing of the rules, the burden of persuasion by the Mullaney case has not significantly improved the fact finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.947" offset="4796308">Therefore, the state feels that this court can quite legitimately and properly consider the other two factors of justified reliance on the part of the state and the impact that retroactivity would have on both State of North Carolina and on other states similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.832" offset="4907799">Of course, the State of North Carolina feels that a retroactive application of Mullaney would have an almost disastrous impact on North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.858" offset="4967881">There are something over a thousand people currently in the North Carolina prisons involving murder type prosecutions, while perhaps not all of them would ultimately prevail nevertheless, surely petitions would have to be heard either of a post conviction type or a federal habeas corpus type.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.793" offset="5075610">The expense in both dollars and cents and prosecutorial time in dredging up old cases that everybody thought had long been in repose, some 15 or 20 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="1263.737" offset="5155440">The difficulty of finding the transcripts of the cases that perhaps were not appealed, does the court reporter still have the records, if she or he has died, have the records been preserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.194" offset="5217298">How in the world, I suppose it can be done but it would be an extremely difficult, costly and time consuming process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1319.499" offset="5378526">But assuming you adopt the North Carolina Court?s analysis, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.864" offset="5399946">Now, as I understand it, probably the first degree murder convictions would survive because you have to prove the element of premeditation and deliberation on the felony or what not beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.316" offset="5461699">But in the second degree case, where either an involuntary manslaughter issue was presented or a self defense issue was presented and possibly if this court should go so far as to extend this doctrine into other areas such as entrapment or what not and that type of defense was raised then possibly even there.</text>
