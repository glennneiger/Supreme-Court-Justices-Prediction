            <text syncTime="50.960" offset="307179">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.756" offset="322435">We speak for East Texas Motor Freight, which was charged with violating the Civil Rights Act, for refusing to transfer three Mexican-Americans from city driving jobs they held in San Antonio to road jobs in some other city.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.688" offset="382098">Plaintiffs originally sought class relief as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.780" offset="394533">But as we shall discuss later, the trial and record really developed as a suit by three individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.354" offset="424835">The defendants were acquitted securing a dismissal after trial of all charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.855" offset="442807">The Fifth Circuit reversed, deciding that it could determine from its level that the matter warranted class treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.342" offset="472691">It set the classes and remanded for remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.036" offset="495470">I should say it found liability to them as well and remanded for remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.561" offset="513651">We seek reversal of that Fifth Circuit decision, restoration of the District Court judgment or at least a remand for a proper class determination by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.380" offset="556910">In the event the District Court should certify a class for some trial on liability, we seek guidance on the use of racial statistics as an evidentiary device.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.664" offset="602049">A brief statement of our special facts is in order because of the regrettable tendency of the appellate court to treat all Title VII and trucking industry cases alike.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.101" offset="647816">We think we have unique facts in this case, which we should like to tell, not only to secure justice for ourselves, but also to put some rational bounds on the generalizations that have come to dominate Title VII litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.058" offset="703613">The company is a common carrier with many terminals stretching across the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.633" offset="721899">At some of those terminals, it has both city drivers and road drivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.384" offset="740916">At other terminals, it only has city jobs available.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.161" offset="760038">Mr. Rodriguez, Mr. Herrera and Mr. Perez were city drivers in San Antonio who applied for transfer to a road job in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.702" offset="798177">When their applications were not considered, they attacked the transfer denial as a violation, arguing that the company's localized hiring practice and rule against city to road transfer, as well as the contract seniority system were facially neutral policies that locked them in to lesser jobs.</text>

            <text syncTime="194.930" offset="883127">There is evidence that upon the acquisition of a predecessor company with -- that company had one driver domiciled at that point because of the way its system fit, but that ceased to be the practice and that was unexceptional in this record as far as all parties were concerned.</text>

            <text syncTime="216.791" offset="970585">But I -- I'm at a loss to know in which direction.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.050" offset="979571">I think it was to the north of (Inaudible).</text>
            <text syncTime="221.825" offset="990647">The key fact here is that when plaintiffs originally applied for jobs, they did so in a place where there were no road jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.025" offset="1019486">They asked for and got the only job that the company had to offer in San Antonio.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.488" offset="1037354">And we think that these facts distinguished this case, from Franks against Bowman and the similar seniority cases with which this Court is familiar.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.851" offset="1074761">Plaintiffs complained of civil rights violations as to themselves and a class of Mexican-Americans and Blacks.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.151" offset="1104018">All defendants opposed the claim for class relief in their answers.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="255.080" offset="1123662">There was no claim of any discrimination in their original hiring.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.660" offset="1142053">And, well, if you're right that these were -- if they were hired on their first application, they couldn't have been.</text>

            <text syncTime="266.322" offset="1168697">And not only that, Your Honor, but at the trial, plaintiffs stipulated that they had not been discriminated against when they were hired at San Antonio.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.264" offset="1204433">Plaintiffs did not move for a class certification.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.724" offset="1218226">No court-managed pretrial conference occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.609" offset="1233795">On the morning of the trial, the parties reached case-narrowing stipulations, the most important of which was, and I quote, “The only issue presently before the Court pertaining to the company is whether its failure to consider plaintiffs' application violated Title VII and Section 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.534" offset="1305475">So, the trial went on.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.804" offset="1314565">The ruling rejecting any class status came in the post-trial findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.343" offset="1336717">During trial, a colloquy among court and counsel showed opposition to and doubt about whether this was being tried as a class action.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.474" offset="1373288">In the Fifth Circuit, the District Court's findings of non-discrimination as to the named plaintiffs and lack of personal qualifications were reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.718" offset="1470255">Is it your position here, not only that there should have been no class certification on the merits, but that they were under some sort of obligation to file a separate motion during the trial?</text>

            <text syncTime="354.204" offset="1520201">That is, the -- and -- and it is precisely the first point of argument we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.035" offset="1539532">The fundamental error of the Fifth Circuit in our opinion was its disbelief that the plaintiffs had abandoned or waived the class action aspects of it.</text>

            <text syncTime="368.887" offset="1578924">Well, now, the -- those are two separate points, I would think.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.639" offset="1589896">One is, after you requested a class certification, your complaint to simply omit filing a motion prior to trial under the -- I think that would stand on quite a different footing than if in a stipulation in an open court, you say, we no longer seek class certification.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard C. Hotvedt</label>
            <text syncTime="389.565" offset="1661680">Well, Your Honor, it's our view that the -- that the burden for moving under Rule 23 to clear up the confusion in cases of this kind, should very well be placed upon plaintiffs whose responsibility it is to fulfill the internal elements of the rule as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.290" offset="1732524">We point out that in this record, we had the cumulative development of no movement for class certification by the plaintiff, the stipulation I have referred to and then the form of a trial which concentrated upon the individual issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.929" offset="1811101">And we think that for these reasons, the reasoning of the District Court judge was correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.154" offset="1835969">And more important from our standpoint, we had reason to rely upon it being tried as an individual action, and we think it was error for the Court of Appeals to disbelieve that it was tried as an individual action.</text>

            <text syncTime="536.275" offset="2248495">But my point is not that this record is ready to demonstrate, we could have satisfied such a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.067" offset="2267617">My point is, we deserve the fresh chance to counter such an approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.542" offset="2293530">We -- one of the points that the Fifth Circuit made in -- in saying that it's of little mind that Rule 23 is being decided at this level rather than at the District Court level, was that, one should take a liberal approach to the interpretation of Title VII or of Rule 23 in Title VII cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.489" offset="2377331">That expression about liberality in the interpretation of Rule 23 is all right as far as it goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.158" offset="2403976">But I think it arose, at first, in the context of Title VII, when defendant employers in the early 1960s or mid 1960s were saying, “No classes should arise in Title VII cases.”</text>
            <text syncTime="587.901" offset="2454967">And so, the dictum arose that -- that these are inherent class cases or these relief is inherently class relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.658" offset="2482030">But that's what it is, a generalization or a dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.222" offset="2496240">What we're faced with today arising from at least this Court of Appeals is the notion that Rule 23 in Title VII cases contains within it some mandate for an automatic result in favor of the plaintiffs on the class issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.753" offset="2554337">And that's the extreme we call into question.</text>

            <text syncTime="682.313" offset="2832593">We certainly would, but it would much depend on the shape of the class, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.967" offset="2847222">For example, the consent decree has overlapping reaches down into the group that arises in San Antonio.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.052" offset="2879613">We may very well have arguments that the class should be so narrow to one terminal or just a few terminals or to just a limited number of persons in the light of what justice was secured under the auspices of Judge Sarah Hughes in -- in Dallas when we reached the consent decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.938" offset="2955160">We would further find that in its application internally of Rule 23, the Fifth Circuit erred by its somewhat cavalier approach to how you go about satisfying the internal elements.</text>
            <text syncTime="726.916" offset="3011062">I won't dwell on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.988" offset="3015346">We briefed it extensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.657" offset="3022033">We would simply state that we think it unfair for the Court of Appeals to say that there is no serious challenge that the internal elements of Rule 23 (a) have been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.693" offset="3062157">That hasn't even been the focus yet.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.150" offset="3071979">We think that plaintiffs, even in a Title VII case, should be put to the test of those rules and if we get a class action determination, we're prepared to challenge commonality, typicality.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.494" offset="3121298">Indeed, adequacy of representation has not been aired.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.506" offset="3133419">And it's interesting that we have here, for example, the implications of severe questions about commonality and typicality and adequacy of representation arising from within facts where you have people of different kinds of ethnic discrimination being claimed with Mexican-Americans borrowing statistics from Blacks with people from San Antonio with no road jobs being represented by counsel with aspirations to speak for people at domicile terminals.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.624" offset="3245850">The implications of need for such an airing of those issues are pretty clear, we think, on the remand.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.206" offset="3272182">We turn now to the proof of liability issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.242" offset="3292348">We think that the Court of Appeals erred in establishing the components of a prima facie case in class actions under Title VII by the sweeping assumption that statistical differences between work force and population, standing alone, are sufficient to make a prima facie case.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.587" offset="3361729">Preliminary here, we would note the Government position which arrives in recent weeks and where we note that it -- it urges a remand for a new trial on the issue of liability, saying that the Fifth Circuit erred by determining liability to a class and they concede that this could have been premature and prejudicial to the defendant employer with no fair change to contest liability on a class scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.154" offset="3464025">It's a welcome concession.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.767" offset="3470399">We think it carries within it the logical implication that we were similarly disadvantaged on the class issue, but we -- we're prepared to receive at any terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.965" offset="3515225">As the proof of discrimination, based on statistics alone are, at least, sufficient to shift the burden of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.253" offset="3544377">We recognize that proof of discrimination seldom comes in quotable form.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.580" offset="3573739">One has to search for circumstantial evidence, expressions, remarks, conduct, inconsistent behavior and indeed statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.015" offset="3627447">But what we are seeing now is the statement that a raw numerical disparity over a broad geographical area between population statistics and the employer's workforce constitutes that element of proof which will shift the burden, from the plaintiff to the defendant, and in a court, such as the Fifth Circuit, put the employer in a hole from which it is very difficult to extricate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.313" offset="3740609">We think it especially ironic that this reliance on such undifferentiated statistics should arise under a statute which contains the congressional caution of Section 703 (j).</text>
            <text syncTime="921.615" offset="3789824">We're not suggesting that that section prohibits the use of statistics at all, but when the Congress goes to the trouble of suggesting that one should not create special favor for a particular ethnic or racial type because of a statistical imbalance, one thinks then that the development of evidentiary rules under the statute should very well take place in a careful manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.070" offset="3891702">And we ask, what is the logical reach of -- or what is the inference to be drawn from a statistical imbalance on a broad scale?</text>

            <text syncTime="1173.227" offset="4796270">The Fifth Circuit reversed as to the union's and specifically 657 with this language, that their role in establishing separate seniority rosters that fail to make allowance for minority city drivers who have been discriminatorily relegated to city driver jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.755" offset="4894386">I understand that language to mean that Local 657 has been held by the Fifth Circuit to have violated both, Section 1981 of Title 42, and Title VII, for failing to establish some type contractual right to transfer with what is commonly called “company seniority”.</text>

            <text syncTime="1465.984" offset="5967287">That statistical summary also showed that since 1965, the majority of the employees within the jurisdiction, representation jurisdiction of Local 657, working for this employer were also Mexican-Americans and Negroes, certainly negating any contention that would end the jurisdiction of Local 657, there was any hiring discrimination by this employer with which this local defendant could have participated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1502.430" offset="6113050">Now, then, the -- in the briefs before the Court, we'd call the Court's attention to the bargaining procedures which were followed in the negotiation of the National Master Freight Agreement and also the Southern Conference Supplement to which Local 657 is a party by reason of having given powers of attorney to National and Regional Negotiating Committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.948" offset="6255156">There is also evidence in this record that at no time from the period of 1952 to the date of the trial had any member of this Local Union ever complain in a meeting called for the purpose of presenting contractual demands to the employer that there was racial discrimination in these contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.198" offset="6372185">There is also evidence in this record that at no time since 1952 had any minority member of this union in the proper meetings call for the purpose of obtaining contractual demands ever made a complaint that these contracts locked them in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.942" offset="6459120">And at that so-called lock in was racially discriminatorily.</text>

            <text syncTime="1639.274" offset="6660472">I think that there is also a stipulation in this record that insofar as Local 657 is concerned, that no white city driver has ever transferred from a city driver's job within the jurisdiction of Local 657, to a road driver's job and carried with him his company's seniority for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.842" offset="6782725">In fact, if my memory serves me right, I don't recall there being any evidence of a city driver transferring to a road job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.950" offset="6895156">The Court has long ago, recognized that national bargaining units are recommended and promoted by Congress by reason of the National Labor Relations Act and as I have already stated, Local 657 entered into this contract and was into this negotiating unit and was bound by its decision as a bargaining unit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1742.198" offset="7072162">First of all, I'd like to point out as the Court may be aware, there's an important factual distinction between this case and the one that preceded it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.656" offset="7102046">That is, the employer's absolute no-transfer rule at the San Antonio terminal which absolutely prohibited the possibility of city drivers transferring to road jobs under any circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.370" offset="7152828">As we pointed out on our brief herein, accordingly, where there can be no-transfer -- transfer, seniority rules which operate only on transfer, in fact never operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.006" offset="7195355">So indeed at the San Antonio terminal, they had no causal effect and are not an active consideration in regard to alleged violation of Title VII.</text>

            <text syncTime="1808.694" offset="7338193">Initially, I'd like to say that Mr. Justice White, I think, is correct, in his questions about the position of the union as a Rule 19 defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.024" offset="7379466">We think that would be our proper position in these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.886" offset="7394931">That is so, because we regard our seniority systems as bonafide, not having the genesis in racial discrimination and because we would then be present for the accordance of relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.207" offset="7448221">But I do want to state that we regard this Court's opinion in Franks, as being very clear that in as much as our systems are bonafide, they do not and cannot be read to bar rightful place relief and in clarification of what was said to and by Mr. Wells, I'm authorized to state that this union supported at the time of this trial and this case in Rodriguez and (Inaudible) before that in sense, a proposition of rightful place relief in these kinds of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="2153.092" offset="8715786">That is what respondents say, they want here as relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="2175.255" offset="8804394">There was no other evidence offered at trial as to any other individual, number one, applying for or even wanting a road job as to any other individual in a class of some 200 people, the class they wanted, the Texas-wide class even being qualified for a right -- road job and scant evidence as to vacancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.875" offset="8886836">This Court recognized the McDonald versus Santa Fe Trail that indeed the union's Title VII obligation extends to members and represent employees of all races were we unilaterally to award road seniority to minority city people under those circumstances, rights, would absolutely have a claim of reversed discrimination against us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.217" offset="8992266">We have to wait until either the individuals alleged discrimination and seek and use the grievance procedure to prove it to get the rightful place that way or go to court or if we can have a factual a factual situation, whereas, we do from time to time work out an agreement and affect the award that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.643" offset="9061961">But the Solicitor General himself has agreed in his brief in the Jersey Central case that to prefer any minority individual simply because it has membership in a class rather than based on a showing of individual discrimination would be to affect reversed discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.560" offset="9125595">That's what's prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.113" offset="9131865">We don't want to affect reversed discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2437.917" offset="9855039">In approaching these difficult questions however, I would urge the Court, not to lose sight of two simple facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.907" offset="9878967">The first one is that the record shows that East Texas Motor Freight is a blatantly discriminatory employer and the East Texas Motor Freight is joined by the union petitioners in seeking to perpetuate the effects of their traditional and nationwide commitment to employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.762" offset="9946467">Petitioner's arguments boil down to a salvo of complicated legal reasons for denying through their Mexican-American and Black employees and members, what this Court said in Albemarle Paper Company and Franks v. Bowman was due them, complete relief, from petitioner's employment discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.663" offset="10018043">In my argument, I wish to focus on the three of the reasons advanced by petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.713" offset="10038209">One, that this was not a proper transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2485.873" offset="10046882">Second that we did not prove a prima facie class case, and third, that the no-transfer rule and seniority system of petitioners did not violate the law.</text>
