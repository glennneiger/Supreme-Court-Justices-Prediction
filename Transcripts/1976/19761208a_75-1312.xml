            <text syncTime="32.554" offset="233618">The corporation maintains its books in an accrual basis method of accounting and also has an employees' profit-sharing plan for the benefit of its company employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.093" offset="287744">The company has a fiscal year ending April 30th, and according to the accrual method of accounting, must file its tax return on or before July 15th of each year.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.441" offset="341138">For the years April 30, 1967, 1968 and 1969 the Board of Directors of the corporation before the end of the year, accrued a liability for the employees' profit-sharing plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.392" offset="404982">Subsequent to the end of the corporation fiscal year, but prior to the time for the filing of the tax return, the company transferred to the trustees of the profit-sharing plan a secured demand interest-bearing note of the corporation guaranteed by the president, vice-president, and treasurer of the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.091" offset="495783">It was -- has been stipulated that the value of the collateral and net worth of one of the guarantors exceeded the value of the note which was the amount of the claim deduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.713" offset="670177">One of which was that the company was an expanding company and it's in capital intense and needs a lot of inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.399" offset="708942">And also, they felt that the company was a good place to invest the money and pay as good a return as they would be getting and investing in the stocks or some other investment.</text>

            <text syncTime="200.751" offset="906428">Didn't -- didn't you indicate one reason was because of better return on other investments?</text>

            <label>Mr. Marvin L. Schrager</label>
            <text syncTime="204.878" offset="922833">Well, the corporation paid interests to the profit-sharing plan and they felt that in the years in question, this would be as good return as they would get by investing elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.327" offset="984691">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service, upon examination, disallowed the claim deduction contending that the transfer of the note in satisfaction of the accrued liability did not constitute payment under Section 404 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.957" offset="1051251">After the denial, the petitioner filed a case in the Tax Court and after all of the facts were stipulated to arguments and briefs submitted, the Tax Court as it has consistently done, reaffirmed the Commissioner and denied the deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.421" offset="1121050">An appeal was then taken to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and after arguments, the Court of Appeals held for the Commissioner, but by doing so, they declined to follow decisions of the Third, Ninth and Tenth Circuit which had previously held that the transfer of a note by an accrual basis taxpayer did constitute payment under Section 404 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code if the transfer was made and the delivery was made within two and a half months after the close of the taxpayer's fiscal year.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.789" offset="1262529">This created a split in the circuits and we filed a petition for writ of certiorari which was granted by this Court and that's the basic issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.016" offset="1311431">The issue before the Court is whether or not, as I've stated, the transfer or delivery of a note by an accrual basis taxpayer constitutes payment of an accrued liability to a profit-sharing plan if made within two and a half months after the close of the taxpayer's fiscal year.</text>

            <label>Mr. Marvin L. Schrager</label>
            <text syncTime="328.639" offset="1417906">Different rates that corresponded to the rates that were being charged by banks in our local community, and the rates would differ from the larger money senders.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.958" offset="1475166">They don't -- they don't fluctuate quite as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.062" offset="1495646">In dealing with the issue, I believe that we have to talk about three sections of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.337" offset="1524694">First, Section 162, which provides for the deduction of ordinary and necessary business expenses which are paid or incurred by the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.463" offset="1577253">We also must deal with Section 267 which -- which refers to deductions which are allowed when paid and Section 267 deals with related taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.164" offset="1636080">We also are dealing with Section 404 which deals with contributions to an employee's pension or profit-sharing plan, and which also contains the language that the deduction is allowed when paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.324" offset="1700655">The reason that we have to take into consideration these three sections is that were not for the express establishment of these sections, the deduction would have been allowable under Section 162 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.331" offset="1768678">We maintain that contributions to an employee's pension or profit-sharing plan are considered as additional employee compensation, and should -- and would be covered under 162 were it not for Section 404.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.626" offset="1833880">Now, prior to the Court of Appeals' decision below, 20 years of case law have treated Section 404 and Section 267 and their predecessors which 23 (p) is the predecessor -- predecessor to Section 404 and Section 24 (c) is the predecessor to Section 267.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.451" offset="1921128">And case law has treated them synonymously, and we feel that this is important in following the evolution of the point where we are today.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.192" offset="1968149">Petitioner maintains that first, Section 267 was established by Congress and then Section 404 was established by Congress to stop tax avoidance and to close a tax loophole that existed under the Internal Revenue Code for the following reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.475" offset="2061249">Suppose that I am the president and -- and stockholder of a close corporation, the corporation is on a fiscal year and on an accrual basis method of accounting.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.113" offset="2107852">I, as the president, would be on a cash basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.512" offset="2125406">Under Section 162, the corporation could have accrued a liability to me, say, I got a salary and a bonus.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.235" offset="2164276">They could have paid me the salary and accrued the bonus but never paid it.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.686" offset="2186115">And therefore, they would be entitled to a deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.436" offset="2197086">I, as a cash basis taxpayer, not having received the money, would not have to report that on my income tax return until the year that it was paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.227" offset="2236270">If I never took the money out of the corporation, I would never have to show it.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.039" offset="2255496">They would just keep it as an accrued liability but would have taken the deduction.</text>

            <text syncTime="556.525" offset="2329475">It was, Justice Blackmun, until such time that Section 267 was established at which time they stated that certain related taxpayers if you accrued it, it must be paid within two and a half months after the end of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.787" offset="2398542">And I must take it into income at that time, if you were an independent creditor of the company or a non-owner employee, they could have accrued the -- accrued the liability taken the deduction but you would not have to report it until received.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.534" offset="2477537">But I as a related taxpayer, and that's what we're talking about, must show an income within two and a half months after the end of the year.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.570" offset="2513690">It must be paid within that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.360" offset="2524766">This was the reason that 267, we feel, was enacted by Congress to close that tax loophole between related taxpayers.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.069" offset="2579623">Subsequently, we feel that Section 404 was also enacted to do the same thing with employee profit-sharing plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.672" offset="2622046">We feel that Congress felt that because of the possible closeness and relationship between the owner and maybe the trustees of the plan that they felt that something must be paid within two and a half months that you must transfer something of value must be transferred and delivered to the trustees of the profit-sharing plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="695.456" offset="2885151">And prior to the enactment of ERISA, many corporations, small corporations, the shareholder was the sole trustee of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.277" offset="2936456">And I think that there was this type of related taxpayer basis between the owner and the corporation that they were trying to stop potential misdealings and they wanted something actually delivered to the trustees of the plan, so that an employee in seeing the plan could know that something was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.196" offset="3032168">And also, under the Internal Revenue Code, the corporate -- the trustees of the plan are obligated to file annual reports showing the assets of the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.877" offset="3090892">The -- in this area, there has been much litigation, and the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service starting with Section 267 and following through with Section 404, has always maintained in the beginning that paid, meant paid in cash.</text>

            <text syncTime="805.549" offset="3325576">The corporation took a deduction and the Commissioner disallowed it stating that notes paid -- notes did not constitute payment under -- and that was Section 24 (c) which was the predecessor to Section 267 in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.304" offset="3400600">The Court of -- the Tax Court affirmed and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit overturned and ruled that paid included the transfer of a note, the delivery of a note, that a note constituted payment under Section 24 (c) for an accrual basis taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.584" offset="3489729">In that case, they talked about the things which I have talked about today, the tax avoidance and the history of why they wanted to establish this section.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.880" offset="3534869">And they also, in addition stated that if were not for 24 (c), this would have been deductible under 24 (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="867.089" offset="3571754">In holding for the taxpayer, Musselman Hub-Brake Company, the Court explicitly rejected the Commissioner of Internal Revenue Service position that accrual basis and cash basis taxpayers were on equal footing under Section 24 (c).</text>
            <text syncTime="882.670" offset="3634030">And this is one of the main themes of our argument that there is a difference between a cash basis taxpayer and an accrual basis taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="892.141" offset="3671960">They are not on equal footing and they are not so treated by the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.022" offset="3699440">And in the Musselman case, they rejected the argument and refused to follow the cases of Eckert v. Burnet and Helvering versus Price which is the basis for the Commissioner's argument in those cases and also in the case before you today.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.295" offset="3776554">Following the Musselman Hub-Brake Company case, the Court in Anthony P. Miller versus Commissioner, which is a case following the example that I gave to you before, held that a corporation which transferred notes to its president within two and a half months after the close of the fiscal year of the corporation constituted payment under Section 24 (c) which is the predecessor to Section 267.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.074" offset="3887626">They felt that the delivery of the note completed the transaction and relationships between the parties changed as of that time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1917.404" offset="7772975">Mr. Chief justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.794" offset="7786559">As Mr. Schrager has indicated, the issue in this case is whether an accrual basis taxpayer delivers its promissory note to an employees' profit-sharing trust is entitled to a deduction under Section 404 of the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.874" offset="7854895">That statutory provision allows for a deduction for contributions to such trust a year end in which such contributions are paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.912" offset="7886973">That's the narrow issue in this case, it's whether the delivery of the note constitutes payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1952.347" offset="7912782">Consider -- excuse me, consideration of this issue is assisted by two limiting propositions on which there can be a little basis for disagreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.044" offset="7955519">The first of this is the normal accrual basis rules do not apply in determining whether there has been a payment under Section 404.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.728" offset="7990314">And the second is that under cash basis method of accounting, the delivery of a promissory note does not constitute payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.738" offset="8026363">These two propositions taken together do not completely dispose of this case, but they do considerably narrow the range of permissible debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.869" offset="8062830">I will therefore briefly explain why these propositions are sound and interned to the discussion of the area of disagreement that remains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.931" offset="8099088">The first proposition, as I have indicated, is that normal accrual basis rules do not apply in determining whether a contribution has been paid for purposes of Section 404.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.274" offset="8148511">The statute provides and I quote, “A taxpayer on the accrual basis shall be deemed to have made a payment on the last day of the year of accrual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.759" offset="8186441">If the payment is not made -- excuse me, is made not later than the time prescribed by law for filing the return for such year.”</text>

            <text syncTime="2044.897" offset="8282990">If accrual basis rules have applied, the deduction would always have been available for the year of accrual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.014" offset="8307440">No provision such as the one that I have just quoted would have been necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.159" offset="8324054">The Congress understood that such provision was necessary to permit an accrual basis taxpayer to take a deduction for the year of accrual if payment was not in fact made during that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.068" offset="8371597">And the provision applies, it should be noted, only with respect to payments made shortly after the end of the year in the two and a half month grace period.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.844" offset="8406706">Thus, it's plain that Congress understood and intended that the normal accrual basis rules do not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.120" offset="8439829">The second proposition is that the issuance and delivery of a promissory note by a cash basis taxpayer would not constitute payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.766" offset="8474415">This Court so held in Eckert against Burnet and Helvering against Price, and the lower federal courts have uniformly followed these decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.083" offset="8511718">The rationale of Eckert and Price is straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.678" offset="8526033">A cash basis method of accounting focuses upon movement, inflows and outflows of cash for its equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.655" offset="8558007">And the giving of a promissory note or an IOU does not affect an outflow of property, an outflow of cash for its equivalent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3398.115" offset="13695875">All these considerations, we submit, point toward the uniform application of cash basis rules under Section 404.</text>
            <text syncTime="3405.466" offset="13725236">The cash basis method of accounting affords a fair, objective, easily administrable set of rules to further the underlined statutory purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.924" offset="13763062">It was therefore reasonable for the Commissioner to construe the statute is requiring actual payment, cash or its equivalent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.677" offset="13790124">And we submit that this longstanding interpretation by the agency charged with the administration of the statute should be sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.038" offset="13823561">Now, petitioner's argument for a different treatment for special treatment for accrual basis taxpayers, rest almost exclusively upon an analogy to Section 267, a section which we believe is not relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.982" offset="13879254">Broadly speaking, that provision deals with transactions between related taxpayers, and those familiar example may be the wage expense incurred by an accrual basis corporation tying one of its cash basis shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.029" offset="13947486">Section 267 provides that the corporation is entitled to a deduction on account of the wages only if they are paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.781" offset="13982490">Now, early in the history of the predecessor of this provision, the lower federal courts in these circumstances held that the delivery of a note to the shareholder constituted payment because the note was income to the cash basis shareholder.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.957" offset="14047169">And in 1953, Congress amended the statute to ensure that deduction -- that the deduction would be available only if the income was in fact realized by the cash basis recipient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.595" offset="14101713">And after that amendment, the Commissioner acquiesced in the earlier decisions, but in doing so, explicitly distinguished between Section 267 and Section 404.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.419" offset="14149047">Well, this history does not support the petitioner's construction for Section 404.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.504" offset="14169422">The meaning of the term “paid” in Section 267 turns on the specific purpose of creating symmetry in the treatment of related taxpayers and that is the result that has been achieved.</text>

            <text syncTime="3532.487" offset="14233370">That's true, Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.665" offset="14242043">Now, the petitioner, in his reply to the belief, says, “Well, Section 267 and 404 really are similar because (b)(9) of 267 applies the certain charitable organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.801" offset="14290526">But the history or the purpose of Section 267(b)(9) as its legislative history plainly shows is to prevent the deduction of losses on the sale of property to a charitable organization controlled by the seller.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.611" offset="14353847">And the rationale of that provision is that since the seller attains effective control of the property, he should not be entitled to the benefit of a loss deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.980" offset="14391254">But that consideration lends nothing, sheds no light on the meaning of the term “paid” and either Section 267 or 404.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.995" offset="14431378">My final point is that the proper analogy here is not the Section 267 but to Section 170, which allows in language virtually identical to that of Section 404, a deduction for contributions paid to charitable organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.558" offset="14497625">The term “paid” is used in Section 170 as it is in Section 404 to ensure that the tax exempt recipient of the contribution will obtain a substantial present benefit, not just the promise of a future benefit as a the result of the transaction giving rise to the tax deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3618.044" offset="14575574">For that reason, Section 170 has always been interpreted as requiring more than the giving of a promissory note.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.003" offset="14603368">The same result for the same reason is appropriate here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.405" offset="14621027">Congress intended that the taxpayer should part for something more than its bear promise to part with something in the future for obtaining the benefit of a deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.250" offset="14660420">Now, petitioner gave only its promise, not as property, the judgment of the Court of Appeals denying the deduction should therefore be affirmed.</text>
