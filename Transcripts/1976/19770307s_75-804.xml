            <text syncTime="12.212" offset="149327">This case is here on certiorari from the Court of Appeals of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="17.224" offset="169389">The petitioner, a member of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, brought suit in state court against this union and some of its officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.517" offset="206587">He alleged discrimination with respect to job referrals in the hiring hall.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.929" offset="228217">He also claimed to have been subjected to a campaign of personal vilification and harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.213" offset="257369">In his state tort action, a jury awarded petitioner substantial damages on the theory under California law have intentional infliction of severe emotional distress.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.799" offset="315674">The California Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.655" offset="327064">It concluded that a state court had no jurisdiction to entertain petitioner's tort claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.391" offset="357993">It held that the National Labor Relations Act preempts this type of suit brought by a union member against the union and its officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.179" offset="401147">In an opinion filed today with the clerk of the Court, we disagree with the California Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.623" offset="430927">We do not think Federal labor law has preempted all tort claims under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.768" offset="459557">The opportunity for interference with the federal scheme of regulation is not sufficient in a case of this kind to conclude that Congress intended to vest exclusive jurisdiction in the Labor Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.872" offset="519952">In this case however, we do not reinstate the jury verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.937" offset="540223">We think the way in which this case was tried and particularly, the instructions to the jury did impose a risk of undue interference with the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.030" offset="600618">We therefore vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with our opinion.</text>
