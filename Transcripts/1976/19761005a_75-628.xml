            <text syncTime="1607.411" offset="6530342">Furthermore, just to run into my rebuttal time just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.908" offset="6552389">A discrimination based on sex is like race because it is an accident of birth which cannot be changed and for at least 99% of human activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.983" offset="6592618">It has absolutely no relationship to one?s character, ability, confidence, sobriety, or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.967" offset="6620621">Now, if race is going to be treated differently from sex, it can only be because in sex, there are some organic differences which for limited purposes might be relevant, and we have no analogy between the races.</text>
            <text syncTime="1641.498" offset="6666701">But for a non-organic discriminations like this I think it is indistinguishable for race and I ask this Court, although it is not necessary to this case because the statistics really would not pass even rational relationship muster, to maybe clear the air say that sex discrimination is not based on organic differences and can?t be treated the same as racial differences.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederick P. Gilbert</label>
            <text syncTime="3390.717" offset="13663547">Yes, very brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.307" offset="13681937">Your Honor, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.958" offset="13688520">On this question of standing my distinguished co-counsels offered me to invite your attention to two cases, Barrows v. Jackson in 346 U.S. and Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park in 396 U.S. that a white owner of real estate wishing to sell to Negroes does have standing to assert the equal protection rights of Negro vendees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.629" offset="13779217">And I think that is relevant to the question here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3422.708" offset="13791547">Hardly because that widens his market does it not?</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.374" offset="13802204">He has an economic interest.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederick P. Gilbert</label>
            <text syncTime="3426.832" offset="13808056">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.291" offset="13809832">Well, precisely here, it is the same thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.248" offset="13825715">Also on this question about the boys being able to get their liquors somehow, this is just part of the old thing in Oklahoma that dries have had their law and the wets have had their liquor kind of the gentleman?s agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.796" offset="13867929">But I will tell you who really is the loser in this game is the vendor who around election time can always expect to be rated by the local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.552" offset="13902933">That goes to the Stanton.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.715" offset="13911605">Now, getting intoxicated on 3.2, let me just say something factually from my own experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.760" offset="13947759">3.2 is so diluted that the normal man will get extremely bloated on the stuff before he can get drunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.047" offset="13976911">It is possible to get drunk but you have to force it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3475.715" offset="14003556">It is difficult to get drunk on 3.2.</text>
            <text syncTime="3481.004" offset="14024768">The question was made about sex in the LaRue case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.554" offset="14038978">That is a different kind of sex and what we have got involved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.461" offset="14050577">That sex is activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.837" offset="14056115">This sex is a biological grouping.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.880" offset="14068235">If this Court would have pulled the rule saying, you do not have to serve or you cannot serve liquor at a horse race, you would not say that the State under the Twenty-First Amendment can regulate the alcoholic race relationship because that is using race in a different sense than the normal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3507.047" offset="14128944">So that is why I am trying to explain the difference between sex in LaRue and sex here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.914" offset="14144409">It is the same word that they mean two different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.766" offset="14163739">These statistics -- I want to mention one thing, they all date from 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.984" offset="14184637">There are some dates from 1972 but they were not published until 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.648" offset="14199266">So this Court has liberated to take whatever inference it wants to what was or what was not before the legislature when this statute was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.481" offset="14250675">Okay, I just have one other thought, I leave you with the thought that sobriety differential of 1 or 2% in this case was far less than the business experience differential in Reed v. Reed or the dependent differential between husbands and wives and Frontiero at first and so forth, Frontiero v. Richardson.</text>
            <text syncTime="3559.633" offset="14339282">We are really dealing with something almost de minimis in the sobriety ratio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.106">To get the seeming imbalance, you have to juggle the statistics and try to discuss in my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.887">Well, I do not have time for parting thought I thank you for your time.</text>
