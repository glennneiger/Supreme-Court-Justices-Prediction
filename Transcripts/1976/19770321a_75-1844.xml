            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100566">Chief Justice Rehnquist: We’ll hear arguments next in 1844, United States against Lovasco.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.712" offset="255315">Mr. Rupp, I think you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. John P. Rupp</label>
            <text syncTime="43.182" offset="273288">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.611" offset="290946">The Government petitioned for a Writ of Certiorari in this case after a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit had affirmed the dismissal of three counts of the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.745" offset="331488">Unlike the District Court, the Court of Appeals based its decision on the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, holding that Respondent had satisfied with the majority characterized as the two basic elements essential to a claim of impermissible pre-accusation delay, unreasonableness on the part of the Government and prejudice to his ability to defend against the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.538" offset="426679">Because we believe the decision in this case to be incorrect and because that decision conflicts with the approach taken by several other Courts of Appeals on two reoccurring issues of substantial importance, we sought further review by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.063" offset="476729">I should like to begin this afternoon by outlining as briefly as I can the context in which the issues presented here arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.039" offset="516644">Respondent was indicted on March 6th, 1975 on three counts of unlawful possession of materials stolen from the mails and one count of dealing in firearms without a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.669" offset="571188">The indictment referred specifically to eight handguns that Respondent allegedly had processed and sold between July 25th and August 31st, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.293" offset="617686">Six days after his indictment, Respondent moved under Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Sixth Amendment to have the charges against him dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.402" offset="654153">He alleged in that motion that the Government had not obtained any information relating to the charges in the indictment after September of 1973, that the ensuing delay of approximately 18 months was unreasonable, that that delay had caused him to experience anxiety and concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.742" offset="739521">He did not claim that the delay had impaired his ability to defend against the charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.584" offset="762822">The parties stipulated at the outset of the hearing held on the motion to dismiss that a Postal Inspector had interviewed Respondent in September of 1973 about a series of thefts from the Terminal Railroad Association facility in St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.472" offset="826352">The parties also stipulated that investigation of the thefts had continued thereafter, but that the Government had discovered only one witness after September of 1973 who might have bolstered its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.207" offset="889359">Respondent attempted to support his claim that the Government had possessed sufficient evidence as of September of 1973 to warrant presenting that evidence to the grand jury by introducing a report that had been prepared by the Postal Inspector.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.145" offset="949128">That report described a series of purchases of semiautomatic handguns from two men in August and September of 1973, all of which had been stolen after mailing from the Terminal Railroad Association in St. Louis.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.295" offset="1009732">The report stated that the agents had traced the weapons to a man named Joe Boaz (ph) and that Boaz had admitted that he had obtained the weapons from Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.297" offset="1057693">The report further indicated that the Postal Inspector had interviewed Respondent in the presence of Respondent’s attorney on September 26th, 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.030" offset="1092592">Respondent, who was then working as a switchman at the Terminal Railroad Association and would not have had access to insured mail parcels in the normal course of his duties, admitted to the Postal Inspector that he had sold Boaz four or five weapons.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.609" offset="1151002">Respondent attempted to explain his possession on those guns by claiming that he had found them in a sack in the backseat of his automobile after having gone to the Terminal Railroad Association to visit his son, who worked there as a mail handler.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.865" offset="1207949">The report noted finally that although Respondent’s son had cashed four or five of the checks given by Boaz as payment for the guns, the Postal Inspectors had no direct evidence that Respondent’s son was responsible for the thefts.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.140" offset="1273046">Respondent testified at the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss that two possible witnesses on his behalf had died during the 18-month delay referred to in his motion, his brother and a man named Tom Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.502" offset="1326545">According to Respondent, his brother had died approximately one year before the hearing, had worked at the same place of business as Boaz and had been present when he had made arrangements by telephone to sell the guns to Boaz.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.710" offset="1379312">Respondent claimed that Stewart was his source for two or three of the guns and that Stewart had died approximately six months before the hearing; again, however, Respondent stated that he had not disclosed -- or, Respondent stated for the first time, rather, that he had not disclosed Stewart’s involvement earlier because of fear of retaliation from Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.502" offset="1466561">Respondent’s testimony obviously raised a number of questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.251" offset="1485474">For example, the fact that Respondent had told the Postal Inspector that he had sold Boaz only the guns he had found at the backseat of his car and no more was inconsistent with his assertion at the hearing that he had obtained two or three of those guns from Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.600" offset="1546914">Similarly, fear of retaliation from Stewart could hardly have accounted for Respondent’s failure to mention at the time he filed his Motion to Dismiss Stewart’s involvement, since according to Respondent Stewart had been dead at that time for approximately six months; and furthermore, at no time during the hearing on the Motion to Dismiss did Respondent indicate what exculpatory testimony his brother or Stewart might have provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.409" offset="1650150">Despite these problems, the District Court dismissed all counts of the indictment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="391.882" stopTime="393.964">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="391.882" offset="1668017">Who was the Judge, Mr. …</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_p_rupp" startTime="393.964" stopTime="1113.492">
            <label>Mr. John P. Rupp</label>
            <text syncTime="393.964" offset="1676377">Judge Reagan.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.596" offset="1686930">The Court based its dismissal on Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, finding that the Government had not adequately justified the 18-month delay referred to in the Motion to Dismiss and that Respondent had been prejudiced by the death of Tom Stewart, whom the Court characterized as a material witness on his behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.460" offset="1762372">A divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed dismissal of the possession counts and reversed dismissal of the count of the indictment charging Respondent with having dealt in firearms without a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.074" offset="1808765">Although the majority credited the Government’s explanation for the delay as stemming from an effort on its part to discover persons in addition to Respondent who may have been responsible for the thefts, the majority nevertheless concluded that the Government had not sufficiently justified the delay and then that delay was, therefore, unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.193" offset="1897268">The Court also accepted the District Court’s finding that Respondent had been prejudiced by the death of Tom Stewart, adding without any basis that were Stewart’s testimony available, it would have supported Respondent’s claim that he did not know that the guns had been stolen from the mails.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.761" offset="1963515">It may be worth mentioning, since Respondent has raised the matter, at least briefly, that there is no impediment to this Court’s reaching the issues presented in the Petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.010" offset="1996533">It is true that the thrust of the Government’s opening brief on appeal was not directed at those issues; but the reason for that was that the District Court had based its decision not on the Fifth Amendment, but on Rule 48 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which of course is not applicable to the pre-accusatory phase of criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.379" offset="2066019">Perhaps more importantly, as the opinions in this case made clear, the panel expressly considered the issues presented to this Court, relying ultimately upon a view of the Due Process Clause that the Government disputed on rehearing in that court and disputes before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.579" offset="2138848">The decision in this case imposes upon the Government, via the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, a duty of speedy accusation roughly equivalent to -- in some respects, more stringent than -- the speedy-trial obligations specifically imposed by the Sixth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.049" offset="2208752">The standard employed here for measuring the permissibility of pre-accusation delay cannot be squared with this Court’s decision in Marion.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.713" offset="2239368">Indeed, it renders that decision largely meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.593" offset="2254937">Our position with respect to cases of this sort remains what it was at the time Marion was decided:  that is, that the Due Process Clause is not violated by delay in the institution of formal criminal proceedings unless that delay was part of an effort on the Government’s part to prejudice the defense or perhaps, alternatively, was engaged in by the Government in reckless disregard of known risks of prejudice to the defense and actually caused such prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.466" offset="2374368">At the heart of the decision in Marion was this Court’s conclusion that the disabilities suffered by potential defendants did not, in the vast majority of cases, begin to compare with the disabilities suffered by those who are actual defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.086" offset="2436853">The potential defendant is not required to live under the stigma that almost inevitably attends formal public accusation.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.312" offset="2469768">The differences were even more dramatic in the case of defendants who are incarcerated prior to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.990" offset="2500488">Unlike the pre-accusatory period, furthermore, delaying formal accusation until the Government has completed its investigation may benefit the defendant and society in a variety of ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.456" offset="2558375">Investigation beyond the point of mere probable cause, for example, may result in the discovery of evidence exculpating the defendant, thereby avoiding unwarranted or ill-considered charges of criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.908" offset="2612187">It may lead to the discovery of ameliorating evidence and a discretionary decision not to prosecute.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.711" offset="2639355">It may lead to the discovery of evidence indicating that the person originally under suspicion probably also committed other crimes or that additional persons were involved, thus facilitating the resolution of related charges against all in a single proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.026" offset="2704661">It is often made possible the shortening of the time between formal accusation and trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.386" offset="2734022">These interests are far from insubstantial.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.865" offset="2748024">They cannot be ignored in assessing the scope of the Government’s duty under the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.912" offset="2772161">It is an exceedingly serious matter to immunize from trial one whom the Government has reason to believe is guilty of criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.387" offset="2814062">A remedy so stringent in our judgment should be reserved for those cases of affirmative governmental misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.102" offset="2840915">That is not to say that the Due Process Clause is never violated without proof of affirmative governmental misconduct; Brady and Agers stand to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.599" offset="2882920">But the remedy for violation of the Government’s duty to provide the defense with exculpatory testimony in a Brady or Agers context is not the very stringent remedy of dismissing all charges, immunizing the defendant from further prosecution, but remanding the case for a new trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.713" offset="2955332">I want to emphasize here as clearly as I can that so long as formal accusation is delayed pending further investigation, as it was in this case, we believe that delay can never be considered unjustified, should never be held to constitute a breach of the Government’s duties to a particular defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.754" offset="3035580">As Mr. Justice Powell pointed out in Watson, “Good police practice often requires postponing an arrest, even after probable cause has been established, in order to develop further evidence to prove guilt to a jury”; Hoffa is to the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.997" offset="3092527">As Mr. Justice Stewart has stated for the Court in that case:  “Law enforcement officers are under no constitutional duty to call a halt to a criminal investigation the moment they have the minimum evidence to establish probable cause, a quantum of evidence, which may fall far short of the amount necessary to establish guilt to a jury.”</text>
            <text syncTime="770.550" offset="3182702">We do not mean to suggest, however, that the public policies making delay in the institution of formal criminal proceedings, an inevitable and desirable part of the criminal process, necessarily eliminates all concern with the expeditious enforcement of the criminal laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.137" offset="3253023">There may be times -- hopefully, they will be rare -- when delay in formal accusation is the result of efforts on the Government’s part to prejudice the defense and such prejudice occurs. There may also be times -- we hope equally rare -- when the Government engages in delay in reckless disregard of known risks of prejudice to the defense and such prejudice occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.468" offset="3354378">As we acknowledged in Marion, the Due Process Clause is available to remedy abuses of those sorts, which injures society, as well as the criminal accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.846" offset="3395861">But in other than those rare cases, we do not believe that the Due Process Clause requires courts to consider the timeliness, on an ad-hoc basis, of criminal charges brought within the applicable statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.895" offset="3456047">As this Court pointed out in Untied States v. Ewell:  “Statutes of limitation stand as the primary guarantee against the bringing of overly stale criminal charges.”</text>
            <text syncTime="849.487" offset="3498470">They represent a legislative balancing of society’s interest in equitable law enforcement and the interests of potential defendants in being freed from having to defend themselves against charges of long-past criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.645" offset="3555103">To be sure, statutes of limitation were never intended to immunize from judicial scrutiny prosecutorial misconduct, however unfair, occurring within the applicable limitations’ period; but they do take into account the fact that the timing of decisions to prosecute should be or necessarily are affected both by the need to proceed with care and deliberateness and by a variety of institutional factors; the need to assign priorities, for example, to the prosecution of some cases rather than others.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.848" offset="3691880">A standard for measuring the permissibility of pre-accusation delay, such as that employed here, would involve the courts in the same process in which Congress is engaged in enacting statutes of limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.157" offset="3745170">More importantly, we believe the courts should avoid the kind of ad-hoc inquiry into the permissibility of pre-accusation delay that was engaged in here for a variety of eminently practical considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.655" offset="3807133">First, if the standard in this case were to be used widely, courts would be required in perhaps the majority of cases to attempt to determine the point at which the Government was obligated to take its case to the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.964" offset="3872334">Whether measured against the standard of probable cause or some other standard, a determination of that sort would involve nearly insuperable problems of proof.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.447" offset="3914339">Second, it would make little sense if the duty as so conceived were limited to Government prosecutors.</text>
            <text syncTime="961.908" offset="3948194">If the Due Process Clause is construed as embodying a prompt accusation requirement, that duty presumably would extend to Government investigators generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.133" offset="4005036">We believe that judicial efforts to supervise the conduct of criminal investigations by reviewing them at the behest of individual defendants would have very serious import for the administration of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.217" offset="4073373">Third, a prompt-accusation requirement would necessitate the holding of lengthy hearings, trial before the trial, in almost every case before the required determinations could be made with any assurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.561" offset="4126767">The prosecutor would have to document in detail the course of the investigation leading to the charges, and particularly if the hearing were held before the trial of the general issue, the prosecutor would have to provide a dress rehearsal of his case in an effort to show that the time consumed by the investigation was reasonable under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1026.632" offset="4207015">At the same time, the courts would be required to attempt to resolve in the context of the particular case a variety of essentially policy disputes that transcend the individual case, whether available prosecutorial resources were appropriately devoted to the prosecution in one matter rather than another, whether the importance of continuing an agent in an undercover capacity was more important than proceeding with the prosecution of the particular defendant whose involvement was known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.707" offset="4331358">It is no answer to suggest that delay for any of these reasons is avoidable and is therefore chargeable to the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.986" offset="4364481">In fact, they are relevant to determining under the Due Process Clause whether, in light of all the circumstances, the Government has proceeded consistently with shared notions of fair play and fundamental decency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.784" offset="4419652">We thus submit that the courts below erred in dismissing three counts of the indictment in this case on the basis of pre-accusation delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.131" offset="4457059">The indictment was returned within 20 months of the offenses charged, well within the applicable five-year statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.108" offset="4488928">Respondent neither alleged nor sought to show that the Government had delayed in order to gain an impermissible tactical advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.994" offset="4520484">Neither has Respondent ever suggested that the Government proceeded in reckless disregard of known risks of prejudice to him.</text>

            <label>Mr. John P. Rupp</label>
            <text syncTime="1130.562" offset="4622780">The first standard, the standard that we specifically suggested in Marion, the prosecutorial-misconduct standard, is to some extent a subjective test, and the evidence that would be needed to sustain it, at least to some extent, would be within the hands of the government, although the United States Attorneys or Assistant United States Attorneys responsible for delay could be, and I assume would be, called to the stand and asked to explain the reasons for the delay. I don’t think that we can assume that Government counsel would not answer those questions candidly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.465" offset="4770424">The second alternative, or perhaps supplemental standard, is a good deal more objective, the Government proceeding with known risks of prejudice to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.251" offset="4821519">Now, that standard and the evidence needed to sustain a case under that standard would not necessarily be within the exclusive control of the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.676" offset="4863211">If, for example, a defendant had communicated, as this Respondent did not, that evidence in his possession needed for any defense he might have to put on was disappearing and the Government, despite that knowledge, proceeded to delay or continued to delay, such evidence would go a long way toward making out a case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1394.817" offset="5679799">That is a decision to be made by the jury, and if the Government is 98% sure that someone is going to testify falsely and it will be difficult to overcome that testimony and it proceeds to delay with the full intent to prosecute at some later time when that witness may not be available, I think that that’s the kind of governmental misconduct the standard would encompass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.077" offset="5780840">But I also think that it would be encompassed by proceeding the risk alternative formulation; that is, the Government proceeding, despite its knowledge that the defendant suffers a very real chance of being prejudiced by any delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.351" offset="5861924">Now, in the event the defendant’s evidence is, in fact, in a process, evidence that the defendant feels is needed is in the process of disappearing, one of the things he can do, of course, is to contact the United States Attorney and inform him of that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1457.515" offset="5930574">In this case, Respondent could hardly have claimed that the Government proceeded recklessly with respect to the two witnesses he testified at the hearing would have been available earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.264" offset="6749565">Judge Reagan did not decide this case under Rule 48, Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.265" offset="6765552">He decided it merely on Fifth Amendment, the essentials as set forth in Marion that there was pre-indictment delay and subsequent prejudice to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1674.613" offset="6798989">I might say the Government has made all kinds of arguments about why they did not win this motion, and that’s what they are confronted with today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.188" offset="6837232">And Justice Marshall, when I talk about we should … the defendant has to give up all of his evidence to the Government and tell the Government what his case is going to be is sort of silly and nonsense, it’s contrary to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.720" offset="6887387">When the defendant came in with his witnesses to the trial court in the pretrial motion, he presented his evidence that two of his witnesses had died.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.445" offset="6922287">I know nothing in any kind of law in this country that says that a defendant has to signal his testimony to the Government about what his evidence was going to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.198" offset="6957291">The Government at no time asked for a delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.769" offset="6979547">They didn’t ask for a continuance to check out the veracity of the defendant’s statement to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1725.297" offset="7001699">They never said, “We don’t believe these two witnesses died and, therefore, we want to check it out and see whether or not they would support your statement, they would exculpate you in the commission of this crime of possession of stolen mail matter”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.888" offset="7056034">I might say the Government runs all over the turf here with respect to all kinds of allegations, because they said nothing in the pretrial motion; they were mute on why they failed to indict this man within 17 months and what they were doing.</text>
