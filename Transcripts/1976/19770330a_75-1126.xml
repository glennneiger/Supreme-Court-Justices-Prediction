            <label>Mr. George E. Feldmiller</label>
            <text syncTime="98.593" offset="494892">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.096" offset="508894">This case, which is here on certiorari to the Eighth Circuit, involves two general issues: First, the extent of the protection under the Establishment Clause and so far as whether a person can in effect to be taxed or forced to expand money or to be deprived of work coverage or non-discriminatory work rules so that another may practice his religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.144" offset="597084">Second, the proper application of two provisions of the 1964 Civil Rights Act in the context of Rule 52(a)’s fairly erroneous requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.737" offset="643477">The first provision under the Civil Rights Act is the 1972 Congressional Amendment, Section 701(j) and its forerunner the 1967 EEOC guideline both of which define religion and require an employer to reasonably accommodate all aspects of his employee’s religious observance and practice, as well as beliefs and I emphasize all beliefs, unless that employer can demonstrate an undue hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.766" offset="771581">The second provision of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Section 703(h) and that declares that it shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to apply different terms of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority or merit system provided that such differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate and incidentally there is no evidence in the record of any intention to discriminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.260" offset="889550">After a full blown evidentiary hearing in which seven witnesses testified, the District Court dismissed Mr. Hardison’s religious discrimination claim and entered its findings of fact that TWA had reasonably accommodated Hardison and that any further accommodation would have constituted an undue hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.986" offset="968440">Judge Oliver found that many of the stipulated facts were irrelevant and he referenced all of his findings to the transcript testimony of the live witnesses and he stated that he was impressed with the men, who are on the line handling the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.917" offset="1032179">The Eighth Circuit disagreed and decreed that Judge Oliver’s findings and facts were clearly erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.936" offset="1056212">Now, the basic facts of this matter can be succinctly and summarily stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.792" offset="1079617">Hardison was employed at TWA’s major Overhaul base in Kansas City, Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.867" offset="1099993">That base operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.024" offset="1124548">At the time he was employed in 1967, Hardison indicated that he would work shifts including weekends.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.499" offset="1154537">Upon his employment, he became a union member and he functioned in accordance with the bona fide seniority rights that governed all job assignments under the applicable collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.063" offset="1200721">Now, thereafter in the spring of 1968, Hardison began studying the religion known as the Worldwide Church of God.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.486" offset="1230396">In April, he wrote his supervisor, Mr. Everett Kussman, and he stated that he wanted special time off from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset because he sincerely believed that that was the Sabbath under his new religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.967" offset="1288388">Mr. Kussman immediately initiated a meeting with Mr. Hardison to talk about this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.121" offset="1317018">Kussman agreed to excuse time off for seven religious holidays, which Mr. Hardison had, none of which were the same as the contractual holidays under the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.382" offset="1366024">Mr. Kussman also agreed to the union seeking swaps or days off and in an attempt to find another job.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.681" offset="1395177">The report was made to Mr. Kussman that Mr. Hardison’s day-off requirements were too difficult to handle.</text>

            <label>Mr. George E. Feldmiller</label>
            <text syncTime="334.987" offset="1440421">Hardison was generally able to avoid Saturday work from April, the time he first met with Mr. Kussman, through March, 1969 or up to March, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.315" offset="1489740">He did in that interim worked some voluntary overtime work on his Sabbath.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.165" offset="1513146">Now, after a second meeting in September, 1968 between Hardison, Kussman and the union steward, Hardison was still able to avoid the Saturday work and he was fully accommodated in his religious practices because Mr. Kussman had been able to agree with the union consent that he could have his seven special holidays off.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.015" offset="1608545">However, in December of 1968, Hardison voluntarily transferred to a different shift in a different building, which was governed by different seniority requirements and seniority list.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.626" offset="1659013">At that time he left to security of being half way up the ladder in seniority to position where he was second from the bottom.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.699" offset="1691301">When he made this transfer, he knew that he could expect some work on a Saturday in the event of a vacation problem or the employee junior to him might be ill or something of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.824" offset="1739784">At the time, well he had no Saturday work up to March, 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.517" offset="1766533">At that time Mr. Kussman, the TWA supervisor, noticed a schedule change have been made which would require Hardison to work starting Saturdays on March 8th.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.213" offset="1809374">Mr. Kussman therefore initiated a meeting with Mr. Hardison; and brought in the union steward, Mr. Tinder, to see what roles or aspects of accommodation could be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.130" offset="1853051">Mr. Kussman once again agreed to waive the seniority obligations upon TWA under the collective bargaining agreement, but the union steward did not believe that that could be done and refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.996" offset="1904460">Mr. Hardison offered to work six days a week and that was acceptable to TWA but it was unacceptable to the union because of the 40-hour work rule that any work over 40 hours was subject to the overtime bidding rights of all other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.934" offset="1968199">The aspect of whether or not Hardison may have been able to work four days a week, may well have been discussed at this meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.659" offset="1999128">Mr. Kussman did not believe that he could allow Mr. Hardison to have a four day work week.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.979" offset="2020444">Because he needed people to work in TWA’s continuous operation requirements, he was the only person scheduled to work on the job on Saturdays after March 8th.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.822" offset="2063807">This was a job that had to be filled in order to respond to any emergencies which might occur at the overhaul base.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.855" offset="2099960">Mr. Hardison was not satisfied with the results of the March 8, 1969 meeting but he did not file a grievance although he knew he could do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="523.308" offset="2193688">Would you explain to me why the swap was not feasible and the reason I asked that question is apparently it must have been assumed when the company indicated willingness to consider giving him his special holidays that they probably betrayed why could never have been swapped yet.</text>

            <label>Mr. George E. Feldmiller</label>
            <text syncTime="537.407" offset="2250112">Well, the basic difference between the holiday situation, the seven holiday situations and the swap on the Saturday is governed by the realities, I think, of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.873" offset="2304029">For example, TWA had a contractual obligation that it would work a minimal overtime or a minimal weekend force at its overhaul base on the weekends.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.013" offset="2348541">Also, the people with the high seniority just preferred not to work on Saturdays.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.457" offset="2370275">So we had a very limited number of people that were realistically available for TWA at this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="735.634" offset="3042981">At any event when Judge Oliver saw the witnesses and when he rendered his decision, he took into account the fact that TWA had to consider the rights of other employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.613" offset="3090941">The problems of employee morale and grievance problems and problems in the event that TWA went further without union consent, he also took into account that all religious beliefs it would be burdensome upon the employer to have to take into account all religious beliefs of all employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.910" offset="3176101">He thought that seniority was an important right and that under Section 703(h) if that was not controlling that at least indicated the congressional intent to protect bona fide seniority rights and in fact Judge Oliver found that it was coincidental that the seniority provision in this case acted to in anyway hamper Mr. Hardison’s ability to work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1020.493" offset="4182442">I should first like to answer Mr. Justice Stevens’ question concerning why the least jobs could not have been put up for bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.096" offset="4216924">They could not have been put up for bid because neither party to the potential swap asked his job be put up for bid, neither was willing to vacate his job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.713" offset="4271363">Hardison testify at Pages 83 and 84 of the Appendix that he knew all about the procedure, it was probably possible for him to get into that midnight shift where he would not have to work on his Sabbath by bidding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.841" offset="4355895">But that job was not open because the fellow on the midnight shift had not indicated any willingness whatever to leave it, in fact, Hardison said he had no idea whether the fellow be even willing to swap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.181" offset="4409185">There had been no application by that man to leave his job, nor had there been one by Hardison and that is what triggers the bidding is the job vacancy, the record is clear that there was no job vacancy; one could have been created, had either one of these two employees chosen to create one by telling the company they want to leave it, neither have not been.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.691" offset="4539275">The difference is between,(a) I cannot work this Friday which is treated as an emergency situation and which sometimes has worked out and the recurrent or permanent situation which is clear must be handled by the bidding procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.787" offset="4635614">There is testimony that occasionally through the union relief committee things were worked out but there is no testimony that at any of those situations, the seniority rights of any intervening employee would have impaired.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.999" offset="4704473">In short, even a swap, so far as this record shows, could not have been accomplished if that swap had been over the objection of some other employee would have preferred to work that shift.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.544" offset="4754628">Now, here you had as many as 200 potential applicants for this job and it was obviously impossible for a continued period, here it was a minimal of three weeks and basically it was far more than that because Hardison was a permanent congruent presumably to this religion, he would constantly in any job that he had where he remained a senior man, come into the situations where he would be unwilling to perform to meet the job requirements of that job, which was attendance of work on the scheduled work day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.286" offset="4869671">The company treated it until as far as the record shows non-discriminatorily treat, as completely different situation on one day swap, the holidays, they were willing to do, they did.</text>
