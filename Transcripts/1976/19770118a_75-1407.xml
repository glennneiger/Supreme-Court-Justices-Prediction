            <label>Mr. John Dienner III</label>
            <text syncTime="61.927" offset="351065">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.935" offset="363081">My name is Johnny Dienner III.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.879" offset="370918">I am an Assistant State’s Attorney here representing the defendants below Morgan Finley, the Circuit Court Clerk and Richard J. Elrod, the Sheriff of Cook County.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.918" offset="419088">Mr. Bargiel, also with me here from the Attorney General’s Office and will be speaking for defendants, Trainor and O’Malley.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.257" offset="448449">This suit originated as a consequence of the Illinois Department of Public Aids having filed an action in the Circuit Court of Cook County wherein the plaintiff, the federal plaintiff, was the then State defendant and he was charged with having fraudulently concealed certain monies which he and his wife had in a credit union from the Illinois Department of Public Aid when they, the Hernandezs, applied for public assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.353" offset="576763">The amount that the Illinois Department of Public Aid asserted that they received that they were not entitled to was $3,720.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.291" offset="624515">The compliant in the appendix starting at page 15, sets forth the facts of this cause of action and the allegations and facts and support thereof may be found starting at page 15.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.279" offset="684492">Mr. Hernandez with his counsel came to the Circuit Court of Cook County and filed his appearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.491" offset="713331">When he found that the attachment action had been continued for a period of time pursuant to local Circuit Court of Cook County practice, they immediately came and filed the instant federal action in United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois Eastern Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.217" offset="784280">Their jurisdiction was based upon 42 U.S.C. 1983 and they sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the Illinois Attachment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.161" offset="823986">A Three-judge-panel was convened.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.937" offset="835166">The defendants filed, all defendants filed motions to dismiss and the plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.528" offset="861497">The classes were certified both plaintiff and defendant classes, and the three-judge-panel ultimately declared the operative sections of the Illinois Attachment Act to be unconstitutional as violative of Due Process rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.996" offset="923355">And the defendants, whom I represent, defendants Finley, Elrod, the Sheriff and Court clerk were enjoined from issuing and attaching pursuant to that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.840" offset="966719">A motion for stay was denied, notices of appeal were filed with jurisdictional statement raising all issues as to all defendants was likewise filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.706" offset="998170">The case was docketed and here we shall proceed.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.649" offset="1021994">Initially, I would like to speak briefly to the propriety of the class that was certified by District Judge Kirkland.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.078" offset="1059715">My defendants allege and assert that the plaintiff has failed to plead compliance with Rule 23 A3 in establishing the propriety of the plaintiff class.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.701" offset="1126170">There are allegations in that regard reflective on two counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.189" offset="1140172">First of all, while there is a conclusory allegation of irreparable injury as to all plaintiffs none has asserted factually in support of the class members.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.987" offset="1191372">There is no facts upon which the District Court could conclude that the class members excluding Mr. Hernandez suffered any irreparable injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.344" offset="1232750">And the second defect is that, some potential class members of the plaintiff class are also creditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.194" offset="1264097">In other words, any person, corporation or business entity could be an attaché as well as a person attempting to attach a debtors property and they therefore, would have no particular interest in the relief sought by the plaintiffs herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.898" offset="1322924">In fact, their interest would be quite to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="319.569" offset="1381648">While it was presented in the jurisdictional statement, did you raise these questions?</text>
            <text syncTime="323.665" offset="1398053">I don’t think you did.</text>

          <turn speaker="john_dienner_iii" startTime="324.340" stopTime="552.584">
            <label>Mr. John Dienner III</label>
            <text syncTime="324.340" offset="1400769">I don’t believe that the defect of the class was mentioned in the jurisdictional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.587" offset="1417697">No, Mr. Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.870" offset="1430862">There’s a consequence I believe that the class for relief was erroneously granted and because the entry of that order of certifying the class was of course, interlocutory order, it is not made final until the final order is presently before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.769" offset="1494497">I’d like to speak briefly as to the issue of abstention as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.410" offset="1509021">This being of particular concern to my clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.029" offset="1527515">My clients believe that the Federal Courts are undoubtedly the ultimate guarantors of all person’s federal rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.392" offset="1560952">They do however assert that the State Courts are the primary guarantors and this must be so for obvious reasons, otherwise, every federal issue conceivably could be raised by any plaintiff or defendant in any typical state action tort, contract and the like, would have to first come to the Federal District Court, be decided on a constitutional issues remanded to the Circuit Court of Cook County or any other State Court for further trial on the issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.479" offset="1681324">Now this of course, relegates the State Courts, in my opinion, to the role of perhaps masters in chancery to the Federal District Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.589" offset="1709746">And this is quite antagonistic to our obviously alleged violations of comity and federalism in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.750" offset="1754363">As a matter of fact, the Illinois Supreme Court within the last month decided a case, it was tax injunction suit, 28 East Jackson and in that case the Court made query as to whether or not they were not in fact becoming masters in chancery to the local District Court but of course, made that observation in passing.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.300" offset="1852583">Now, the two exceptions that will allow a Court to override the basic premises of comity and federalism as one there is either a bad faith enforcement of state laws not at issue here and never alleged or when the statute is violative of expressed constitutional provisions in every clause, paragraph, and sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.262" offset="1940459">Now, there were no such allegations of bad faith enforcement and of course the judge, the three-judge-court did not find the violation on every clause, sentence, and paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.135" offset="1991868">As a consequence, the District Court, in its failure to properly take account of comity and federalism as raised and specified more accurately in the Huffman and Younger decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.852" offset="2054771">The consequences of that action, it results in 204 State of Illinois officials being enjoined from acting pursuant to a lawfully enacted state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.408" offset="2112972">A 102 of those State Officials are County Sheriffs, each of whom is charged with the duty of maintaining peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.719" offset="2154245">We submit that the creditors as a result of being denied the opportunity to use the Court systems and the Attachment Act what we resort to self-help was available under common law and uniform commercial code and contract provisions also that may permit self-help.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.737" offset="2238360">Thereby, establishing a far greater risk of breaches of peace.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.422" offset="2261034">To this of course, the Sheriffs have a particular interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.323" offset="2276707">This federal action by our local District Court was made prior to any State Court determinations or interpretations of the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="606.614" offset="2529782">Now, this leaves creditors with a lack of full and complete remedies and of course this Court in the other prejudgment garnishment type of actions it was recognized, The creditors have no fewer rights certainly than debtors and the balance must be struck between the two.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.291" offset="2624554">And we assert, of course, that that balance was struck in the situation and that the Federal District Court and their action was totally unwarranted in this regard and has unnecessarily interfered with matters of special state concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.846" offset="2698742">As to issues of state remedies available and the like I at this point, if it please the Court will defer to Mr. Bargiel who will speak for the Attorney General’s office.</text>

            <text syncTime="697.402" offset="2892988">In the brief time allotted to me, I would like to take a very simple and straight-forward position on behalf of my clients.</text>

            <text syncTime="755.851" offset="3126732">No, not that they just happen to be the facts in this case but where the state is bringing the cause of action and they’re doing so in support of a valid and legitimate state purpose, it seems to me that the principles which underlying comity and federalism are obviously more appropriate than where the plaintiff in a lower court action, a private citizen bringing an action against another private citizen and I think that is a first statement of some of the decisions of this Court in recent times.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.023" offset="3247417">The exceptional circumstances under which a plaintiff in a Federal District Court can ask for an injunction, this Court has indicated that as being demonstration or showing that there are some sort of bad faith on behalf of the state bringing the action, I suppose one example of bad faith is a demonstration that the purpose of bringing the action on behalf of the state is to harass the individual defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.021" offset="3343444">There’s been no allegation in the plaintiff’s complaint seeking injunctive relief, that there is any bad faith purpose on behalf of the State of Illinois, that it's purpose is to harass. There was no finding by the three-judge court in its order of memorandum opinion, that the state was acting in bad faith and that its purpose was to harass.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.202" offset="3424214">And in fact, no such showing can be made because the purpose which the State was actuated by in this case was to recover welfare funds which were dispersed to the Federal Court plaintiff pursuant to a request for funds wherein he lied and secreted certain assets which he had.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.949" offset="3515120">There are two affidavits in the record in the appendix, I should say, I think which demonstrate reasonably clearly that the Federal Court plaintiff here was in fact in all probability or the reasonable inferences that he was guilty in fact of welfare fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.666" offset="3606026">The affidavits appear at if I’m correct page 15 and 17 of the record, appendix, I’m sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.170" offset="3640090">And let's see, I apologize page 52 and 53 of the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.151" offset="3736012">On In page 52, there’s an affidavit of an employee of the company at which the Federal Court plaintiff had his credit union, wherein he says that the Federal Court plaintiff, Mr. Hernandez, here has accumulated a certain amount of money in the credit union and he has an account which has been open from January 3, 1972 and they had a balance on him of $1,193.00 on November 30, 1974, this is in paragraph 3 of the affidavit at page 52.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.725" offset="3882297">There is an affidavit at page 53 of an employee of the Illinois Department of Public Aid wherein the employee of the department indicates that Mr. Hernandez received public assistance for the same period and in fact set on his application that he was unemployed and he had no assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.390" offset="3960978">So, it appears to me quite clear that the State was actuated by a valid and legitimate state purpose in this particular case and that in which is that of combating welfare fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.481" offset="4005282">The other circumstance, exceptional circumstance, under which a plaintiff might be entitled to injunctive relief to restrain a pending State Court proceeding from going forward is as Mr. Dienner pointed out, in a situation where the plaintiff can show that the statute in question is patently and flagrantly violative of a constitutional prohibitions in every clause, sentence, phrase, and against whomever it may possibly be applied to, I would suggests that there are; First, that the statute here on attachment act has never at least, it's validity has never been construed by the Illinois States Supreme Court and we would submit to this Court that there are saving constructions and applications which would result in its validity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.724" offset="4222307">And one suggests that the application of the statute which we submit would result in a finding that would be constitutional, involves on page 29 of the appendix, the application of section 2 which talks about an affidavit in the statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.731" offset="4314258">It says, “in all action sounding in tort where the underlying obligations sounds in tort that before an attachment shall issue upon the affidavit of the attachment creditor, that the attachment creditor has to appear before a judge and it says, before--I’m reading on page 30 of the appendix, it says “Before the writ of attachment shall be issued, the plaintiff his agent or Attorney shall apply to the judges of the Circuit Court of the county in which the suit is to be brought or is pending and be examined under oath by such judge concerning the cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.817" offset="4458663">So, it is clear that even though there is no notice before the attachment takes place where the underlying action sounds in tort that the judgment creditor would have to or attachments creditor would have to appear before a judge and be examined concerning his cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="3082.856" offset="12434787">The itemized statement of his account indicates that on that date he had $55.00 in his credit union account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.924" offset="12463104">Now under Illinois Law, fraud cannot be alleged in a conclusory fashion, except in the Illinois Attachment Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.792" offset="12490585">When you file a compliant for fraud, you have to allege specific factual allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.348" offset="12512737">You have to allege misrepresentation of a specific fact, scienter intent to deceive, materiality of the allegation, reliance and damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.200" offset="12552129">If the attachment creditor had been required to allege those specific facts and to present that to a judge or any other officer who knows what the law is in Illinois, this attachment would never have been issued because a person who applies for public aid can have more than $55.00 in assets at the time he applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3136.725" offset="12650245">So that, if they had alleged the specific allegation that he said he didn’t have anything and he really has $55.00.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.717" offset="12686190">They couldn’t allege materiality because he would have gotten the money anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3149.861" offset="12702804">The record also shows that Mrs. Hernandez didn’t even have a credit union account at that time and furthermore that she wasn’t the person who applied to public aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.893" offset="12738957">Therefore, she made no misrepresentations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.652" offset="12749928">So therefore, if the specific facts would have had been plead in the State Court to a judge based on their own evidence in the record there wouldn’t have been an attachment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.014" offset="12791411">Yet, because of the fact that you cannot get an attachment by filing an affidavit with conclusory allegation of fraud presented to a Court clerk, who really stamps that affidavit and sends summarily onto the sheriff, they were able to deprive these persons and all other persons--and all other creditors are able to deprive all of the persons similarly situated of their property without due process of law.</text>
