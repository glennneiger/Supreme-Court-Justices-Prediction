            <text syncTime="90.805" offset="464133">Actually, only Section 3332 (2) (a) is involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.907" offset="492554">That is the provision that requires that on filed official New York State descriptions, the names and addresses of patients be contained thereon, and be filed with the New York State Department of Health whose commissioner is the Appellant herein.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.135" offset="573429">The District Court enjoined this statute on the basis that this provision was an invasion on privacy of the appellees who are anonymous, basically anonymous patients and known doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.238" offset="645840">I would allude to the operation of the other sections which were enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.648" offset="663499">They require the use of the official New York State description in prescribing these certain dangerous drugs, and this applies to doctors and pharmacist in the State of New York.</text>

            <text syncTime="182.806" offset="832146">So therefore, the doctor or pharmacist does have to keep these records and the statute so provides for a period of five years they have to keep these records.</text>

            <text syncTime="395.858" offset="1684260">A lot of these drugs are prescribed by doctor studies have been made for causing medical uses for rather fallacious reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="959.362" offset="3938314">Yes, I think quite seriously they will be in great jeopardy and perhaps more important than I -- I think it was my first point about the bad policy of a finding a doctor-patient relationship been in of itself as a fundamental interest is that as I think Your Honors are all aware, the doctor-patient privilege finds its expression in law in confidentialities provided for only in state laws, New York does provide for doctor-patient testimonial confidentiality.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.545" offset="4063075">Now, it was not known even at common law, and indeed there are many variations on this privilege and furthermore, commentators have criticized the privilege because many times it prevents courts from getting at the truth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.473" offset="4118768">What it should be emphasized is that it is not necessary for medical treatment for there to be a confidential relationship between doctor and patient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.584" offset="4155235">I think this case demonstrates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.013" offset="4172893">There are allegations or I would say the record shows the testimony of the patients, that they stopped using Schedule II because of the filing requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.843" offset="4220227">Well, let us look at what happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1033.648" offset="4235483">A patient goes to the doctor, he tells the doctor what ails him, the doctor than makes a diagnosis and determines on a course of treatment, in its complete discretion or his decision, he may decide on a Schedule II drug, and it only at that point does he write a prescription, how I ask you had the practice of medicine been interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1053.239" offset="4313850">The practice of medicine has not been interfered with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.418" offset="4326598">In the 30 years there is no record of it in California, the 15 years in Illinois, and I think about 10 or 12 years in Idaho with the same type of filing and reporting has been enforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.248" offset="4385844">Now, as we said, I said the problem of situation is doctor to doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1076.403" offset="4406533">Now, as to patients what the purpose of the statute, the patients who gets from a doctor an over 30-day supply, now this would more probably be the abuse of the patient by the doctor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.287" offset="4465987">Now, obviously we can still printout as we do, we could still printout prescriptions, anonymous prescriptions -- there is anonymous list of patients that contain over 30-day supply which is a violation of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.014" offset="4524919">However, what we can not know is, is this one person receiving the multiple prescriptions from the same doctor or what?</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.696" offset="4559610">All we can do now is get a list of perhaps a hundred, a thousand of these types of prescriptions to come through each month and send out investigators back to the drugstore to find out who was the patient to find out which are the most serious cases of abuse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.418" offset="4614572">It is absolutely impossible to do with 24 investigators in the whole State of New York.</text>

            <label>Mr. A. Seth Greenwald</label>
            <text syncTime="1139.881" offset="4660443">Yes, as quite specifically under the Triplicate Prescription Law, a doctor is limited to prescribing a 30-day supply with several exceptions, I believe, some of the drugs with children, I think I believe the Ritalin they maybe able to prescribe the 3-month supply, but basically there is a limitation of a 30-day supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.374" offset="4750408">In point of fact the exception for I think 3-month would depend on knowing the age which we are trying to be reported and the drug and the patient, for example, to know whether that was being complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.059" offset="4801086">Now, another point or another purpose is that basically filing a triplicate prescription with patient names heightens the doctor’s awareness to the status of his patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.994" offset="4852808">There is of course, and it was said -- well defense lawyer has no application to addicts, which is true, in the sense that the law prohibits prescribing this type of Schedule II dangerous drugs to addicts and the habitual users.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.023" offset="4912995">But how are we going to know whether that is being complied with unless we know or have some record of who are receiving them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.984" offset="4944759">Another major problem I would submit is, if the names and addresses are missing from the filed prescriptions, a doctor could prescribe for himself with little danger of detection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.294" offset="4990004">He could use false names, his own name, whatever name he feels like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.937" offset="5004632">He could make sure it is within under 30-day supply because he has these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.977" offset="5044756">I would also say, and it is rather obvious from your own cases I think the Moore case which I am not acquainted with that there are unscrupulous doctors and pharmacists who are basically dispenses a drug at will.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.231" offset="5097837">Now and finally you have the question of forgery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.859" offset="5116332">Now it is true the computer cannot in and of itself identify a name as a forgery but, and this is of course I think which cases have come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.690" offset="5159590">Usually forgeries when you have a forgery, the person who is using a false name does it in a rather large amount, just like when you print up counterfeit money you do it in the amount to make it worthwhile, and normally because it is a false name it is a same name.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.545" offset="5211104">Now, if we do not know the name there is no way to, say, send out the alert that someone using the name of such and such is active in your area, if you get a prescription in that name.</text>

            <text syncTime="1483.556" offset="6035110">The District Court clearly found such a privilege from its reading of the abortion in Roe and Doe cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.673" offset="6063532">I believe that those decisions did know such thing that it was a misreading of those decisions, but I think that - and as I have emphasized - that it would be improper to so do, there are valid policy reasons not to and I do not think that had been at all answered by my adversary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.959" offset="6132704">This Court also has declined in any number faith just as last term to extend any right of privacy, such as or I would say going back one last term but in the Planned Parenthood of Missouri v. Danforth, even in abortion context reporting abortions with names and dresses would not violate a patient’s privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.570" offset="6231133">California Bankers Association v. Shultz, no violation of right of privacy in reporting bank records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.906" offset="6256524">Perhaps the most obvious one is that income tax reporting is well-known and many people some expectation of privacy in that area, but for the operation of income tax laws and/or I submit also a drug control program, you have to have these reports, and it does not make any difference, whether the statute is been properly administered.</text>

            <text syncTime="1592.928" offset="6472609">Now, the appellees, the patients here were totally ignorant of this law, what it really was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.259" offset="6505942">They have thought that their record is going to be available to the police, to the army, to the Bar Association, that they were going to be maintained for ever and ever, and that is simply was not and is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.382" offset="6558395">And a fear of hypothetical stigmatization has never been held to state a course of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.252" offset="6589847">Only this past term, this Court held in Paul v. Davis that even if, what they fear, these appellees fear, disclosure of their drug records actually had occurred, there would not be any invasion of any of a federally protected right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.322" offset="6654213">Indeed, their protection comes from the very statute they are attacking, Section 3371.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.943" offset="7520642">Yeah, that was on that basis that they went to the Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals sent the case back to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.416" offset="7550526">The principle argument that they made was that there was a doctor to doctor problem here namely that patients using the same name would go to more than one doctor in order to obtain the elicit supplies of these drugs.</text>

            <text syncTime="2554.808" offset="10320133">What happened in this case was originally Judge Carter dismissed the case for one of the substantial federal questions and then went opt to the Circuit Court of Appeals and Judge Friendly instituted a temporary restraining order or continued the one the Judge Carter granted in effect held that there was substantial federal question and quoted the Poe v. Ullman case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.430" offset="10398604">He then sent it back down for arguments on the preliminary injunction motion and it was only after we have established in the record in this case all of the facts that I am talking about now, but then the case came up to this Court with a full record where it is shown that there is no need for this system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.899" offset="10500482">I believe we have also shown that the Federal Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act has no triplicate prescription provisions Uniform Controlled Substances Act has no triplicate prescription, Provision 39 says that the Union has no such provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.068" offset="10585119">This Court has often held that where so many other states have no triplicate prescription or have no comparable provision in their statute that is also an indication that those provisions are unnecessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.828" offset="10648230">The fact is in this case that there has not been a scintilla of evidence and Mr. Greenwald for the State has not pointed too a scintilla of evidence that there was any need whatsoever for the patients’ names.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.671" offset="10711551">If there were some showing of need as there is not in this at that point the State may well condition use of a more effective mean which involves the danger to constitutionally protected privacy on the taking of all reasonable precautions which limit the risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.530" offset="10783022">So that is the point where the adequacy of the State Security System comes into place Justice Rehnquist in response to your prior question, but we do not reach to that point in this case and the Three-Judge Court did not reach it in this case because there was absolutely no showing.</text>

            <label>Mr. H. Miles Jaffe</label>
            <text syncTime="2692.428" offset="10870585">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.461" offset="10878735">If I could go back to Mr. Justice Rehnquist’s question, we do admit that it is the difference in the extent and intrusiveness of the system that is the heart of this case, and the case really does not take off from the concurring opinion of Mr. Justice Powell in the Shultz case, where he says “At some point governmental intrusion upon these areas would implicate legitimate expectations of privacy.”</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.179" offset="10985628">The key to this case is that unlike the decisions in Danforth or in Shultz where the reporting was not systematic and in fact was not properly challenged or as in the American Physicians case which was affirmed by this Court in the last term but not heard by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.833" offset="11064204">There is systematic reporting here of the names of literally hundreds and thousands of patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="2748.620" offset="11095342">It is our belief, there comes a point at which the demand of the state for systematic reporting of absolutely innocent conduct becomes offensive, and in fact the intrusiveness of the conduct was seen at trial, because as Mr. Lesch’s comment this case went up and down, originally Judge Carter thought there was not substantial federal question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.982" offset="11184786">It was reversed by the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.287" offset="11190010">It came back down.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.804" offset="11196070">We asked for a temporary injunction and the Court said, no you have not shown us any real injury, but when we finally got to trial the witnesses who testified, testified to substantial intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship which is a part of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.652" offset="11267437">It is the intimacy of the information that government is seeking part of the doctor-patient relationship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.888" offset="11288439">Witnesses testified -- these witnesses it is true were innocent of past practices but they testified that the thought of having the State have all this information made them very uneasy or a doctor testified that he would not prescribe for his schizophrenic in one case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.594" offset="11367225">I think that is Page 169 in record Dr. Bernice’s testimony, he would not prescribe for his schizophrenic patient these drugs because as all the other doctors testified, he felt he was required to inform the patient that the system existed and him name would be forward to Albany.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.168" offset="11441517">He then felt that he is so informed this schizophrenic that would upset the very treatment which he in fact intended to prescribe for the schizophrenic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.021" offset="11480910">So, here we are asking the Court to address itself to the questions which were not raised in Danforth or Miller where there was investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2856.869" offset="11528348">But the question where there is in effect the Dragnet before and not in investigation afterward and that is the distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.025" offset="11556978">It is fine for the State to investigate and we are for it and we do not believe that drug abuse is a good thing we can say it is a bad thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.357" offset="11586340">Now, we think doctors should have to report and we do think that doctors should in fact -- the computer can print out exactly what the doctor’s uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.958" offset="11628658">That is to say if one doctor is prescribing hundreds of thousands of pills a month that whatever would be the right, a quantum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.469" offset="11658751">You can then go and investigate that doctor and the doctor is requiring a statute, and we do not objected it, the doctor is requiring the statute to keep those records and then when the State goes and conducts the investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2910.655" offset="11743493">What is challenged in this case is the centralization and the data processing implications that are taking place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.473" offset="11770764">In this case whether it be medical information, the next we will have is income, in the Valeo case we have political contributions for which a reason was found there which we think was compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.846" offset="11820293">The difference here is that the State’s showing is totally inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2934.124" offset="11837324">We may, the next case we may get is the filing of first of all fingerprints which is true, if we ask any single citizen to come forward at anytime we could probably get his fingerprints.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.346" offset="11878284">It is a systematic, dragnet, prior to any criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.026" offset="11909004">We have totally innocent patients here who are compelled to be part of the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2957.161" offset="11929484">No one goes to get a Schedule II drug because he wants to be happy about it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3210.674" offset="12943558">Yes I do, but here we have a showing after trial which is the difference in this case that the State has gotten literally nothing after trial, shown nothing as the (Inaudible), and we say as Mr. Justice Powell implicated into the Shultz case, there comes a point when the material turned up by a system which includes hundreds of thousands of prescriptions per month almost when it is going too far, and as Your Honor points out where you find any immediate need as in the income tax area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3245.833" offset="13084201">We would then uphold the system, where for example, you might even fill in the income tax place you went too far as in requiring everybody to report every check that he has and it is true that the IRS could get every check.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.618" offset="13139372">But we would still not want the government to have a record of every check, and checks or less personal if one looks at most than are the medical records of people here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.059" offset="13185138">Interestingly in the Danforth case, in the Shultz case and in the Association of American Physicians, none of the regulations required the centralized reporting of names.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.935" offset="13228606">Thus the statute of Danforth does not require the central reporting, and the regulations do not include on the form the name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.213" offset="13265700">That is the distinction that we called to the Court’s attention an urge, and we urge the Court to examine carefully the findings of the lower court and their narrowness perhaps not the language but the narrowness of that point, which said where there is no product from the system and where the system is requiring the massive centralization there we think that the diminution of constitutionally protected right is too great.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.727" offset="13375832">Or put otherwise, when you have regulation of this sort precision must be touched up.</text>

            <text syncTime="3330.317" offset="13422121">Yes, I think I did reserve a couple of minutes and I wish to emphasize that the counsel for the Roe appellees stated that into departmental communication it allowed under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.771" offset="13480008">That is basically erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.630" offset="13487427">The confidentiality provision in this law once again ignored, but District Court provides that patient identity is only available to the Department of Health to investigate as people who are responsible for the enforcement of Article 33 or other agencies that license people who deal in these controlled substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.276" offset="13573945">But the example given by the Attorney for the patient appellees about the Governor getting information is absolute nonsense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.100" offset="13609262">The Governor would be violating the law if he went to get this information, and I think I can fairly state that under this law the Commissioner of Health who I admitted to the point the Governor, has a legal duty and a legal right to sell the Governor -- this again happened once again a hypothetical -- to get out of his office, and of course, all this is in the height of hypothesis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.549" offset="13735068">Now, I also would like to emphasize that the confidentiality provision here is one of the most carefully drawn I think under analysis, and when you speak about income tax record, indeed the reason you speak, you find leaks perhaps of income tax record is, that the law allows those records that he provided to any government official.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.488" offset="13834856">This is not the case in the operation of our filing triplicate prescriptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.427" offset="13862546">There is also this factor of lack of results, claim of one or two in 20 months of operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.691" offset="13887623">In point of fact and I think I have found it in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.594" offset="13903297">In point of fact we did not have the capability of printing out patient names, of extracting patient names from the computer until about roughly August, 1974 and there was a trial in December.</text>
            <text syncTime="3462.507" offset="13950944">I think it is irrelevant to the constitutionality of this Section whether we have got one report, 50 reports, or 150 reports, but basically you had a system in its infancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.179" offset="13989605">There are of certain priorities in the Department Of Health.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.707" offset="13999741">Constitutionality of a statute on its face - and that is what we are involved here -- can not depend on the efficiency of proper operation by the appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.701" offset="14035685">Indeed, as I have cited in my Reply Brief, if there had been a preliminary injunction, let us say, for example grants against this system and there was one for about four or five or six months, you would have no results to discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.522" offset="14099006">It is rather obvious that the constitutionality of this statute depends on whether it is reasonably directed to accomplishing its purpose the discussion --</text>

            <text syncTime="3524.612" offset="14199316">It has been mentioned by the amici curiae brief, because it is rather obvious that the record in later months showed we were getting all types of reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.940" offset="14232648">But I submit that that is a totally erroneous test of constitutionality.</text>
