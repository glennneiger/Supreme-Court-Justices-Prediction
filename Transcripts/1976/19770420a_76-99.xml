            <text syncTime="50.806" offset="303662">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the court, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held below, that the EEOC has infinity within which to sue on an individual charge of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.984" offset="388403">In other words that there is no time limitation whatsoever upon that agency, a position advocated by the EEOC to that court, the Ninth Circuit so held in the context of a suit, alleging wide ranging practices and acts of sex discrimination against both females and males.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.821" offset="515776">A suit that was predicated upon a single charge of discrimination filed by one individual female protesting her discharge which she claimed to be discriminatory and that discharge occurred some three years and four months prior to the date upon which the EEOC got into the Federal District Court with its complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.133" offset="641060">Now it is petitioner’s position that infinity is not and can not be the only parameter on the EEOC’s right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.153" offset="701141">First it is our position that inherent in the statute itself is a 180 day limitation on the right to sue granted to the EEOC by that statute and secondly, it is our position that if in fact there is no federal limitation, then the most analogous state statute of limitation governs the EEOC’s right to bring suit.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="437.613" offset="1850947">But arguably, it might run from the -- according to that government’s allegation that it was going on at the time of the suit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Dennis H. Vaughn</label>
            <text syncTime="446.162" offset="1885115">Mr. Justice Stewart, I think it should be recognized that nowhere in the pleadings before the District Court, did the EEOC at any time argue that there was a continuing violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.377" offset="1937987">Furthermore, that argument came into this proceeding for the first time, in a reply brief it was filed to the Court of Appeals through the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.433" offset="1990232">It does not appear, I do not believe in the brief filed by the agency or by the Solicitor General with this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.083" offset="2020847">But in any event, it was raised for the first time belatedly on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.368" offset="2057941">Now, with respect to the 180 day Federal Limitation, that limitation is found in section 706 Act I of the act, when it is read in the context of the legislative history, certain portions of which I would like to highlight to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.226" offset="2137354">Senator Dominick who was the principal spokesman for the bill that ultimately has the senate referred to the 180 day provision as “The time period within which the commission may file a civil action” and Senator Javits referred to it as “The allowable time for the commission to move into a given situation.”</text>
            <text syncTime="537.581" offset="2250830">Now, these were not the only two comments, throughout the legislative history there was the very strong expression by Congress that the 18 months, the two years that it was taking the EEOC then to act was unfair to charging parties was a denial to them of justice, justice delayed is justice denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.099" offset="2356887">A phrase seen throughout the legislative history and there was a determination, a very strong conviction, that the same delay and in action by the agency was unfair to respondents and there was a clear Congressional determination in 1972, that this situation had to changed in order to prevent it from continuing.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.953" offset="2468273">Now the EEOC has struggled to breath some meaning into this language, the 180 day language as an alternative to our interpretation and thus the EEOC has argued that because Congress was aware in 72 that it took a year or two for the EEOC to dispose those charges because there was a backlog that Congress couldn’t possibly have intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.167" offset="2601184">The 180 day provision as a suit limitation and then according to the EEOC the 180 day provision is simply an expression of a private filing restriction on the individual victim of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.825" offset="2679760">But this position necessarily flounders, both on the expression of Congressional intention, but also on logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.492" offset="2726467">For this position of the EEOC assumes, first of all that Congress intended to build a system in 1972 that would perpetuate, that would build into the system forever more the very delays that if abhorred and was attempting by the new mechanism to eliminate and secondly the EEOC’s position assumes that Congress made the deliberate choice to extend the period during which a victim of discrimination could not sue himself or herself even though Congress knew full well that the EEOC during that period would not or could not do anything for that victim of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.658" offset="2935133">In others words Congress in 1972 took the former 30 to 60 day restriction on an individual filing suit and extended it to 180 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.532" offset="2982572">Now did Congress extended just to restrain the individual from being able to pursue his own rights, if it knew that the EEOC couldn’t or wouldn’t do anything, it simply doesn’t make sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.480" offset="3050385">It is an anonymous and incongruous intention to attribute to Congress and clearly at odds with their manifest intention.</text>

            <text syncTime="827.080" offset="3408785">Mr. Justice Stevens, the question you are asking me is what are the conditions to make some suit by a private individual and that of course is not a question before the court in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1239.917" offset="5060142">Part of the great problem with the inaction of the EEOC is that quite frankly from an employer’s point of view he can take a charge, he can sweep it under the rug because nobody is asking him or requiring him to make any sort of decision whatsoever and under the rug it sits and it languishes and he is never required to make a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.010" offset="5180514">Now did I make a mistake?</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.918" offset="5188142">Did I violate the law and what should I do about it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.631" offset="5199009">And these cases become much harder to settle quite frankly, five and six and seven years down the road, when there is a substantial back pay liability involved, then they are if you hit them right upfront.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.825" offset="5259822">Now, obviously charging parties would be benefited, charging parties now have their charges languishing before the EEOC, action is not taken, the EEOC goes out, they have a charge filed by an individual alleged discriminee, let's say a racial charge at first the EEOC does not do anything about it and then it does go out to conduct an investigation, but then it starts investigating, whether there is religious discrimination or sex discrimination, whatever else in addition to the particular charge of racial discrimination or minority status discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.601" offset="5438918">In the meantime the charging party sits and all the while the EEOC does not issue the 180 day notice, that that charging party has a right to sue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.145" offset="5481027">So he is not or she is not pursuing individual rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.626" offset="5502970">It is a very unfair system to charging parties, it is a very unfair system to respondents to employers and it is a terrible system and so far as the courts are concerned because the courts are being clogged with stale, time consuming cases going back years and years and years.</text>

            <text syncTime="1522.756" offset="6191558">The charge having been investigated the Board finding merit, a complaint is filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1765.768" offset="7163522">When this case was brought at the San Francisco office of the EEOC had fewer investigators than there are members of this court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.807" offset="7191734">It had a 1,000 discrimination claims before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.072" offset="7204795">Nevertheless they got to this claim within six months, investigation was completed within a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.932" offset="7228201">But, then four months later conciliation was begun with the petitioners in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.499" offset="7254428">Conciliation went on for another six months and then it was ended and then at petitioner’s request conciliation was begun again for an additional five months.</text>

            <text syncTime="1812.249" offset="7349514">They sit down with the individual respondent and tend to work out an agreement, either for back pay possibly or for an end to the particular discriminatory practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.663" offset="7395176">The whole purpose of the 72 amendments and 64 Act really was to try to resolve as many as these claims through conciliation as possible so they do not end up in court.</text>

            <text syncTime="1854.303" offset="7517742">So as long as conciliation is worthwhile, the commission has to follow it out, the statute says it can only bring suit when conciliation has failed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1886.027" offset="7644593">5,000 claims last year were resolved through conciliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.445" offset="7662252">Now, there were over 40,000 discrimination claims resolved last year by EEOC and that is with 2,500 fulltime employees, 5,000 resolved through conciliation, the percentage of claims over three years old was reduced from 20% to 5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.311" offset="7745739">So my point I guess is that when you have the delay, it is a shared responsibility, it is not just the EEOC, it arises out of the nature of the work that conciliation process, the magnitude of the discrimination problem in this country and the limitations on the EEEOC resources.</text>

            <text syncTime="1929.422" offset="7818150">Well, now you do not see that with an ordinary Statute of Limitation, if the Statute of Limitation requires the owner to indict somebody and within four years or bring a civil action in four years, you do not say to the defendant has a shared responsibility, we both have to get this case to trial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1944.904" offset="7880113">No, but I do say that if the situation is such the Congress has required a conciliation, and conciliation is a two party business in other words respondents can, can encourage you to continue and say it is still worthwhile and coalition has to continue it, Congress must have setup a system that reflects this reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.233" offset="7957435">What I am saying is if you look at the scope of the problem and the resources available, you get some reflection of what Congress must have intended, sure Justice Rehnquist if there was clear Statute of Limitation, there would be no defense to say it is partly the respondent’s fault that we have not met it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.729" offset="8019398">But what we are suggesting is that there is no clear Statute of Interpretation in Statute of Limitations and one should not be implied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.775" offset="8047610">I like to turn to the merits of the case in particular to the language of section 706(f)(1) which reads, I think it is important what the language says, it says, if within 180 days from the filing of such charge the commission has not filed a civil action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.134" offset="8104975">The commission shall so notify the person aggrieved.</text>

            <text syncTime="2004.013" offset="8116573">May I stop you right there Mr. Martin and ask what the commission’s view is as, as to whether that imposes any time limitation within which the commission has a duty to notify the charging party.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas S. Martin</label>
            <text syncTime="2018.310" offset="8173729">The interpretation of that language from our point of view is that it imposes, it does two things, it sets out a time within which the commission can conciliate with the respondent without interference from private sue, private party can not sue before 180 days and then it sets its time after which the private party can demand and must receive from the commission a Right to Sue Letter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2050.271" offset="8301520">That is right the language does appear to do that, but the courts that have interpreted it, Courts of Appeal had unanimously come to the conclusion that it could not possibly meet that for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.777" offset="8351571">The 72 act was meant to setup a process were you would have to resolve these claims through conciliation if possible, that is throughout and if there has to be a suit it ought to be a commission suit rather than a private suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.562" offset="8406741">Now, if you interpret this as a mechanical limitation, then 180 days after you file the claim, before the commission has even probably gotten into this particular claim, the private party is going to have to sue or else his time will run and therefore he sues without either the thing being resolved through conciliation or without knowing that the commission might have brought suit, if he had waited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.270" offset="8505589">So, it twists around the whole statute and fundamentally upsets or frustrates the Congressional purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2110.032" offset="8540593">Well in other words as I understand your answer and this reflects to the earlier question by my brother Stevens, your position is first of all that there is no time limitation within which the notice to sue must be given and secondly that there is no duty upon the commission in the absence of a request to ever give a notice to sue, is that right?</text>

            <text syncTime="2198.272" offset="8893559">If it is a truly stale claim an injunctive remedy will not be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2203.242" offset="8913412">If it is a -- we talked about back pay which is under consideration here, in Albemarle this court said, prior to acquainting file, but in Albemarle this court said that if a cause of action was prosecuted in such a fashion as to cause prejudice to the opposing party, back pay could be denied altogether and in EEOC Versus General Electric which is at 532 F. 2d 359, the Fourth Circuit said that, in a situation where a commission suit has expanded the claims beyond what the charging party originally brought, back pay could be limited, not denied altogether but limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.277" offset="9081641">So there are equitable ways in terms of Title VII’s remedy to deal with this problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2664.492" offset="10758493">Usually it is 180, depends upon if there is a State FDP System.</text>
            <text syncTime="2669.559" offset="10778764">Secondly, the commission has to investigate and conciliate and go through all those steps and until it finishes that process, no cause of action accrues.</text>

            <text syncTime="2719.805" offset="10979698">There is two reasons why that is got to be wrong, first Congress views the delay problem is resulting from the scope of the commission’s task and not from EEOC foot dragging.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.279" offset="11017628">I refer the court to page 12 of the House Report 92238 where Congress’ view that delay arises from “The burgeoning workload accompanied by insufficient funds and a shortage of staff” and the Senate Report, 19415 at page 4, describes the EEOC’s effort as heroic at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.945" offset="11100279">Does that sound like Congress wants to put a 180 day limitation on it, just does not make sense, secondly, the language that they are relying upon, the notification provision could not have been response to the delay problem because that language was in the 64 act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3451.505" offset="13906457">On this point of claim of prejudice, the Assistant Solicitor General takes the position that there is no prejudice here to petitioner that we have never claimed prejudice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.150" offset="13973122">The nature of a statute of limitations defends of course that prejudice is assumed, need not to be proven, we did not raise the issue of laches in our motion for summary judgment for this simple reason, but latches is virtually impossible to prove by way of summary judgment because it is factually oriented and there will be substantial differences with respect to material fact, therefore latches has never been a part of this case at any time from the beginning but I think there is no obligation upon us to prove prejudice in order to prevail in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.120" offset="14160994">I think that Mr. Justice Marshall in a very real sense put his finger right on it, when he referred to the propensity of lawyers to put off until tomorrow.</text>

            <text syncTime="3558.295" offset="14333612">That is exactly what is happening here, the Solicitor General says that there are 90,000 new cases every year and we the EEOC, would not be able to do anything with them, so we will have that march them right in the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.760" offset="14399545">Well, they are assuming the negative, they are assuming they will not or can not do anything, but the fact of the matter is they can do something, they can investigate those charges, they can conciliate those charges, they can make judgments about which ones to take to court and they can make judgments about which ones maybe taken to court justice well by the individual private parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.720" offset="14495362">After all, the National Labor Relations Board with a influx of cases roughly half of that 90000 figure, about 45000 a year has a median time from charge to completion of investigation of 43 days.</text>

            <text syncTime="3619.678" offset="14579163">I think their staff is somewhat smaller than that of the EEOC, but I can not give any reliable figures, one reason Mr. Chief Justice, that they have a median time of 43 days is because they have a time limit internally imposed upon themselves of 45 days.</text>
