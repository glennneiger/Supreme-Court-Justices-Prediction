            <text syncTime="86.598" offset="446918">Garland Jeffers became involved in dealing in narcotics in Gary, Indiana in and around November 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.552" offset="498640">He and about four-five of his friends who were all around his age that is around 21 years of age met and began a pattern of drug-related activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.153" offset="557050">They engaged in robberies in which they stole drugs from other dope pushers on the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.616" offset="586934">They extorted money from other drug dealers for them to be able to continue an operation within the city of Gary and they themselves engaged in distribution of heroine and cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.193" offset="641269">Jeffers role in this drug operation which lasted from November 1971 through the time of the indictment on March 18, 1974 was admittedly one of at least a Supervisor; he began as Treasurer and after a certain period of time literally became the Head of the drug operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="190.787" offset="863623">What happened, Your Honor, was to focus to the court that all of the activities involved in the case presently before the court occurred in Gary, Indiana and part of them in Chicago.</text>

            <text syncTime="231.939" offset="1028194">It doesn’t to me Your Honor; it was nicknamed by the press as the Family and basically went by that name.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.126" offset="1073021">The reason to point out this background Your Honor is to emphasize that our issue today has to do with Jeffers’ multiple prosecution of separate drug violations under the Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.978" offset="1132371">The evidence presented at Jeffers’ first trial which was for a conspiracy to distribute heroin and cocaine is basically the same evidence presented in his second trial which is on the continuing criminal enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="273.319" offset="1193706">I point this out to the Court at the beginning so that there is no confusion that we are not talking about any type of multiple drug conspiracies, separate drug rings or any confusion concerning what evidence was presented in both the lower court cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.769" offset="1263610">The government has never contented nor could they in fact contend that the evidence used at the first trial and the evidence used at the second trial wasn’t from the same witnesses and wasn’t from the same series of transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.853" offset="1323901">Alright, a resume of the prosecutions were like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.272" offset="1341559">On March 18, 1974, Garland Jeffers and nine others were indicted in Hammon Criminal 74-56 with conspiracy to distribute heroin.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.809" offset="1395685">On the same date in a companion indictment, Jeffers by himself was indicted with a continuing criminal enterprise charge under 848.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.554" offset="1438735">Alright, upon request of the government the conspiracy case was set for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.997" offset="1472485">Objections were filed to the -- government then filed a motion for trial together of the conspiracy case and the continuing criminal enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.140" offset="1513027">Objections were filed by the attorney representing all of the defendants in the conspiracy case arguing that the presence of Jeffers in the court room on a continued criminal enterprise with prejudice that the other various defendants in the conspiracy and the Jeffers argued that the presence of the other nine defendants in the conspiracy would jeopardize his right to a free trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.982" offset="1600381">The Trial Court saw fit not to allow consolidation which left the record that Jeffers had pending against him a conspiracy charge and pending also in a separate indictment a continuing criminal enterprise charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.131" offset="1657014">The government then went to trial on the conspiracy charge and convicted Jeffers of conspiracy distribute heroin and he received a 15-year jail sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.242" offset="1781461">It was not a request for a severance.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.361" offset="1789925">The government had seen fit to return two indictments and then sought to try them together.</text>

            <text syncTime="441.781" offset="1867561">I think it would, as a matter of fact I think this situation is entirely different for one very obvious reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.020" offset="1892534">The government at any time had the option to sever Jeffers from the conspiracy trial and try him later on the conspiracy in the continuing criminal enterprise trial at one time.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.590" offset="1946869">That is the big distinction here.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.086" offset="1956795">These two indictments were not joined and the request was for the government to join the two of them together.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.006" offset="1984485">In other words, the first trial took place, the government still had an option before trying him on a conspiracy to sever him from the conspiracy and attempt to try him together later on the continuing criminal enterprise.</text>

            <text syncTime="483.699" offset="2035267">If they had done that, could the Jury have convicted him on both of those counts?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen C. Bower</label>
            <text syncTime="489.475" offset="2058359">Well, my response should be no, and is no.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.616" offset="2074973">I would suggest that we file Justice Powell’s Footnote 17 and 18 in Iannelli and instruct the jury as follows that they should not consider the conspiracy charge against Jeffers unless they find him not guilty of the continuing criminal enterprise and should only consider the conspiracy charge if they find him not guilty of the continuing criminal enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.120" offset="2172985">Alright, the Jeffers prior to the second trial in fact raised the double jeopardy claim by a motion for dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.930" offset="2204227">In that dismissal he alleged that the evidence to be used against him would be the same and asserted prior to the second trial that conspiracy was lesser included offense of the continuing criminal enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.466" offset="2250307">It appears to me to the court that the first big crucial step that must be taken by Jeffers in order to substantiate his violation of double jeopardy rights is whether or not conspiracy to distribute heroin is a lesser included offense in a continuing criminal enterprise charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.968" offset="2328361">Jeffers submit and argues to the Court that it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.436" offset="2354274">The standard definition of a conspiracy briefly stated, simply an agreement between two or more that by concerted action to accomplish a criminal purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.368" offset="2405997">It is Jeffers’ contention that the continuing criminal enterprise charge under Section 848 means that a person, or person has to undertake a series of violation of federal drug law and that they have to be undertaken in concert with five or more people with whom he occupies a position as Supervisor or Manager and for what he derives substantial income.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.448" offset="2510278">The crucial statutory definition, the Jeffers contends is controlling is that the continuing criminal enterprise statute requires that the series of drug violations to be taken in concert with five or more.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.533" offset="2566598">I submit to the Court that in concert can only mean that there has been an agreement in design and plan and that this is a basic definition of the conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="642.808" offset="2671714">The government has taken a possession that Iannelli controls this case and the fact that this honorable court found in Iannelli that the gambling offense was not phrased in terms of the conspiracy statute or that to gambling offense did not require an agreement, therefore they were separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.082" offset="2756769">The slight difference in phraseology as appears in a continuing criminal enterprise statute should not be controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.859" offset="2783936">I submit Your Honor that it is controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.231" offset="2797416">The reason why is that if the government’s possession is correct, this Court is going to have to find that the phrase in concert as appears in the continuing criminal enterprise statute must be interpreted to mean not in concert.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.047" offset="2860632">It is Jeffers’ possession that a conspiracy is an essential basic element of the continuing criminal enterprise, and as such if the continuing criminal enterprise charge is proven a conspiracy will in fact be proven.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.482" offset="2934402">Therefore, Jeffers’ contends that if he is tried and convicted on a lesser included offense of conspiracy, he may not be prosecuted subsequently on a greater offense of the continuing criminal enterprise.</text>

            <text syncTime="834.258" offset="3437520">Well, but Mr. Bower just so, you would agree that if the statute were read as an innocent dukes statute then there would be no lesser included offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.108" offset="3468867">Your point as I understand it is, that is manifestly unreasonable reading of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="845.934" offset="3484227">Yes to both questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.485" offset="3498438">The concept of in concert, perhaps best can be pointed out by an analogy, in that if you call the Boston Pops Orchestra together formed to play in concert they are all jointly acting, but you wouldn’t expect each individual musician to be playing a different song.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.408" offset="3594150">The “in concert” requires not only joined action but an agreement as to the in, agreement is the design or scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.453" offset="3626333">The argument that innocent dukes such as hired messenger boys to make delivery, they are not part of any conspiracy or drug ring at all, unless they are aware of what the goals are, they are aware that they are delivering heroin then they are part of the agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.540" offset="3694670">Then they are part of the continuing criminal enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.756" offset="3711492">So I think that even though the government contends that Jeffers could be convicted if there were five innocent dukes, I would say that this could not be under the meeting of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.618" offset="3750990">It requires five other individuals actively participating in the drug operation, and in fact Your Honor, that is exactly what was present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.553" offset="3798741">There were no innocent dukes.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.034" offset="3808668">The prosecutions against the variety of the family members, the drug ring members all show that they were aware and participated in.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen C. Bower</label>
            <text syncTime="977.961" offset="4012318">The conspiracy is the lesser included, the continuing criminal enterprise is the greater for several reasons, one, the continuing criminal enterprise has a great amount of additional elements that required to be proven beside the conspiracy, besides the in concert action with five or more, they got to show he was a Supervisor, they got to show he receives substantial income.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.456" offset="4090268">I would point out, two, that supports this is the fact that the continuing criminal enterprise statute carries by far the heavier penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.532" offset="4122660">On first offense it is ten years to life non-suspendible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1009.376" offset="4138020">On the conspiracy charge, if it is conspiracy to distribute it is up to the same as a substantive offense for 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.476" offset="4170412">So it seems evident that Congress in writing 848, continuing criminal enterprise statute in imposing such a heavy penalty, penalty intended to cover the evils that are present from conspiratorial behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.730" offset="4231434">So, not only do the penalties but the language of the statute strongly suggest that conspiracy is in fact included.</text>
            <text syncTime="1042.409" offset="4270095">I would direct the Court’s attention to Iannelli and suggest to the Court that this Court’s treatment in the Iannelli case warns Jeffers’ double jeopardy claim been sustained, and Iannelli, Justice Powell’s opinion in footnote 17 and 18 discuss concept of Blockburger and the concept of whether or not in the Iannelli case gambling offense, 1955 gambling offense required an agreement or conspiracy as part of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.031" offset="4412619">This Court specifically found in Iannelli that the gambling offense did not require conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.386" offset="4441981">Jeffers case is the other side of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.449" offset="4454310">In Jeffers a continuing criminal enterprise does in fact require conspiratorial activity, it requires action in concert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.032" offset="4492658">Therefore, applying Iannelli to Jeffers it is logical to come to the conclusion that Jeffers’ rights of double jeopardy have been violated by the multiple prosecution.</text>

            <text syncTime="1574.336" offset="6397821">The indictment charging petition with the conspiracy and the indictment charging him with the continuing criminal enterprise were returned on the same day by the same grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.029" offset="6432616">The government then moved to consolidate those two indictments for trial in one case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.873" offset="6451946">Petitioner however objected, he argued, I am reading from the Page 15 of the appendix, this is his objection to the government’s motion to consolidate, that consolidation of these indictments would be improper in this case for the reason is that neither the parties nor the charges are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.254" offset="6529478">He said at Page 18 of the appendix that the government was attempting to consolidate a conspiracy of ten defendants with a substantive offense of only one defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.771" offset="6571587">He said to add a substantive defense to the conspiracy charge would only confuse the jury, and he concluded on Page 23 of the appendix that consolidation would be wrong since there is neither an identity of defendants nor an identity of charges in the two indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.204" offset="6645252">His arguments of course prevailed, the District Court denied the government’s motion and ordered that the indictment to be tried separately as they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.060" offset="6680674">Prior to trial in the instant case the petitioner moved to dismiss the indictment completely reversing his position and now arguing that the government was at fault for not joining all the charges against him in one case, this is at Page 29 of the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1660.934" offset="6744204">Petitioner also argued that once the District Court had exceeded to his request that the indictments to be tried in two trials, then the government was obliged, petitioner said, by the double jeopardy clause to elect which indictment it would bring to trial against him and to forego prosecution on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.755" offset="6819541">That motion of course was not granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.647" offset="6839081">In his reply brief for the first time in this case, petitioner now takes he had a third position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.597" offset="6866875">He argues that his objection to the government’s motion to consolidate has been misinterpreted all this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.618" offset="6890908">He says at Page 5 of his reply brief that he was objecting not to trial of both charges together in a single trial but to the presence of the other conspiracy defendants in the same case with him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.894" offset="6944093">The suggestion in short is that the petitioner actually wanted all of the charges brought against him in a single case involving him alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.185" offset="6977216">The record slightly refutes this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.145" offset="6989024">It is true that in the objection, in his objection to the government’s motion to consolidate, the petitioner said that he feared that the evidence of a word X of his co-conspirators which would be admissible against him in the conspiracy case would carry over and prejudice him in the jury’s mind on the continuing criminal enterprise charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.480" offset="7074392">But the remedy said petitioner, was to try the charges separately, not to try him alone free of all the other defendants, indeed if the charges had been tried separately that very same evidence would have been admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.661" offset="7123084">The evidence of his co-conspirators of word X whether or not they were named as co-defendants in a case charging him with both conspiracy and a continuing criminal enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.968" offset="7168328">Furthermore the docket entries in the two cases show that petitioner never wanted both charges tried together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.828" offset="7199780">The indictments were returned on March 18, trial on the conspiracy charge was set first for May 20, trial on the continuing criminal enterprise charge was set for June 24.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.018" offset="7248576">In early April the government moved to consolidate, on April 29, petitioner filed his objections to that motion and the hearing was held on April 30, that hearing was inconclusive, it was continued over to May 7, and between that first half -- the first part of that hearing on May 30, and the second on May 7, the petitioner moved to postpone the continuing criminal enterprise from its initial date of June 24 over to August 12, that motion was granted, that was not we submit the action of one who wanted to go to trial on both charges in a single case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2657.414" offset="10730176">Thus for example, if the greater crime, has not yet actually been committed when the lesser is tried as in the Diaz case or for example if the defendant can conceal the full extend of his crime from the government so that the government does not know the greater offence has been committed when the lesser is tried or as in the present case, if the government is prohibited by order of court from trying both cases together, then we submit the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar prosecution for the greater offence, provided of course that there was a conviction on the lesser included offence and provided that any punishment that he has suffered from the lesser offence be credited.</text>

            <text syncTime="2973.196" offset="11993249">If he was tried in one trial on both the conspiracy and the continuing criminal enterprise, the evidence of his co-conspirators' overt acts would be admissible against him on the conspiracy charge, even if they were not named as co-defendants that requires an instruction by the District Court to the jury that they should not consider the evidence of overt acts on the continuing criminal enterprise charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2995.503" offset="12082483">Now, the petitioner argues that our position is foreclosed by this court’s decisions in Waller against Florida and Robinson against Neil.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.846" offset="12111845">Those cases in our view, do not hold the prosecution for greater offence is always barred by an earlier conviction on a lesser included offence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3011.157" offset="12145073">Indeed that issue was not raised or argued in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.482" offset="12158447">They involved the question whether a municipality and the state with dual sovereigns under the Double Jeopardy Clause and holding that they were not, the court cannot be said to have passed upon or resolve the questions presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3028.210" offset="12213305">If those questions had been presented and passed, if those questions had been resolved in Waller or in Robinson, then presumably the court could have decided Blackledge against Perry on double jeopardy grounds, and presumably the court or perhaps the court would not have granted a writ of certiorari and the case to be argued next Brown against Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.235" offset="12297419">I think that the issue was an open one, I think this is the first time it is presented to the court and I would repeat enclosing that the Due Process Clause is available to prevent the prosecutor from carving up crimes and bringing a series of prosecutions for no good reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.986" offset="12376413">The Double Jeopardy Clause however applies only when a defendant is twice put in jeopardy for the same offence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3148.875" offset="12695943">The pleading is in the file, is in the appendix, much of the argument in there is by the other remaining defendants and not wanting to be tried with Jeffers on the continued criminal enterprise trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3161.305" offset="12745680">Jeffers argument also, may it please to court on page 20 points out that he is talking about a steamroller effect upon the minds of the jury, the sheer aggregate of evidence have massed by the government and provided to the jury would create an inference of criminal disposition, based upon mere association with other defendants with whom the evidence is stronger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.603" offset="12834914">So what we have is a standard assertion that all of the defendants will not receive a fair trial by this prejudicial joiner or this trial together.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.406" offset="12878069">I submit to the court that United States versus Simmons holds that you cannot panelize the exercise of a constituently protected right by requiring an order to exercise that you must waive another right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.178" offset="12933239">The government would ask this court to rule that when Jeffers, including the other nine defendants in the conspiracy, when Jeffers sought to prevent the trial together, which is a Sixth Amendment right to have a fair trial, he of necessity had to waive Fifth Amendment rights and this goes back to Justice Steven’s comments or question to the government, is this a waiver of constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.870" offset="13035953">I submit that for the court to rule there is a waiver, there has been a waiver of double jeopardy rights of Fifth Amendment rights and that the record is simply absent in showing the type of knowing intelligent and voluntary waiver that is required of a basic fundamental constitutional right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3338.047" offset="13452658">Right, you have got a question of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3342.008" offset="13468541">In this instance, if I may go back to the waiver, we do not know why the trial court refused to grant the motion for trial together and I must point out that Jeffers did not object or did not take a stance that they could never be a trial together, what he claimed was that there will be prejudicial joinder if the ten defendant conspiracy was tied with the continued criminal enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.189" offset="13573239">Now when the trial court granted his objections, the government was in this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.813" offset="13595705">They had a pending conspiracy charge against him and a pending continued criminal enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.416" offset="13622141">The government then was the one that proceeded the trial on the conspiracy first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.539" offset="13642621">Jeffers did not cause demand or was responsible for the conspiracy trial being tried first.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.974" offset="13668430">The government had a very simple option.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.579" offset="13674803">They could have moved to (Inaudible) Jeffers from the conspiracy trial and tried him with the continued criminal enterprise later.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.516" offset="13698523">What I am submitting to the court is that Jeffers actions in seeking a fair trial free of prejudicial joinder in no way can be interpreted or should in no way be interpreted to mean that he had forever waive double jeopardy rights.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3413.908" offset="13756096">If the government had followed the option that you just suggested could it have properly requested a lesser included offence instruction in the trial?</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen C. Bower</label>
            <text syncTime="3424.680" offset="13799251">Most assuredly, and I would suggest that Justice Powell in Iannelli in Footnote 17 and 18 pointed out the proper procedure and I reiterated to the Court that that is the way they handle it, and that is a very practical, sensible way to handle it, because the penalty for continued criminal enterprise obviously covers the evil sought to be prohibited by a conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3452.867" offset="13911995">I would submit that at least Justice Burger has recognized that the same evidence rule is a matter of constitutional import.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.931" offset="13956194">I would suggest also to the court that if this court recognizes the same evidence rule, it must have necessity, follow along with a lesser included offence rule because by the definition set forth in Blockburger, applying it to the case at bar the conspiracy was proven, both in the conspiracy case in the continued criminal enterprise, the only additional elements in the continued criminal enterprise had to do with Jeffers position as manager and the fact he receives substantial income.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.856" offset="14083881">So I submit to the court that the first trial in conviction on the conspiracy as a lesser included offence or continued criminal enterprise should under the rules of double jeopardy, bar subsequent prosecution for the continued criminal enterprise.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3516.943" offset="14168204">Then why do you site Blockburger for the proposition that you just said?</text>

            <text syncTime="3521.271" offset="14185550">I site this because it has traditionally been viewed and used by lower courts for these purposes.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen C. Bower</label>
            <text syncTime="3532.223" offset="14229331">No, but I think if there is any doubt, I urge this court to adopt it, to make it clear that we have this constitutional protection, the double jeopardy and that the way we apply it is through the same evidence test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.259" offset="14309474">For years, cases have been coming before this court concerning with same evidence versus same transaction, and the courts repeatedly held that the same transaction rule is not what the Double Jeopardy Clause was meant to cover.</text>
            <text syncTime="3568.308" offset="14373736">If it is not the same evidence rule, I would submit we have no viable double jeopardy provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3578.557" offset="14414696">So I would urge the Court that the lesser included offence rule is simply an extension of the save (ph) evidence rule that that if not elevated to constitutional standards by this Court, should be elevated to such standard.</text>
