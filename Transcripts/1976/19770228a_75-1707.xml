            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100554">We will hear arguments first this morning in 75-1707, Ohio Bureau of Employment Services v. Hodory.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.101" offset="152903">Mr. Szilagyi, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="18.528" offset="174637">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.842" offset="187907">This case involves the constitutionality of Section 4141.29(D)(1)(a) of the Ohio revised code.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.791" offset="219672">This Section disqualifies individuals from receiving unemployment benefits, if there is an unemployment that was due to a labor dispute other than a lockout at any factory, establishment or other premises located in this or any other State that is wholly owned or operated by the employer in which the employee is or was last employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.575" offset="318833">This is commonly referred to in the unemployment field as the Functional Integrated Plant Theory whereas you have multiple plants, one employer, and all of the plants operate as a single unit that produces one-single product or end-products.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.610" offset="406918">Plaintiff-appellee represent approximately 1250 steel workers who became unemployed as a result of a strike at the wholly owned and operated coal mines of the steel companies which cut-off the supply of coal that the steel companies needed to continue production in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.508" offset="478494">Plaintiff’s denied benefits by the administrator because of disqualification in our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.795" offset="507646">There is an appeal pending before the Board of Review in the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services with appellees and their class and this was pending the outcome of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.297" offset="561667">During the pendency of appeal before the board, the appellees filed an action in the Federal District Court, Northern District, and Eastern Division in Cleveland as a class action under 42 U.S.C. 1983 for a declaratory judgment seeking as unconstitutionality of the statute and also for injunctive relief in the way of past benefits.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="141.786" offset="667620">Was the administrative proceeding pending at that time, the case was first brought in the District Court?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Szilagyi</label>
            <text syncTime="147.879" offset="691966">Yes Mr. Chief Justice, it was, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.757" offset="707535">Appellees alleged that the Ohio Statute was unconstitutional on its face and as applied because it violated the Supremacy Clause dealing conflict with 42 U.S.C. Sections 503(a)(1) and 303(a)(1) of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.308" offset="777752">Additionally, they alleged, that it was a violation of Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.522" offset="802621">Appellees did not name either US Steel or Republic Steel in the District Court as the party defendants as required under the Ohio statutes as an interested party, since their funds are drawn against because payments of unemployment benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.258" offset="889556">The defendants in the Court below argued that the case was not a proper case for a three-judge District Court and an action for injunction damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.144" offset="937099">During the oral argument, the appellees changed it from money damages and said that it was benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.171" offset="973148">Plaintiff-appellee has failed to exhaust their remedy at law.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.710" offset="987359">We argued that the plaintiff and his co-worker had a pending appeal before the Board of Review and the Court should not hear.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.442" offset="1014317">Plaintiff-appellee has failed to meet the requirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3).</text>
            <text syncTime="234.819" offset="1039813">The class was a definite class that plaintiffs would furnish names, no notice was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.349" offset="1061860">The unemployment compensation laws in Ohio are solely the State’s concern and have not been preempted by the Federal Government and we argue that US District Court should abstain from the hearing of the case, for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.177" offset="1109194">Comity and that they are already were in the state administrative process and could go up through the process to the State Courts, to the Federal Courts in the normally judicial manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.529" offset="1154647">The District Court convened a three-judge panel to determine the constitutionality of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.109" offset="1176903">The memorandum opinion, however, the three-judge court which was found in the jurisdiction statement arise on page 48 held that injunctive relief was proper under 28 U.S.C. 2283 in our injunction statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.863" offset="1239911">They said that abstention was not proper in the instant case since plaintiff had stated a good cause under 42 U.S.C. 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.786" offset="1271676">The Ohio Courts had previously ruled on the validity of the statutes, therefore, the frugal for the plaintiffs to go through the process again.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.963" offset="1304381">The Court found in the prerequisites to certification that the prerequisites of certification had been banned under 23(a) and (b), despite as I said no fact and notice was given.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.153" offset="1349103">And they said that the operative effect of 4141.29(D)(1) was disqualifies benefits to plaintiffs who violate the Equal Protection and Due Process Clause as guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment and 42 U.S.C. 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.494" offset="1418484">We generally argued at oral argument that granting benefits to workers laid off due to a strike in a parent company subsidiary plant would in effect be subsidizing the union members of the steel workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.555" offset="1474699">Granting of benefits would place the employer in an unfair disadvantage in negotiations with the unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.253" offset="1501553">That the financial burden of supporting the striking members is shifted from the Unions Treasury to the State of Ohio, it is conceivable that no concerted effort by the mine workers to negotiate a fair settlement would be pursued until the employer reached the financial crisis.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.113" offset="1568949">The difference between the mine workers of say a 100 and maybe 5,000 or 6,000 steel workers, you can see the impact upon the employer’s fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.406" offset="1606147">The State has a legitimate purpose in protecting the physical integrity of its compensation fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.432" offset="1630180">Strikes involving large Corporations such as US Steel, the auto workers, the Rubber Companies, and other corporate giants involved many hundreds and thousands of employees which would sometimes last many weeks further depleting our funds.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="396.791" offset="1687650">Mr. Szilagyi, is it clear that the statute in this case does prevent any unemployment benefits to be paid to the respondents?</text>

            <text syncTime="411.387" offset="1746059">Mr. Justice, the statute, when this case was brought up, did disqualify benefits if it was a wholly owned and operated subsidiary that went on strike which caused the main plant to strike.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.136" offset="1805096">In this instant case, there were about 2,000 employees involved in Reno, Ohio, Cleveland, Youngstown, Warren I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.837" offset="1847832">The Board of Review in half of the cases found that the employees in the Larine Plant, for instance, were qualified for benefits because under some tests that they had for as far as supplying fuel, they had a 50/50 test, but they said, “Unless the main plant was receiving or depending on the subsidiary for more than 50% of the coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.342" offset="1949919">It was not due to a strike or labor dispute, but it was caused because of lack of fuel, and therefore, a lack of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.741" offset="1983460">Therefore, the Cleveland and Reno people did get benefits, which is on appeal by the steel company of course.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="482.608" offset="2030898">So, it is not clear so far that it has not been finally determined by the State of Ohio and the Administrative appeal process that these people are deprived of their unemployment benefits, is that correct?</text>

            <text syncTime="527.666" offset="2211143">I do not think the administrative agency or the bureau is bound by the Supreme Court decisions and Court of Appeal decisions in Ohio which held the statute constitutional, and therefore, the issue of constitutionality would not get into it until they got to next level, Common Pleas Court, Court of Appeals, and possibly into the Federal Judicial.</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.623" offset="7463010">Good morning Mr. Justices, Mr. Szilagyi, Co-Counsels and all citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.234" offset="7489445">Briefly stated, we think this Ohio statute negates the whole purpose of the Federal Unemployment Compensation Act filed in 1936 at a time when I was just toddling around and most of you gentleman understand better and I now ask you to try to recall back what was it like back in the 30s and remember why that statute and US member of the jury can do that, you do not have to forget your common sense as we say to jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.526" offset="7618595">And, with all due deference and respect, this case Mr. Szilagyi is talking about and the State has talked about, administrative procedure, administrative expertise comes through in the presentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.694" offset="7683274">I would also point out to this Court that the members of the lower three-judge court, particularly the Honorable Judge Celebrezze.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.528" offset="7714621">I was an Assistant Attorney General for the State of Ohio, Bureau of Employment Services before his elevation to HEW where he became the Secretary of HEW in the Kennedy administration and he was in the position to be knowledgeable of these statutes to be administrating from the whole United States not just Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.177" offset="7801243">He was the man who decided this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.992" offset="7808453">We have judicial expertise here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.668" offset="7815140">Judge Thomas Lambros was a common Pleas Judge before he was elevated to the bench and decided many unemployment compensation cases and that appears in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.736" offset="7855473">And the Court knows this through its administration, those judges and those Courts these are matters that you can take judicial notice of it if you like.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.620" offset="7898941">Briefly, I would like to point out that there are few what we would call politely inaccuracies in the statements of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.807" offset="7935721">The State asserts that the Ohio statute as passed in 1936 is essentially the same as the Ohio Amendment which we are attacking in 1961 and it lived until 1975, a period of 14 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.380" offset="8018059">It is not essentially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.748" offset="8027463">Prior to 1961, had Mr. Hodory and his group applied, they would have received benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.652" offset="8059124">In 1963, there was only one other State in Ohio that excluded under this circumstances and that was North Carolina which passed this severe exclusion in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.537" offset="8114608">Up to that point, all of the States would allow benefits at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.195" offset="8157240">Furthermore, the State relies upon a case in support of a proposition of law that Michigan statutes or somewhat like Ohio statutes characterizes that as the law of Michigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.172" offset="8245220">Well, we point out as we do at Page 57 of the brief, Chrysler v. Smith 297 Michigan, Page 438 was expressly overruled in Park v. Appealed Board of Michigan, 355 Michigan 103, and that appeal appears in our brief and that case is not good law for anything.</text>
