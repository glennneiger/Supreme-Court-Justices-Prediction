            <text syncTime="74.566" offset="398738">New York offers grants and subsidized loans to undergraduate and graduate students among its Higher Education Assistance Programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.603" offset="430921">Only grants are directly in issue on this appeal, particularly region's college scholarships which are awarded competitively on the basis of performance on an examination and to Tuition Assistance Awards known as TAP which are available to any qualified student.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.546" offset="494660">The question presented is whether New York may, consistently with the Equal Protection Clause offer these grants to state residents who are citizens, to aliens willing to become citizens and to certain alien refugees.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.414" offset="546173">Necessarily excluding other aliens including aliens like appellees here in, who are permanent residents who had refused to become an American citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.077" offset="584730">The Mauclet case was instituted in the Western district of New York in February 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.566" offset="610748">The Rabinovitch action was instituted in the Eastern district of New York in August of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.955" offset="632273">Both cases were determined by a Three Judge District Court in the Eastern District which ended in a judgment from which this appeal is taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.529" offset="662575">Now appellee Mauclet is a French citizen and he has been a permanent resident alien in the United States since 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.205" offset="689324">He was a graduate student at the State University of New York at Buffalo at the time the judgment below was entered and he had been denied a Tuition Assistance Award as a graduate student, for the 1974-1975 academic year on the basis of the State Statute involved section 661 because in essence he refused to become an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.830" offset="771766">Appellee Rabinovitch is Canadian, he has been a permanent resident in New York and in the United States since 1964, he was an undergraduate student at Brooklyn College in the city of New York when the judgment was entered and he was not a Regions College scholarship for the same academic years involved in the Mauclet case because again he refused to apply for American citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.460" offset="854313">Indeed as he states in his affidavit filed below, he has no intention of applying for American citizenship.</text>

            <text syncTime="235.997" offset="1044485">We do not know what opening that program would mean and indeed a statistics that would be more potentially relevant namely an age category of permanent resident aliens in New York were not available from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the ones that were, were completely unrealistic.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.772" offset="1187531">We may not be speaking about very much however this, given the quality of this scholarship program as a selection program it does have an extension in terms of other scholarships which are necessarily equally selection programs and then they have involving much greater public cost.</text>

            <text syncTime="299.196" offset="1297246">Of course Your Honor, it's the basis of any selection program that involves a public benefit is of course, ultimately a finite resource and of course the question then becomes, who has the better demand on that resource, the people who are included or all people who are now excluded.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="314.346" offset="1357850">Now, the kind of grants you are talking about here are not ultimately repayable, I tell you, they are not loans.</text>

            <text syncTime="320.369" offset="1381987">That is exactly right Your Honor, the Region Scholarships and the TAP awards are pure grants-in-aids, they are gifts.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.812" offset="1411766">Now, a separate issue is in fact raised in this case with respect to student loans which by definition are repayable.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.457" offset="1438307">Now, the statute, the state statute, in issue Section 661 covers student loans and appellee Rabinovitch has attempted to place the regulation of that statute, these are the student loans in issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.766" offset="1499538">We contested his standing to do that below and the issue was determined against us, we have re-raised it on this appeal and it raises some very significant questions, however I think it's sufficient at this point to point out to you, that to the extent that loans are in fact subsidized by public money, they are to that extent gifts and can be fairly analogized to the grant program.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="371.329" offset="1585742">Well, except, I would think for you would have an argument available to you in the loan situation that you don't have in the grant situation, that someone who insists on remaining a national, a national of Portugal is much more apt to be avoid service of process, that New York tries to compel repayment of a loan, 20 years from now, than someone who is a resident of the United States.</text>

            <label>Ms. Judith A. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="395.738" offset="1683440">That's exactly right Your Honor and it's our position on this appeal even putting aside the standing question, that remand would need to be had on the loan issue to raise indeed the issue just mentioned namely whether there was a basis to infer that there was this additional rationale that the alien unwilling to become a citizen would be more likely to leave the jurisdiction and not return than the alien who is willing to become a citizen, we do seek remand or we believe that unless 661 can be sustained under the Equal Protection Clause but to invalidate the statute would be quite because we would want to raise that additional issue including some other additional issues that pertain specifically to loans because they are partially federally subsidized.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.845" offset="1863894">The grants-in-aid, the TAP awards and the Regions College Scholarships are not in fact in any way federally subsidized, they are completely state?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="449.854" offset="1899838">Miss Gordon, I am not sure, it would make at least for me, make any difference whether it was a $100,000 a year or $10 million a year but if the District Court is correct, is it unreasonable to speculate that this might bring an influx of graduate students from countries all over the world who would be pass to our door.</text>

          <turn speaker="judith_a_gordon" startTime="471.411" stopTime="500.044">
            <label>Ms. Judith A. Gordon</label>
            <text syncTime="471.411" offset="1986147">Absolutely, that's exactly the problem or the question you pose, is exactly the problem that arises when any program that was formally closed is now open and we tend to calculate what would happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.733" offset="2039437">Now, obviously, if any alien knew that by his mere presence in the state, either as an immigrant or possibly as a non-immigrant, he could get aid to education, well, presumably he would want to come here.</text>

            <text syncTime="2373.407" offset="9594049">We think it can hardly be classified as a gift, when what the New York State Legislature is doing, is taking the tax dollars which aliens of course, contribute equally with citizens and determining to dispense them in a particular program.</text>

            <text syncTime="2402.246" offset="9709406">Let me read to you, that judgment is articulated in 1961 when the program was really a put in to high gear and the Tuition Assistance Awards first came into being.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.972" offset="9760397">The New York State Legislature said, 'Higher education is no longer a luxury, it is the necessity for strength, fulfillment and survival.'</text>

            <text syncTime="2781.849" offset="11227851">Oh, No, absolutely they are clearly classifications of discriminations and the what Mathews holds is the Federal government has the power and reading Hampton together with Mathews, at least the President and the Congress have the power to make such discriminations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2798.532" offset="11294620">What Mathews, I think quite clearly holds in the Fourth part of the opinion, is that the State governments do not have the similar power, unless and I have heard very little today about the unless part, unless the discrimination satisfies some legitimate and substantial State interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.648" offset="11379048">We look to see what the State interest is, in this particular statutory classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.971" offset="11412380">Frankly, the argument put forth by the Stat, we think is nothing but a convenient but false post-talk rationalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.076" offset="11452818">The State tells us that they are seeking to encourage in essence, voter registration and office holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.990" offset="11480403">Now, how does the Statue which simply provides tuition assistance, region scholarship or student loans encourage voter registration or office holding?</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.915" offset="11524184">Indeed, when confronted with this particular statutory purpose, the District court said not only can the State satisfy a substantial interest here, there isn't even a rational relationship between this asserted purpose and the Statute under consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.545" offset="11602656">We search a link to seek a method by which this Statue will some how further these goals and indeed it is interesting to know as the brief for Mauclet points out in detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.950" offset="11656260">New York has a variety, a whole host of these, habitual reflexive discriminations against the aliens and they are in court on many of these cases right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.525" offset="11702548">In every one of these cases, the same rationalization is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.462" offset="11718326">We are told that requiring citizenship for the licensing of physicians promotes the New York political community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.690" offset="11755211">The State argued, believe it or not that the same political community rationale justified their requirement that physical therapist be citizens of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.391" offset="11798052">It is a ubiquitous argument trodded out on every occasion by the New York Attorney General presumably seeking to find support in the Sugarman caveat as what would be a substantial State interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.181" offset="11857193">In this particular case, we don't see the how the Statute even approaches anything which we could be consider to be a substantial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.491" offset="11894392">We don't see how the Statute is narrowly and precisely drawn to promote the interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2955.695" offset="11923231">Indeed, we think it's clear and we think Legislative Memorandum Number 8 focusing on the $10,000 saving.</text>
            <text syncTime="2962.968" offset="11952384">We think it's clear that what New York was doing was out of habit, focusing on a traditionally discriminated class and seeking to save a few dollars of their expense and doing it in a situation where the New York Legislature has already determined the significance and the importance of this program to the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.319" offset="12041722">Now, the fact that total foreclosure is not the consequence of this program, should make we think, no difference.</text>

            <text syncTime="3109.693" offset="12539198">We think because we have a single Statutory prescription, that is to say 661 (3) covers all three programs, because he has been injured in connection with two of the programs, because the State has admitted and admitted in the argument below and it's reflected in the opinion that if he applies for a loan, he will automatically be denied assistance.</text>

            <text syncTime="3157.258" offset="12729474">So, we see that there is no -- the remand in this case can serve no purpose, and indeed the State has never asked for it, and never sought to introduce any evidence or deal with the loan program in anyway differently until this moment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3212.671" offset="12951202">Second of all, there is a Statutory provision, 42 U. S.C 1981, which this Court has relied upon in Takahashi and Graham, which indicates that resident aliens have a right to enter and abide within all of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.921" offset="13012119">And in equality, legal privilege and right, and that when New York enacts its program, it is clearly interfering with the general plan and program articulated by the Federal government in the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="3282.947" offset="13232279">Yes Your Honor, I have a few minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3286.478" offset="13246385">The future progress of the State and Nation and the general welfare of the people depend upon the individual development of the maximum number of citizen leaders to provide a broad range of leadership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.562" offset="13294764">It is in the vital interest of the people of the State to develop fully this reservoir of talent and future leadership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.938" offset="13324230">That is a quotation from the same Legislative history that Mr. Greenberg quoted a few moments ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.882" offset="13347949">It appears in part of pages 12 and 13 of our brief, and it appears in the main volume of the McKinney in the pertinence of education law Sections, where it is a set forth in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.620" offset="13394970">So much for Post Hoc Rationalisation and indeed however, if the State were to infer any purpose from the face of a given Statute, absent any prior Legislative history, there would be absolutely nothing wrong with that inference under a strict scrutiny standard or under a reasonable relation standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3343.508" offset="13474486">Now, the citizenship and national affinity requirements with respect to real programs in issue have a 57 year history in the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.680" offset="13515237">They were started in 1920, when the regions with respect to region scholarships.</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.886" offset="13536031">They were expanded gradually throughout the years until they re-substantially -- their present form in 1962 and indeed as you can you see the programs themselves were expanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.984" offset="13576364">A loans coming shortly after Region Scholarships in 1957 and Scholar Incentive Awards coming shortly after that in 1961.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.377" offset="13617951">Now, appellees refer you, both appellees refer you to a figure $10,000 in 50 students.</text>
            <text syncTime="3386.619" offset="13646999">They come to that figure by starting their legislative research in 1961 with the birth of the Scholar Incentives Program, putting aside the 40 years of customary history that attached to the Region Scholarship Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.935" offset="13700184">Now, appellees' say and there is a difficulty here but it is easily resolved at the birth of the Scholar Incentive Program that bill was in the same package of bills, that occasionally revisions to the Region Scholarship Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.809" offset="13763714">One of the revisions of the Region Scholarship Program was a reference to the Board of the Region to establish an appropriate rule regarding citizenship and affinity for Region Scholarship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.382" offset="13801957">Accordingly, the Scholar Incentive Program, as I indicated, enacted at exactly the same time, didn't have a rule but the Legislative History that I just read you, was enacted with respect to that program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.638" offset="13851068">Appellants have submitted it was the purpose of the Legislature at that point to have the regions make a rule for both programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.878" offset="13880011">Appellee Mauclet comes in and he says, no, impossible, the Board of Regions didn't have the power, it only had the power to make rules with respect to Region Scholarships not with respect to Scholar Incentive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.043" offset="13924628">The answer to that question is quite simple, the power is found in Section 603 of the Education Law, as it appears in the main volume of the McKinney which was in fact aided to include border regions power over scholarship incentives, in 1961 when that program was created.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.809" offset="13991711">Now, the $10,000, as it turned out, over the period of time when scholar incentives were first enforced and this reference to the Board of Regions was enforced, the Board of Regions, in fact made a rule for Region Scholarships, it did not in fact make a rule for scholar incentives.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.355" offset="14053882">As a result, in 1969 the Legislature in essence adopted the Board of Regions rules for scholarships and codified them in the Statutes for both program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.266" offset="14093588">Now, in that re-enactment, in effect of this rule, there are two legislative documents that the appellees' refer to, first is report A) which started at the beginning apparently the beginning of 1969 Legislative session, it's says in effect, we want to put the Citizenship requirement back and there is an indication in that bill that the savings will be $10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.671" offset="14187107">That results to an indication in that bill that other items would have certain savings and there is an indication in every New York State Bill about the what fiscal ramifications of the given piece of Legislation are.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.557" offset="14230679">Notably, the very next report and indeed the one before, the Legislature apparently, Active Report 9, deletes the reference to $10,000 in 50 students, why does it do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3543.071" offset="14272788">I think because it was obviously gross error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3545.518" offset="14282506">The question of where this $10,000 figure came from is never explained and the question of the where 50 students came from is never explained, and indeed there is as appellees' themselves indicate in this immediately following report, the reference was itself deleted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.013" offset="14352514">Accordingly, I don't think that we can infer anything from that, what we can infer is that this particular -- that Section 661 in its present form is a matter of customary history in the State of New York over a very substantial period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3579.542" offset="14418656">Now, I would just like to take a few moments with respect to point raised by Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.600" offset="14438823">It is true that Section 661(3) now regulates three programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.620" offset="14458989">It is equally true that these three programs are separate and they are found in different portions of the Statute and they have different types of criteria incited to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.426" offset="14494202">The one appellant's position with respect to Rabinovitch is standing or is not a merely formality that he didn't obtain a final adjudication or final administrative determination of his rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3610.105" offset="14540909">Although, I certainly think that would be sufficient in itself, the point is, he never alleged a present need for the loan and there is absolutely no evidence in the record that he would have a deficiency between his anticipated expenses and his income would warrant a loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.383" offset="14602036">He says in his brief in response here, that, well, he wouldn't ask for an interest free loan which is one of the subsidies provided by the program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.163" offset="14637144">Of course, the additional subsidy provided by the program.</text>
