            <text syncTime="43.754" offset="278340">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.118" offset="291819">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the District of Columbia, Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.191" offset="308120">That Court affirmed the judgment of the Superior Court suppressing for use in evidence in respondent's prosecution for grand larceny and for receipt of stolen property, the testimony that respondent had given earlier before grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.299" offset="380531">Unlike the one just heard, this case does not involve the prosecution for perjury and accordingly it poses squarely the question of whether the constitution requires the Government to warn grand jury witnesses of their privilege against self-incrimination when the Government has reason to believe that the witness maybe indicted on the basis of the testimony that is sought.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.352" offset="484812">I will state some of the facts quickly since there is a claim that the Government’s conduct in this case violated the Due Process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.347" offset="520756">On the night of December 3, 1972, an officer of the metropolitan police stop the van type automobile after watching it make a u-turn and in the back of the van found a motorcycle that had recently been reported stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.907" offset="574986">The two occupants of the van were arrested and the police determined that the van belonged to the respondent and they notified him that the van was in their possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.521" offset="613439">Within the next several days in an effort to retrieve the van, the respondent went both to the police station and to the United States attorney’s office.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.530" offset="653458">On both occasions he said that he did not wish to press charges against the two men found in the van who would -- it had been thought might have stolen the van in addition to the Motorcycle.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.619" offset="689821">He said they were his friends and it had his permission to use the van.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.927" offset="707062">He also said that he himself had been driving the van on the evening in question and he explained the presence of -- earlier on the evening in question he had been driving the van and he explained the presence of the motorcycle in the van in a manner that both the police man to whom he spoke and the assistant United States attorney to whom he spoke found unpersuasive.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.205" offset="788146">I will get his explanation in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.451" offset="801207">The policeman in fact told the respondent that he did not believe his story and that if respondent were to testify to it in Court, they would be likely to get him into trouble.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.982" offset="839346">The Assistant United States Attorney gave the respondent back his van and gave the respondent also a subpoena to appear before the grand jury investigating the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.463" offset="877275">He did so because he was afraid respondent would not appear voluntarily either because the respondent would not want to testify against his friends or because he was himself involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.153" offset="923982">When the respondent came before the grand jury the Assistant United States Attorney in charge not the same one who had given him the subpoena was uncertain whether or not to seek an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.097" offset="963793">He was not sure what respondent's testimony would be or whether it would be believable and accordingly he decided to leave the matter entirely to the grand jury itself after they had heard his testimony -- after they had heard the testimony of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.989" offset="1023352">Before the respondent testified he was given full Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.643" offset="1037981">He said that he understood them that he wanted to answer questions regarding this after the motorcycle and that he did not want the services of a lawyer.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="240.932" offset="1067133">He had not gotten any Miranda warnings he was talking to the Assistant U.S. Attorney?</text>

            <label>Mr. William F. Sheehan, III</label>
            <text syncTime="245.473" offset="1085315">He had not had Miranda warnings when he was talking to the assistant.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.661" offset="1102033">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.726" offset="1118229">He then gave testimony to the following effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.928" offset="1131081">On the night in question he said he had been driving the van and he had stopped to help a stranger whose motorcycle had broken down.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.606" offset="1161801">The two of them put the motorcycle in the van, he said and drove on looking for help and the van itself drove down. Excuse me when the van itself broke down.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.540" offset="1201507">He then left the stranger with the motorcycle and van he said and walked a block or two away to a gasoline station where he telephoned his two friends to come help him.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.074" offset="1239646">He said that he waited at the gas station for two hours and his friends did not appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.312" offset="1256573">He said he then went back a block or two away to where the van had been left and found it was gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.485" offset="1281337">He said that he did not report the disappearance of the van because he said he assumed that his friends had come and fixed it and then driven it away.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.587" offset="1313729">The stranger who owned the motorcycle he said was never heard or seen again.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.709" offset="1334209">Never heard from or seen again.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.504" offset="1345390">Following his testimony in due course the grand jury indicted him along with the other two men for grand larceny and received stolen property.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.424" offset="1389066">The Superior Court then granted the respondent's motion to suppress his testimony on the ground that it had been obtained in violation of his privilege against self incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.263" offset="1424384">The Court held the Assistant United States Attorney conducting the grand jury had not adequately inquired into the respondents ability to understand his rights and in addition had failed to warn respondent on top of the warnings he had received that his testimony could result in an indictment by the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.741" offset="1498363">In affirming, the Court of Appeals said that the principal respect in which the full Miranda warnings which respondent had received were deficient was that he had not -- was in that he had not been told that he was a potential defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.521" offset="1561475">The upshot of the decision is that a potential defendant is entitled in the Court's view in the Court of Appeals view under the self-incrimination clause both the Miranda type warnings and to target warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.747" offset="1610376">It seems appropriate to begin the analysis here with something that in our view the Court of Appeals gave too little attention to.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.340" offset="1636707">The words of the constitutional provision themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.942" offset="1655097">No person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.986" offset="1679339">This Court in Miranda against Arizona found that the procedures surrounding custody interrogation by the police of a witness of a suspect were inherently coercive.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.222" offset="1716224">And accordingly it held, that a set of warnings was necessary in order to balance things out.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.556" offset="1741615">Without those warnings it is now conclusively presumed that any testimony statements given by the witness were compelled against the suspects will.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.412" offset="1784978">The issue for decision today is whether questioning it in front of a grand jury is also inherently coercive that warnings are required before any testimony given by a witness in response to questions by the Government maybe considered voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.326" offset="1848717">Our position is that there are many differences between the questioning of a suspect by the police in custody and the questioning of a witness in regular grand jury proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.067" offset="1887692">For the most part, we think that these differences are self evident.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.623" offset="1901902">They are also -- they are in any event set out at length in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.375" offset="1920920">I will mention only two.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.671" offset="1934085">Before the decision in Miranda the interrogation by the police occurred principally in private.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.292" offset="1956551">In contrast, the questioning of a witness before the grand jury occurs before between 16 and 23 private citizens who are not likely to be in our view so compliant to the prosecutor's wishes as to countenance the kind of abuses that were cataloged by this Court in Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.256" offset="2036381">Second question, I might add that the view that I just expressed was I think stated also by Mr. Justice Black in the Groban decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.472" offset="2085282">He said it would be very difficult for officers of the state seriously to abuse or deceive a witness in the presence of the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.780" offset="2114539">Moreover, the questioning in front of a grand jury is undertaken under the overall supervision of a District Court judge and frequently the questioning is transcribed and reported as it was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.761" offset="2166366">In short, the privacy that before Miranda allowed the abuses of custody interrogation that were perceived to exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.684" offset="2194056">It does not exist in the grand jury setting and there is according --</text>

            <text syncTime="1000.086" offset="4103711">The first was that it was public because it was in front of between 16 to 23 citizens and the second was it did have the protection of being under the overall supervision of the District Court and also there was the added safeguarded transcripts being made at the testimony in many cases as it was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1019.505" offset="4181347">To this point I’ve been talking only of the questioning of grand jury witnesses in general.</text>

            <text syncTime="1139.433" offset="4661060">Well, we think that as the Court recognized last term in the Beckwith case, the Miranda presumption of involuntariness and the Miranda type safeguards should apply only when it can be said that the setting of the questioning is indeed inherently coercive and that in our view has nothing to do with whether the Government thinks or knows this or that at the time of the questioning.</text>

            <text syncTime="1707.791" offset="6934549">The result is the same in respect of target warnings under the Due Process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.790" offset="6958582">We think that as I suggested in the argument just passed that there is little to be gained by shifting the analysis from the self-incrimination clause to the Due Process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.555" offset="6993586">A target warning seems to us to be conceivably helpful to the witness only insofar as it aids in the decision making process as to whether or not to invoke the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.129" offset="7027858">That process it seems to us is afforded all the protection to which it is entitled by the self-incrimination clause alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.702" offset="7062131">It must be assumed therefore that some values not associated with the privilege, not protected by the privilege are protected by the Due Process clause in the context of a case such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.041" offset="7107584">We can think of none.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.957" offset="7115212">In most cases, the witness already knows in addition whether or not he is a potential defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.654" offset="7134020">Indeed, he may know that far sooner than the Government will discover.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.023" offset="7155440">That would make an additional putative defendant warning doubly unnecessary as a matter of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.328" offset="7180727">In any event, the facts of this case certainly do not show a Due Process violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.210" offset="7200162">Before questioning the respondent in this case the grand jury -- in front of the grand jury, the attorney gave him full Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.444" offset="7237151">The respondent knew what crime was under investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.081" offset="7247705">The respondent knew in addition that his connection with the crime was known to the authorities by virtue of his own statements made earlier to the police and the Assistant United States Attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.310" offset="7280619">He also knew that the explanation of his involvement was not then believed by the policeman to whom he first told it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1800.219" offset="7304234">In these circumstances the prosecutor's failure to give him a target warning on top of full Miranda warnings, seems to us was not so fundamentally unfair as to deprive the respondent of Due Process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.154" offset="7351986">Indeed, we believe it was not unfair at all and I will reserve what ever time I have left Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1826.963" offset="7411231">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court I’m Frederick Weisberg, I’m counsel for Gregory V. Washington, the respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.615" offset="7445817">I’d like to begin by setting out what respondent's position is in this case and then the course of that state is clearly as I can what our position is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.204" offset="7480195">And then I would like to discuss briefly what I understand to be the position of the Government and why we think that position is simply unsupportable under this Court’s prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.218" offset="7524289">Our position in this case is simply put that the Government may not compel an individual to incriminate himself by requiring him to testify under subpoena before grand jury that has focused on him as a target for indictment and then after he testifies and he is indicted, use against him at his criminal trial, the compelled self incriminatory testimony without demonstrating that the defendant made a voluntary knowing and intelligent waiver when he chose to testify before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.512" offset="7649468">The factual premises of that position in this case are the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.900" offset="7662947">Both prosecutors testified below in this case in effect that their purpose in subpoenaing Mr. Washington to the grand jury was to enable the grand jury to determine after hearing his testimony whether or not he should be indicted for the offense under investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.571" offset="7729612">What they gave him was a very official looking piece of paper that commanded him to appear before the grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.188" offset="7752077">It was signed by the clerk of the Court in the name of the Chief Judge of the Superior Court commanding him to appear before the grand jury and answer questions in connection with an investigation into a crime of which he was suspect of having committed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.603" offset="7893765">He had it in the subpoena and it’s pre-signed by the clerk Court in the name of the Chief Judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="2023.768" offset="8198457">Having stated what our position is that I want to be quick to stay what our position is now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.380" offset="8220923">The issue in this case as we see it is not whether grand jury target witnesses are entitled to Miranda warnings or as the Government would prefer to put it are entitled to certain warnings on top of Miranda warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.789" offset="8274526">We are not asking this Court to extend the prophylactic rules of the Miranda case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.880" offset="8290931">We are not asking this Court in the case of grand jury target witnesses to manufacture a set of warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.377" offset="8312874">The failure to give any one of which automatically will result in the suppression of testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.678" offset="8334085">What we are asking this Court to recognize as it’s recognized in our view throughout the history of the Fifth Amendment privilege is that when the privilege applies as I will go on to indicate why we think it does apply in this case, it must be waived and the waiver must satisfy the requirements of a voluntary, knowing and intelligent waiver and that does not exist in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.339" offset="8416737">And I might add in that connection that what the Court below held, What Judge Nevenka writing for the Court of Appeals held was not Mr. Washington’s testimony must be suppressed because the Government failed to give a particular warning that he thought was required by some sort of prophylactic rule, extension of the Miranda rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.507" offset="8477445">What the Court of Appeals -- as they stated the issue at the outset of our opinion and as they held, Mr. Washington did not voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently waive his privilege for among other reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.545" offset="8525511">The fact that he had no way of knowing presumably or was certainly not told that he himself was the target of the investigation when he testified before the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="2703.633" offset="10917909">It seems to me, starting with the one that seems least like this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.185" offset="10936090">The difference between Gardner situation and Mr. Sullivan Situation and the situation of Marquette and Grosso is that the Government when it asks, when it compels Marquette and Grosso to file a tax return required only of gamblers knows that when it gets that return it has incriminating evidence of gambling which can then turn over to the States or the Federal Government for prosecution for gambling offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.671" offset="11030026">Like the defendants in Marquette and Grosso, Mr. Washington was subpoenaed because the Government knew what his story was likely to be and that it would like be likely to make him a criminal defendant if he told it to the grand jury and they just believed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.876" offset="11074853">Like the situation in Miranda, although we don’t rely in the prophylactic aspects in Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2750.601" offset="11105782">Aside from the custody aspect of Miranda which I hope to get to in a minute, because I get is absolutely nothing to do with this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.007" offset="11131382">The other half of the Miranda decision is the focus rationale that when the police are questioning suspect, non suspects in the fact finding process, people on the street who might know something about an offense, about whom they have no reason to think are guilty of any offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2771.714" offset="11190209">There’s no requirement to give warnings, there’s no requirement to get a waiver and if those persons happen to incriminate themselves at some point, there would be a burden to get warnings when he became a suspect but at least the threshold statements would not be excluded under the Miranda rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.921" offset="11243081">So to hear, if Mr. Washington was subpoenaed solely because he was someone who had seen the van driver away with the motorcycle, just an ordinary witness and lo and behold, when he got in there, the Government realize for the first time that this person maybe implicated in the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.009" offset="11307447">We think any incriminating statements made much like the ordinary witness at trial would not be protected by our analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2808.270" offset="11336495">Except that it is our view that when the person began to incriminate himself in the grand jury testifying under compulsion of subpoena, the proceedings ought to stop and the prosecutor ought to then say, “you are getting yourself into trouble perhaps you ought to consult with a lawyer.”</text>

            <text syncTime="3675.150" offset="14803989">I would like to add one point in the conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3678.910" offset="14819035">We think the issue in this case is whether the statements were voluntary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.376" offset="14832828">Voluntary statements are admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.797" offset="14842546">It was not -- this testimony was not compelled against the privilege against self-incrimination by the issuance of the subpoena alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.740" offset="14874311">That seems to me be the first question the Court has to decide, is whether the subpoena to appear coerces testimony in violation of the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.026" offset="14903463">If that does not as we believe it does not then the Court must decide whether or not this situation is one in which you can abandon the traditional test for voluntariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.765" offset="14950484">Was the witness's will overborne by some sort of informal coercive practices such as took place in the Miranda case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3721.712" offset="14990190">You know the over warning part of the warnings were given.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.566" offset="15001684">You need not answer any questions at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.016" offset="15011401">I take it that Government does not as a matter of routine give all witnesses such advise does it? Because that would mean nobody ever have to answer any questions for the grand jury?</text>
