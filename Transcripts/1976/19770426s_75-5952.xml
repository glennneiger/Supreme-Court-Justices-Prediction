            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100634">The next case, Trimble against Gordon, 75-5952, at issue in this case is the validity of a provision of the Illinois Probate Act, which allows illegitimate children to inherit by intestate succession from their mothers but not from their fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.832" offset="211916">Legitimate children, however, may inherit from both their mothers and fathers.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.534" offset="234694">This suite was instituted by a mother on behalf of her illegitimate child.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.919" offset="256219">The father had supported the child, openly acknowledged her and also, have been found to her father in a paternity order issued by an Illinois Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.885" offset="304076">He had not had a marital mother or legally adapted a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="55.654" offset="323197">He died without a will and this suite challenged the validity on equal protection grounds of the statute that prevented the child from inheriting.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.891" offset="364157">The Illinois Supreme Court sustained the validity of the statute, relying primarily on the decision of this Court in Labine against Vincent.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.459" offset="406371">A reason stated in an opinion filed today with the clerk, we reverse the judgment of the Illinois Supreme Court, although, we recognize the relevance of Labine, we think its rationale has been substantially undercut by more recent cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.912" offset="472200">The Chief Justice and Mr. Justice Stewart, Mr. Justice Blackmun, and Mr. Justice Rehnquist, have filed dissenting statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.742" offset="503547">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
