            <text syncTime="92.108" offset="471855">That order enjoins on constitutional and statutory grounds, parallel state and federal regulations, that have bearing upon the amount of benefits appellees may receive under the Food Stamp Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="126.181" offset="608110">Congress provided explicitly that the income of the household was to be the eligibility criterion for participation in the food stamp program, as well as the standard for determining what amount the household is required to pay for an allotment of food stamps.</text>

            <text syncTime="147.262" offset="692433">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.877" offset="698911">Congress, however, left to the Secretary the task of defining income.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.711" offset="714167">Income is not defined in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.820" offset="722631">The Secretary has to find income in regulations that are set out in the appendix to our opening brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.533" offset="745514">This case principally concerns the reasonableness of one of those regulations, as well as the regulation of the State of Iowa that is similar since the states are required to conform their administration of the food stamp program in conformity with the Secretary standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.382" offset="804864">Now, let me describe the Secretary’s regulations briefly and explain how they where applied to the appellee class in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.704" offset="830151">In general, the Secretary has provided that all money’s received shall be included in income.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.304" offset="852616">There are few exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.403" offset="857004">For example, for items of income that are none recurring or extraordinary, but otherwise, all moneys received are generally included to income.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.795" offset="890546">Now, included within the Secretary’s definition explicitly are payments received from federal assistance programs that where not specifically exempted by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.756" offset="930356">Appellees in this case are individuals who receive such assistance in the form of an allowance that the State of Iowa provides to welfare recipients that are attending a work and training program.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.294" offset="980511">That state program is federally funded under Title 20 of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.036" offset="1003499">Now, the regulation under which, the appellees receive this allowance provides for a sick monthly $60.00 flat allowance for full time trainees and it was $44.00 to the time this lawsuit was instituted.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.324" offset="1056684">Part time trainees receive a somewhat different type of grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.030" offset="1071522">They are provided a travel allowance for actual expenses computed on a rate per mile basis up to a maximum allowable amount to $45.00 a month.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.773" offset="1110497">These allowances like all other forms of government assistance, not specifically exempted by Congress were included in the Secretary’s regulatory definition of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.634" offset="1149889">The Secretary’s regulations also allowed the certain expenses are allowable as deductions from income.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.956" offset="1175176">In part pertinent here, the Secretary allows an itemized deduction for tuition and other mandatory educational fees and a standardized monthly 10% deduction of all travel allowances or $30.00 whichever is less to cover incidental expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.677" offset="1238079">But the Secretary expressly has disallowed an itemized deduction for the commutation or other incidental expenses incurred by one who is attending school or attending the training program.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.748" offset="1282382">Now, I hasten to point out that the Secretary has not singled out students or trainees or special treatment in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.717" offset="1310281">No individual, be a student, a worker or whatever is allowed an itemized deduction for transportation costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.238" offset="1344345">Indeed, if you’ll take a glance at the regulations, I think you will conclude that ordinary household expenses such as transportation cost generally are not deductible under the Secretary’s regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="512.724" offset="2154245">The appellees in this case received -- all received the training allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.746" offset="2170337">I think the question then is or initially is regardless of how its spent is that reasonably included within the income of these recipients.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.417" offset="2205027">Then, we must confront the fact or the reasonable assumption since the record is not clear that the appellees spent some or all of their -- of this allowance on transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.927" offset="2247032">And then the question is whether the Secretary is required by the Act or the constitution to permit an itemized deduction for such transportation costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.601" offset="2285798">I think the issue in this case really focuses upon the second of those two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.892" offset="2306905">As I mentioned in our reply -- as we mentioned in our reply brief, I think there is now little or no dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.718" offset="2334281">I maybe wrong that the Secretary’s inclusion of this allowance was reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.674" offset="2354030">As I pointed out, the inclusion of the allowance, separate and apart from how it is spent, accords with the common understanding of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.824" offset="2382660">It is income in every sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.081" offset="2391646">Those who receive the allowance are better off by its amount than otherwise similarly situated individuals who do not receive the allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.222" offset="2432293">Indeed, the District Court focused on the deduction provision, not the inclusion provision, and it was the state and federal regulation that denied a/or disallowed and itemized deduction that was expressly invalidated by the court.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stephen L. Urbanczyk</label>
            <text syncTime="607.819" offset="2534693">Well, I don’t have a exact idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.985" offset="2547336">I assume that as the parties in this case have stated that the issues upon which the statutory and the constitutional issues turn are very similar in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.539" offset="2589550">They are interwoven and the whole concept of reasonableness which is the appropriate inquiry in the statutory issue also bears upon the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.209" offset="2636257">But, I’m not exactly sure why the court proceeded on.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.428" offset="2645034">What I note in this -- in the Court’s first opinion, the opinion that was vacated by this Court in the first instance when the federal regulation was amended expressly did not rely upon constitutional grounds, but only on the statutory ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.173" offset="2704071">Now, this lawsuit as I said, I think focuses upon the allowance of the reasonableness of the Secretary’s disallowance of an itemized deduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.549" offset="2749524">I think the reasonableness of that regulation rests upon two general propositions.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.999" offset="2775333">One, the disallowance of ordinary expenses such as transportation costs is fully consistent with the Act and is an effective and efficient method of administering the food stamp program.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.639" offset="2825906">The second proposition, assuming that that general approach to transportation cost is reasonable, is that there is nothing in the Act or the constitution which requires the Secretary to treat appellees' training costs, any differently from the analogous expenditures and other households.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.931" offset="2895078">With the first of these propositions, I think we can start with the Act itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.635" offset="2909915">As I mentioned, Congress provided explicitly that it was income that was to determine the amount that a household is required to pay for food stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="711.160" offset="2948054">The Congress provided explicitly that the amount of the household be required to pay is a reasonable investment, but in no event more than 30% of household income.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.225" offset="2992253">Now, that left 70% of household income that the Congress anticipated would be used for the households other non-food expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.331" offset="3024645">And thus it seems plainly consistent as a general matter for the Secretary to disallow itemized deductions for non-food expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.012" offset="3059440">I know by the way that the food stamp program in this regard is different from other programs such as AFDC for example, which seems to be based on actually available income.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.107" offset="3099773">It’s not actually available income that is to key here whereas I pointed out it’s Congress anticipated that much of the income would not be actually available for food or would be not considered as part of the -- but nonetheless would be considered in the Secretary’s determination of income.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.453" offset="3177200">I think an income standard in addition to being consistent with the Act is also an effective and efficient to way of administering the food stamp program.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.505" offset="3221400">We have described this at length in our brief and I use the terms effective and efficient purposely here because those are the exact terms that Congress used in instructing the Secretary on how to administer the food stamp program.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.977" offset="3279287">An income standard, again as we describe in our brief is certainly more effective and efficient than a standard which requires the Secretary to determine each month the amount of food or the amount of household income actually available for food.</text>
            <text syncTime="809.257" offset="3340413">That is the standard which requires the Secretary to allow a deduction for all expenses that reduced food purchasing power and it seems to be the approach that is implicit in much of what District Court said in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.069" offset="3407600">Transportation costs are a prime candidate for disallowance under these general principles that I have talked about.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.771" offset="3438425">Transportation costs are incurred by many households in the pursuit of a wide variety of endeavors.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.627" offset="3461831">At the same time such costs are -- could be reasonably expected to vary widely among households and to depend to a large extent on personal consumption choices.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.335" offset="3500701">For these reasons, it seems especially appropriate that the -- for the Secretary to simply let these expenses fall where they lie and to disallow an itemized deduction for such transportation costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.485" offset="3549288">Appellees in their brief did not appear to express serious disagreement with the forgoing.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.672" offset="3570082">They do not suggest that non-food expenses generally or even commutation costs should be deducted from household income.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.725" offset="3602265">Instead, the principle burden of appellees brief appears to be that their transportation cost should be treated differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.099" offset="3635806">But as I stated earlier, I think the second proposition under which the reasonableness of the Secretary’s regulation rests is that there was nothing in the Act and certainly nothing in the constitution which requires the Secretary to treat these transportation costs indifferently.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.729" offset="3698291">Certainly, a concept of food purchasing power which so occupied the District Court in this case does not sustain that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.095" offset="3727757">Appellee Karen Hein, we know from the record traveled from Muscatine to Davenport, Iowa to attend a training program.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.886" offset="3758895">But certainly, there was nothing in the concept of food purchasing power which required that she -- those expenses be treated any differently than similarly situated individual who travels from Muscatine to Davenport because the only job available to them is there, or a person who travels from Muscatine to Davenport to attend a training program without the aid of an allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.658" offset="3850010">The District Court, however, found that the -- a subsidiary purpose of the Act was to encourage education and as an alternative ground of holding -- it held that the regulation was invalid to that subsidiary purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.271" offset="3904449">But in this respect, the court read the Act for far more than it was worth in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="956.548" offset="3929527">The regulation -- the provision that the Secretary relies upon or that the court relied upon does nothing more than require as a criterion for eligibility that able bodied individuals be either employed, be ready and willing to find employment, to be a mother or caretaker of children or be a student.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.231" offset="4012283">Able bodied individuals in any of those categories are equally eligible under the food stamp program and the Act appears to be neutral with respect to those expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.234" offset="4048332">There thus appears to be nothing in that provision which supports a favoring of transportation, training transportation expenses over say the training transportation -- the transportation expenses of a worker.</text>

            <text syncTime="1123.625" offset="4597844">I’m Lorna Williams.</text>
            <text syncTime="1124.349" offset="4600769">I’m one of the Assistant Attorney General for the State of Iowa and there is a little irony in this particular lawsuit for the reason that the very people that Iowa would like to help under this modification of the regulation prevents them from doing so because they are trying to protect the rights of the trainees in Iowa’s individual program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.097" offset="4707767">It means that first, they are not unlimited sources to go upon, but Iowa is proud that it is high in giving ADC benefits, 8th or 11th depending on how you figure it from the top on ADC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.986" offset="4779342">Iowa has this individual training program which most states don’t have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.704" offset="4798151">It’s had the program since 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.487" offset="4817272">It can continue to provide this kind of thing for the people in Iowa or anyone who comes there and can qualify and it is not limited to a bread and butter course.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.046" offset="4871607">It even offers a Bachelor of Arts degree if someone is in need and eligible to do that kind of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.816" offset="4914657">The particular regulation here in the retroactive aspect is particularly harsh on Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.863" offset="4954781">For here, Iowa all these years has been passing on to the beneficiaries, the trainees, the amount of money you’d thought it would take in administrative time and cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.141" offset="5003891">They’ve already passed the saving on and instead of making a day-by-day calculation of how much did each food stamp and individual trainee for that course spend for commuting, it just gave them across the board allowance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.862" offset="5078810">That’s not unlike the way the WIN program treats the people there also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.562" offset="5097618">The WIN people get a $30.00 a month allowance unaccountable no restrictions on it, plus $1.00 for lunch a day, $1.00 for travel a day whether it's used or not, so that it's about the same in both programs, there’s approximately $60.00 or $69.00 in Iowa in our training program too, $60.00 that's available to this people, they can save it if they want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.894" offset="5218931">They can move to the location of their school if they want to, none of their rights or benefits will be taken away from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.089" offset="5247770">They can -- perhaps they can use it even on household items if they need to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.285" offset="5276505">Maybe they move to the college campus and the rent's going to be $10.00 a month more just because they move to Davenport.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.744" offset="5302314">There is no nothing that in that Title 19, or excuse me Title 20 program which is where Iowa gets part -- its funds for its individual training program that says it cannot be used on that because it’s beyond the expectation of ordinary household item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.253" offset="5376397">Music schools are included in that thing even.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.033" offset="5391548">The WIN program, there is one checking that is required of our people who administer that program also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.546" offset="5421537">They must check at the school to see if someone was intent -- in attendance, but they do not make the people say “Oh, I skipped lunch today and used the dollar for something else or I hitch to ride to school and saved the dollar.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.766" offset="5470438">They have the right to that if they want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.183" offset="5480155">They don’t have to account for the money and it could very well discourage people from coming into the food stamp program if they had to account for of how much money they are going to get, how they spend it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.329" offset="5532714">Same way, it could hurt our trainees if they had to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.624" offset="5545880">'We don’t require of them and yet now, except this law, this regulation as set out by the court, the modification to the regulation would so require so the people may then become discouraged and not want to come into either program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1376.810" offset="5610663">The trainees that add to our area 11 school right there in Encony came to our state house and complained because they felt as though they have been singled out by having to have them be checked at the schools to their school attendance, days in attendance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.887" offset="5682970">Iowa doesn’t really -- Iowa wants to help the people and not hinder them and it’s not uncommon now for people in one program to be recipients and beneficiaries in another welfare program and one should not curtail the activities of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.706" offset="5754232">The federal court under the Eleventh Amendment really shouldn’t be spending Iowa’s money that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1417.628" offset="5773876">When Iowa has determined, it would rather give it to the beneficiaries and have given to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.938" offset="5795088">And now to be called back and spend, we figured 3,400 who have gone through our program since complaint has been filed to review month by month, every single food stamp calculation, recalculate it, month by month.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.699" offset="5866141">It would take one person Your Honors at eight hours a day if you average it, once you’ve identify him, it take eight -- between 10 and 13 years, one stamp person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.928" offset="5915042">If we have to go back now, to carry out the court order, if it took an average of eight to identify the people, locate them, have them go from their records or recollections because food stamp the law says you have to verify everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1466.824" offset="5970631">So, it’s the -- they placed upon the State of Iowa an almost impossible burden to say nothing of the amount of money that would have to be spent on step time to do it at the expense of the very people in the class for bringing the action against the State of Iowa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.157" offset="6043982">I notice, you asked the question a while ago as to why the court went ahead and gave its opinion on the constitutional questions and it’s kind of interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.951" offset="6091212">The federal government, once we got them into the court, took over in the trial at the Lower Court, but the briefs of the appellee in both the first trial before it was remanded and in this trial had contained the constitutional questions and it could well be that the -- it could well be that court wasn’t quite so sure that about why it should have put it on the statutory basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.748" offset="6198314">It to me, it really think -- I really think that Congress in no way intended to encourage the people in the food stamp program to go into education nor to intend to discourage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.847" offset="6242722">We just said you just don’t have to come to work, you don’t have to -- you can get your food stamps without going to work or without applying or trying to get a job if you are bona fide student and I think that’s all what they did.</text>
