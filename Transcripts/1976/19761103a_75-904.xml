            <text syncTime="57.145" offset="329067">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.617" offset="342964">I rise to address the court in a case which has aptly been called by the Court of Appeals, the case of first impression nationally, one which explores largely virgin antitrust territory and one which involves for the first time, since the Clayton Act was passed, that we have a money damage verdict under that act.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.306" offset="453724">I should like to emphasize initially that what we are here for is to argue legal issues, not facts.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="95.973" stopTime="96.778">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="95.973" offset="484339">Okay.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="bernard_g_segal" startTime="96.778" stopTime="538.491">
            <label>Mr. Bernard G. Segal</label>
            <text syncTime="96.778" offset="487578">That we are here to argue the subject of damages has governed by those legal issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.486" offset="518403">There are just a few uncontroverted facts say, in facts, I think are necessary just as background whereas the plaintiffs are subsidiaries of Treadway Companies which is a chain of bowling centers that operates in the United States and each subsidiary operates a different bowling center.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.523" offset="606592">Brunswick Corporation is one of two largest manufacturers and distributors of bowling equipment in the United States and it is the defendant, the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.679" offset="647239">I should say Your Honor that the reason the litigation arouse is that prior to 1964, the bowling industry, really prior to the early 1960s was in the boom period and the bottom fell out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.624" offset="714948">In around 1963, 1964 there was a precipitous decline and the petitioner found itself on the verge of bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.037" offset="772626">It had borrow $300 million because in selling to the bowling centers, the plaintiffs here, is that on conditional sales with a down payment but with a very substantial portion of it, major portion of the money being on a note basis and it had $400 million outstanding with these bowling centers of which a hundred million dollars was more than 90 days delinquent.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.804" offset="903761">What it needed was someway to get cash flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.257" offset="921524">It appraised all of these centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.757" offset="931555">It selected those which it thought would give it cash flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.328" offset="949841">It first tried to get them to pay and then tried to dispose all of them, dispose of the equipment as the Court of Appeals carefully outlines failing roll back, it took over these stations to operate them where it thought they would create a cash flow and what we have involved here are three local markets in which it took over stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.456" offset="1042315">Two of them, it took over station that was one of the smaller bowling stations, one of them it found that bowling centers, I should say Your Honors, it found that it simply couldn’t get the cash flow and after few years it just closed it down and left the market, that was Poughkeepsie.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.179" offset="1121204">The others that remained in the market, the complaint of the plaintiffs is that it should not have taken over those stations, that if it had not done so, those stations, I calling them stations those bowling centers would have folded and let me tell you, your Honor, I don’t do much bowling.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.402" offset="1218066">Those bowling centers would have folded and if they had folded the plaintiffs would have shared with the other centers in each of these three local markets with a business that would thus have been released.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.223" offset="1273341">That is the entire theory of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.269" offset="1285567">Your Honor is there just for some reason or I guess, I know the reason, the respondents endeavored to change that theory here and I therefore read Your Honor, just what the Court of Appeal said, It happens to be at Page 25(a) of the petition for the Writ Of Certiorari, the thrust of plaintiff section fourth theory was that damages were to be computed by first assuming that each Brunswick acquired center would have closed down at the moment of takeover.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.628" offset="1443033">In other words, no one else could have taken over.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.060" offset="1452750">They were just closed down.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.019" offset="1464558">But for the takeover and then by projecting what portion of the closed centers business would have been captured by Treadway centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.418" offset="1510220">Now, I should say to Your Honor, that in these three markets there is no showing of any kind that the plaintiffs had any less share of the business or that the defendant got any more share of the business during the eight years from the time of takeover until the time of the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.915" offset="1592140">There is no showing that there was any difference in facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.725" offset="1607395">Indeed the only showing was that three of the independent centers increased their facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.183" offset="1629234">No showing except that the defendant gave up completely the Poughkeepsie market, gave up one of its bowling centers in the Paramus market.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.747" offset="1667477">The three markets are Paramus in New Jersey, Poughkeepsie in New York and Pueblo in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.107" offset="1696943">I say, there is no showing of any of those because the case proceeded on the rather simple ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.153" offset="1729126">Now at the trial there were two, they were charged of the violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act and the plaintiff withdrew that.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.004" offset="1740515">There was a charge of the violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act and this is important because that the Judge in charging the jury took up every bit of evidence of what was called behavioral evidence that the plaintiffs offered every shred of it, and gave it to the jury and said this is for the Section 2 Sherman Act charge and if you find these things are true, then you give a verdict to the defendant, to the plaintiffs and the jury brought in a verdict for the defendant on the Section 2, Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.765" offset="1919506">Now, when it came to the Clayton Act, Section 7, there the charge the Court restrict of its charge to a structural charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.323" offset="1961825">He said the defendant admits that it's number one in bowling.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.208" offset="1981364">It's a largest manufacturer in bowling and it serves as a banker for those to whom it sales and finally the Court said that the percentage of bowling center facilities in a local market that Brunswick obtained by the mere act of taking over a bowling center, you find that that was more than insubstantial share, were the Trial Court’s words, if you find that was more than an insubstantial share, say beyond ten percent or fifteen percent, then you may find a verdict for the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.787" offset="2131621">Now, that was the only thing that was -- that’s before this court, the only thing on question one, the only thing that was given to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.730" offset="2171431">When everything else had found for the defendant, my friend on the other side has some 30 pages of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.020" offset="2204555">He talks of findings by the jury or I can’t understand if they were finding, they were for the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.506" offset="2230572">But since this is a law case, Your Honor; I don’t argue anything of the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.094" offset="2248858">I have read your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1546.348" offset="6285926">It seems to that the theory of the failing company defense is that in a horizontal acquisition, it doesn’t make much difference whether it goes out of business or its acquired by the competitor, because you end up for the same kind of market, but in the vertical acquisition case, you have really kind of a different theory in the Proctor And Gamble case, in the law, that’s a deep pocket getting into a market, and presumably changing things that would otherwise exist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.405" offset="6366070">Now, one may question that wasn’t in the Proctor And Gamble but it is part of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.479" offset="6382370">Now, how does that theory of the failing company defense fit, when the vice is adding a deep pocket competitor to the market that wouldn’t otherwise be there….</text>

            <text syncTime="1603.970" offset="6516326">Both those cases apply it, the debate is on the failing company in both of them, and they make it categorically so and I think that’s so because whether it is vertical or not, the theory is that they don’t want a company which would disappear from the market to disappear and if the only alternative is for ‘X’ to take it over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.524" offset="6602635">Congress has decided as a matter of Anti-Trust Policy, that it prefers to have that entity remained in the market, rather than to have it disappear and therefore it says, if it’s a failing company, you can take it over.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.576" offset="6658850">Now, the only issue here was, not whether it would apply actually, the issue was had we proved it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.018" offset="6696571">And very simply, this is our belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.987" offset="6708483">That can be no doubt that the theory on which this case was tried, on which the damages were sought, was that if we didn’t take them over, they would have withered and died and left the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.840" offset="6755817">Otherwise there is no damage theory at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.960" offset="6768355">Both the Trail Court, the Court of Appeals felt that it was our affirmative duty to prove it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.733" offset="6791448">I say to Your Honors, having now tried cases for 40 years, that any time I got an admission, I never tried to prove what was admitted by the other party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.912" offset="6832094">And when the admission is the entire theory, the entire basis, the only way that they can prevail at all ,then your Honors, I wasn’t -- I didn’t try the case, but I am frank to say, if I had been there, I would have considered it poor advocacy to see whether you could better that, better the whole foundation stone of the other side’s case, and I say to Your Honors that without the failing company doctrine, there is no claim for damages here, and with a failing company doctrine, we are entitled to judgment, on the matter of damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1773.881" offset="7196032">We have a case, Your Honor of a vertical integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.948" offset="7216303">What has happened is, that a largest bowling supplier, the maker of the equipment used by bowling center operations, integrated forward into the bowling operation business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.963" offset="7284326">It made the pinsetters which are the most costly equipment that a bowling center has to use, had to buy, and it made the lanes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.238" offset="7321420">It represents the -- for each center who buys from Brunswick, perhaps a $700, 000 of investment, if it’s a 40 lane which is not an uncommon size.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.397" offset="7390070">There we start, Your Honor and come in 1960,s and my adversary will have you believe that in 1960”s Brunswick tided on the edge of banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.710" offset="7447330">No such thing, not even in the worst years, which preceded its decision to go into the bowling center operation business, but was it anyways near that, indeed in its worst years, its collection received from bowling center debtors were $87 million and more, taking away interest on debts were like and this has been broken down to the bowling operation, you have a balance on the plus side of cash flow of $32 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.026" offset="7588600">This is the giant which Judge Gibbons referred to coming into the land of the Pigmies which all of the bowling center operated the debt to Brunswick itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.463" offset="7650354">Now, if we cast the case into an abstract, theoretical case, about, is it all right to recover damages for mere presence, which is the language and forgive me, your Honor, is I think it’s somewhat unfortunate language, which is in First questions premise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.734" offset="7743454">If you cast it in so general ways than you discount, the whole factual showing of what this case was about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.663" offset="7779190">The twice pride case, the 10 year case, the case in which Judge Ripple made many findings about predatory practices, a case in which unlike my advisory’s representation to the court, there were independent findings made by judge Ripple on the equity side, in addition to the findings made by the jury itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2103.336" offset="8513857">This court has said in so many words, in IT &amp; T and (Inaudible) is equally acquisition and acquisition itself is what is prohibited under Section 7, providing the whole statute to satisfy, providing there is also the necessary tendency effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.159" offset="8613123">Now, there is no magic in probability as opposed to established lessoning in competition, if the tort is the acquisition and if the plaintiff can show damages causal from that tort then he satisfies, it seems to me, the normal test for a damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.469" offset="8702357">And May I suggest, that here Your Honor, the acquisition itself is contaminated, not just because it is an acquisition but because the Trial court and the Third Circuit agreed, felt that it was wrong to bring into the small markets, the pygmies referred to by Judge Gibbons, the integrated strength of The Brunswick Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.531" offset="8838612">That is vividly illustrated by the circumstance that it is a predator and all these fellows were, it is debtors or at least half of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2258.901" offset="9136094">It had no business being there, when the fox goes into the hen house, it is bad for him to be there from the first, we do not have to wait for former to route him out with shot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.197" offset="9189279">So it is the status, Your Honor, which I think is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.544" offset="9202654">It may not apply to every acquisition but it is seems to me it applies to the acquisitions here and I would like to break down what happened because I think this is critical to first question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2287.656" offset="9251137">Brunswick had many thousands of pinsetters out on the installment plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.707" offset="9283320">Brunswick sold them under conditional bills, sale and with a right to foreclose on the property, in the event of non-payment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.245" offset="9333475">What Brunswick did was in most instances, when it was dissatisfied that it could not get paid, is to repossess both the pinsetters which are automatic equipment for setting up pins in an alley and without which today, there is almost no bowling done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.081" offset="9408812">Both the pinsetters and the lanes which are of thin veneer wood sitting on a cement base and which are easily removable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.454" offset="9450295">They removed them and resold them. Thus step one is, Brunswick exercise to choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.850" offset="9491882">Once it decides to repossess those pinsetters and lanes, the bowling center, as a practical matter could no longer function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.667" offset="9547157">This isn’t the case where the market necessarily put out one of the weak competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2369.460" offset="9578295">Brunswick put out of business it is own customer by deciding to go this route.</text>

            <text syncTime="3206.225" offset="12925417">The two policies are Section 4 of the Clayton Act which is designed to create a private vendors for Antitrust violation in great numbers to augment the forces over the Department of Justice and which provides with no exceptions for threefold damages and for attorney’s fees wherever the plaintiff has been injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of Antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.742" offset="13079435">That policy is an important one and it applies to Section 7 as is indicated by Legislative history not just statements of people which Mr. Justice Jackson said, aren’t read by the President when he signs bills but it's by what the Congress did, 1914 Clayton Act Section7, Prohibition of Acquisition of Stock, directly or indirectly in a competitor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3284.843" offset="13239826">In 1950, once, more, modification of Section7, now, to include the remedy for what had become the lawyer’s device to escape old Section7 and that was to throw the acquisition of assets as well as stock in to Section7 and when that happened, Congress again had a chance that to change the Section4.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.935" offset="13348287">It did not do so, Justice Pastore (ph) in the Antitrust laws, we made again the change this time with Section 4, in which among other things of state was given a right sue or injury done to citizens.</text>

            <text syncTime="3739.831" offset="15059830">Mr. Chief Justice, I do not want to have the records stand where I said we were in serious financial condition and my friend rises to say no indeed things were booming for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.599" offset="15110925">I therefore read to Your Honors just four sentences from the opinion of the Court of Appeals particularly because it is Judge Gibbons to whom my friend refers as having indicated that things were riding very high and handsome for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.664" offset="15183128">I read Judge Gibbons.</text>

            <label>Justice Potter Stewart</label>
            <text syncTime="3774.022" offset="15196607">What page of the opinion?</text>

            <text syncTime="3775.036" offset="15200682">Page 7(a), Justice Stewart.</text>
            <text syncTime="3778.576" offset="15214788">Over the years Brunswick had borrowed close to $300 million in order to finance the manufacture and sale of bowling equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.758" offset="15243523">By late 1964, it's receivables were in excess of $400 million, of which more than $100 million were over 90 days delinquent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.315" offset="15281766">Brunswick was clearly in serious financial difficulty and in effort to refers that it's the theory of riding condition, Brunswick’s management decided on a plan and it's back plan that Your Honors have before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.527" offset="15342579">So, that as in so much that my friend has done, he is simply not arguing this case Your Honors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3816.747" offset="15367448">Let me give you another example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.513" offset="15374553">He took Your Honors time to say that in cases like the movie cases, you don’t have to be precise in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.571" offset="15410811">Your Honor, this is the most precise case, I have known in my entire experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3832.907" offset="15432127">Five witnesses got up and said here is the minimum, here is the maximum and they were identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3837.901" offset="15452084">The jury took the identical figures not a penny difference and he argues to Your Honor, a theory as to where damages can’t be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3847.400" offset="15490119">What we have here, if Your Honors please, is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.362" offset="15513942">We have a judge who frankly says, I am venturing into new ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3859.284" offset="15537661">In my judgment, he relished Your Honors taking certiorari on the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3866.151" offset="15565142">It rides throughout his opinion that he would love to have it determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="3870.293" offset="15581652">He has concluded that if someone is there and admittedly as the questions if Your Honors have indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.222" offset="15609341">If we had forborne, there wouldn’t be a change in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3881.116" offset="15624910">There is not a showing by anybody that the market situation has changed, that anybody has a greater share than before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3888.271" offset="15653541">That anybody has more equipment other than three independents who put in a little more equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.687" offset="15679245">What we have here is a Judge who has concluded that in this limited area of liability namely, Section 7, where we are breaking new ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="3909.196" offset="15737237">If you are don’t deliver what Section 7 says, namely a lessening of competition, you nevertheless can have damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3917.174" offset="15769211">Now, one of Your Honors has asked, are there any cases and I say this again categorically, every case I have read and we have given the quotations in our brief, that has pronounced the new theory that you can have damages under Section 7 says, only if you can demonstrate the damage flows from a lessening of competition or a creation of monopoly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3942.872" offset="15872029">On the second point Your Honor, I think I have said enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3946.548" offset="15886657">The sole question that the Court of Appeals decided against this on the failing company doctrine is that it was our obligation affirmatively approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3958.271" offset="15933573">I have leave Your Honors with a thought, that if anything has been demonstrated this morning by friend’s own argument, it is that these were failing companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3967.626" offset="15970981">Why would we adduce proof?</text>
            <text syncTime="3969.964" offset="15980385">When it ran throughout the case where the case was rampant, where the whole theory of the case was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3975.763" offset="16003581">That if we hadn’t taken over thy would have failed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3978.076" offset="16012777">No, no one else would have taken over, no one would.</text>
            <text syncTime="3980.729" offset="16023435">Why did we, why were we willing to operate some of (Inaudible), because we needed cash flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3985.910" offset="16044124">We would had been bankrupt if we didn’t get cash flow.</text>
            <text syncTime="3988.374">We needed money dollars not profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3991.808">We didn’t worry about depreciation which caused losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3994.807">We needed cash flow and the record shows the cash flow for every center.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.253">I thank you, your honors.</text>
