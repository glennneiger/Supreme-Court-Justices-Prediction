            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100531">We will hear arguments first this morning in 75-661, United States against Antelope.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.933" offset="140237">Mr. Frey, you may you proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="13.463" offset="154343">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.664" offset="167091">This case is here on Writ of Certiorari to review the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, reversing respondent’s conviction for first degree murder on equal protection grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.911" offset="216097">This case began when respondents broke into the home of Emma Johnson, an 84-year-old non-Indian woman who lived on Coeur d’Alene Indian reservation in Idaho.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.405" offset="258102">They robbed her and then they kicked and beat her to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="43.845" offset="275865">Because respondents are Indians and the crime occurred in the Indian Country and because the offences were among those enumerated in the so called Major Crimes Act, the crimes came within the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.768" offset="331558">Respondents were indicted, tried and convicted of burglary, robbery and felony murder and I talk here about respondents Antelope and Leonard Davison, actually Respondent William Davison was convicted only of second degree murder and the reversal of his conviction appears to be inadvertent and not based on any of the reasons given by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.367" offset="425912">Respondents appealed their first-degree felony murder convictions to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="85.257" offset="441481">All three of the defendants were Indians?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="88.186" stopTime="136.819">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="88.186" offset="453184">All three, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.250" offset="457468">They are actually four participants in the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.814" offset="471783">One testified on the behalf of the prosecution and is not involved in this appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.606" offset="498951">The Ninth Circuit reversed on the grounds that the conviction violated equal protection concepts embodied in the Fifth Amendment by allowing respondents to be convicted of felony murder that is without requiring the proof of premeditation or deliberation when a hypothetical non-Indian committing the same crime would have been tried under Idaho law, which has no felony murder provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.145" offset="593096">Parenthetically, I note that Idaho used to have a felony murder provision identical to the federal provision and that provision was dropped about four years ago when Idaho adopted a mandatory death penalty for first-degree murder.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="136.819" offset="647744">What about an act committed a non-Indian in the same circumstances on the same reservation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="144.530" stopTime="247.626">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="144.530" offset="678569">Well, the jurisdiction would depend upon the identity of the victim and I will outline the jurisdictional possibilities as I proceed with the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.432" offset="726216">The Court of Appeals perceived the situation that I have described, the racial discrimination against the Indians, which it found not supported by any compelling governmental interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.969" offset="768325">I think it is best to begin the discussion of the legal issues in this case by outlining the current status of jurisdiction with respect to crimes committed in Indian Country.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.187" offset="805210">If an Indian commits a crime against the person or property of another Indian, jurisdiction over the offense is within the tribal courts, unless the offense is one of the Major Crimes enumerated in 18 U.S.C. 1153 in which case jurisdiction is in federal court under Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.266" offset="881592">If an Indian commits a crime against a non-Indian, essentially the same status applies, except that if it is not a major crime and he has been punished by the tribe, there would be no federal court jurisdiction, if he has not been punished by the tribe, there would be federal court jurisdiction under Section 1152.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.461" offset="970304">Now, if a non-Indian commits a crime against a non-Indian, Section 1152 appears on its face to grant federal jurisdiction over that offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.759" offset="1023489">However in a long line of decisions, beginning with the United States against McBratney in 1881 and going through the Draper case and New York ex rel Ray in 1945, this Court has held that the States have exclusive jurisdiction over this category of offenses.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="247.626" stopTime="251.960">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="247.626" offset="1090990">Even if it is a so-called major crime and even if it is committed on an Indian reservation?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="251.960" stopTime="676.071">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="251.960" offset="1108335">It is treated as though it were committed elsewhere in the State and not within an Indian country for purposes of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.827" offset="1131741">So, the situation is if an Indian is involved, either as perpetrator or victim, it is either federal or tribal jurisdiction, if only non-Indians are involved in the transaction there is state jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.622" offset="1182941">What has now emerged, there is a coherent overall structure under which full recognition is given to the Paramount Federal and Tribal responsibility for regulation when Indians or Indian interests are involved, while the jurisdiction of the State maybe recognized over events occurring within the boarders of the State, not implicating Indian interest, even though the events may take place in Indian Country.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.005" offset="1280534">What has become clear as this Court’s Indian jurisprudence has evolved therefore is the central notion of the allocation of jurisdiction between the federal government and the States is strongly rooted in the presence or absence of impact on the interests of Tribal Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.148" offset="1337063">Now along comes the Ninth Circuit and holds that this guiding principle developed by this court is unconstitutional in its application to a large category of cases; that is all cases involving crimes against the person or property of non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.299" offset="1405713">What it is considered carefully then what this discrimination as the Ninth Circuit found is and perhaps more importantly what it is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.515" offset="1446569">The federal murder statute under which respondents were convicted is plainly not racially discriminatory on its face and for purposes of this argument, I assume that the term Indian and the jurisdictional statute is a racial term, although we actually dispute that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.328" offset="1517831">Any person committing felony murder within an area of federal jurisdiction, Indian or not is guilty of first-degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.548" offset="1550640">This applies to a non-Indian who murders an Indian in Indian Country.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.536" offset="1566627">This applies to a non-Indian who commits felony murder on a federal enclave such as a military reservation or commits felony murder in a vessel on the high seas.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.093" offset="1608841">Indeed, the application of the felony murder statute to Indians by virtue of Section 1153 reflects not a discrimination with regard to Indians, but an affirmative determination by Congress to treat Indians the same way as all other persons within federal criminal jurisdiction are treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.765" offset="1683551">The discrimination comes about then not because Congress has decreed that Indians and non-Indians who commit felony murder shall be treated differently in any respect, but simply because it has allowed the States to assert jurisdiction when no Indian is involved in a crime either as victim or perpetrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.017" offset="1752515">Now inevitably, when some cases are allocated to the jurisdiction of one sovereign and others to a different sovereign, there will be differences in a definition of offense, differences in the procedure and evidentiary rules governing the trial of the case and differences in the punishment provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.971" offset="1824404">It is these differences that are the product of this jurisdictional allocation that the Court of Appeals found invidiously discriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.532" offset="1862647">This case is thus entirely different from the Cleveland line of cases relied upon by the Court of Appeals and heavily relied upon by respondents here.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.755" offset="1899532">Cleveland involved a situation in which an Indian is the victim of an assault and thinking about this case, it can be very confusing and I think one point to keep in mind is that what we might call the Antelope category of cases all involved in non-Indian victims or we might call the Cleveland category of cases all involved Indian victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.989" offset="1988453">Now, under the provisions of Section 1153 as there were in effect at the time of Cleveland decision, if an Indian assaulted an Indian, State Law was referred to provide substance of law and punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.140" offset="2053027">However, if a non-Indian assaulted an Indian, 1152 applied and federal law governed and there were differences which resulted in, for instance in the Cleveland case, a larger punishment being inflicted on an Indian defendant than could have been on a non-Indian defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.908" offset="2132126">But the key factor in the Cleveland case is that both groups of defendants were tried in Federal Court and that Congress had established the standards by which both groups should be judged and the status of the defendant as Indian or non-Indian was the critical factor that activated either State Law or Federal Law applying as a matter of affirmative congressional enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.241" offset="2237452">Now, this direct discrimination would pose a difficult case and it would be legitimately subject to some of the objections wrongly made so that procedures in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.505" offset="2286458">In the present case, the discrimination derives as I have said, solely from the division of jurisdiction between the States and the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.348" offset="2321880">In order for this court to sustain the result reached by the Court of Appeals, it must conclude that this eminently sensible division of responsibility which has so often been endorsed by this court, which allows the States to apply their law in their courts when no federal interest is importantly implicated, but retains the federal governance, the situation where trust responsibilities to the Indian tribes are involved, but this sensible allocation of jurisdiction is impermissible because State law is different from Federal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.384" offset="2465971">We submit of course that this wholly non-invidious allocation of jurisdiction by a Congress and by this Court is fully consistent with the equal protection obligations imposed upon Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.910" offset="2520097">Now, I think it is plain that we need not carry the burden that respondents would thrust upon us of showing a compelling governmental interest to sustain the allocation of jurisdiction that exists in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.282" offset="2569625">But, I would like to outline for the court, the choices that would be available to Congress if the Court of Appeals’ rejection of the present system for administering criminal justice in Indian Country is upheld by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.756" offset="2627512">First of all, Congress could do nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.029" offset="2640573">Such a case, each prosecution for a crime against a non-Indian and Indian Country would be governed by a patch work assortment of the most lenient features of the State and Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.855" offset="2691878">For example, if a Peace Officer is murdered in the course of a felony in State of Idaho in an Indian Country, the defendant could not be convicted of first-degree felony murder because Idaho has no such provision, only the Federal Law does.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.990" offset="2752482">Presumably, however, the defendant, if an Indian could not be convicted of murder of a Peace Officer which is first-degree murder under Idaho Law because Federal Law has no such provision.</text>

            <text syncTime="757.592" offset="3130840">But in our view it does not matter, even if Indian is a racial term, we think it is plain that the arrangement that Congress and this Court have evolved over the years is completely justifiable and does not work any invidious discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.154" offset="3189145">I would like to give another example of what happens under the Court of Appeals decision as we understand and that that is the situation in which an insanity defense is available.</text>

            <text syncTime="789.583" offset="3258840">Yet on the other hand let us say that the State has as Oregon had at least at one time a requirement that the defendant prove insanity rather than the federal requirement that the government bear the burden of proving sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.686" offset="3335222">Presumably, again, under the Court of Appeals’ opinion, you would have to pick the State definition of insanity and federal burden of proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="871.772" offset="3587564">I doubt that the Idaho statute in fact could survive the North Carolina decisions last year, but in principle, we are talking theoretically now and the fact is that we point out in our brief, for instance the manslaughter statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.370" offset="3642004">The federal statute has two degrees of manslaughter with certain punishment prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.349" offset="3661857">The Idaho statute has four degrees of manslaughter, ranging from punishments considerably less than the federal punishment up to punishments considerably more than the maximum federal punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.542" offset="3702608">Now, I do not how you compare these two systems to determine which is more lenient.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.839" offset="3727790">In any event, it seems to me plain that the result of the Ninth Circuit’s holding is that no coherence system of legal rules is applied and the potential for responding litigation over a choice of law is virtually endless.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.260" offset="3781498">Now, Congress would have two alternatives to this chaotic system.</text>
            <text syncTime="924.936" offset="3800201">The first is to abandon federal supremacy in the area and the trust responsibility to the Indian tribes by either (1) turning all prosecutions over to the State Courts under State law which is what has been done in the PL so called PL 280 States.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.762" offset="3867493">Now, there was a time at the time PL 280 was adapted when the sentiment in Congress was very much in favor of the simulation of Indians and PL 280 was a product of that and in five or six dates there is in fact state jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.581" offset="3938755">There since was a reaction to that and then the Indian Civil Rights Act in 1968, Congress drew back from that approach and determined that the tribes should have a say in the turnover of jurisdiction to the States because many of the tribes where extremely reluctant to see their members subject to state court jurisdiction and state law and prefer to maintain the existing system.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.130" offset="4045021">Also, of course Congress could adapt an assimilative crime’s approach under which all Indian defendants and now we are talking about the category of cases in which non-Indians are victims, under which all the Indian defendants would be governed by State law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.249" offset="4101445">Now, if this is what is required by the so-called equal protection violation that we have in this case it is a strange principle because it basically says that, yes, court has recognized over and over again and the Court of Appeals did not dispute that there exists a wardship or trust responsibility towards the tribal Indians, but the only Congress can exercise this responsibility is to advocate its own law making functions and simply say whatever the states do will govern the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.032" offset="4216593">Now, there is a second alternative approach and that is the federal law is everything and is to bring to either for this court to overrule the McBratney, Draper line of cases or for Congress to overrule it by statute and bring all wholly non-Indian transactions in Indian Country within federal court jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1055.320" offset="4321710">That is true, but in McBratney what the court said was that the statute was implicitly repealed by the Colorado Enabling Act which admitted the State on equal footing and there has been a lot of criticism of this line of cases, but it is fairly well embedded in our jurisprudence now and I think it makes a lot of sense and I would think that this Court should only as a last resort, only if it finds that it cannot escape the result reached by the Ninth Circuit should it consider the possibility of overruling the McBratney line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.398" offset="4454098">Now, with regard to the federalizing result, there are some practical problems that I think make it an unsatisfactory course, although possibly one that Congress would decide to adapt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.708" offset="4507284">One is that many reservations have a large percentage of non-Indian population.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.564" offset="4526719">In fact, Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation on which this murder occurred has 2500 non-Indian residents and only 450 Indians, so it is over 80% non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.857" offset="4567888">That is true of a number of other reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.725" offset="4583352">The result is that matters in which there is no serious federal interest would be thrust upon the federal court system, thrust upon the United States’ Attorneys and the Martial Service to deal with, it would be a substantial added burden that is difficult in my view as a practical matter to justify in terms of the federal interest involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1144.388" offset="4678020">At the same time, I think it has an unjustified effect on the States, one that Congress would be reluctant having in the Enabling Act, admitted the States with jurisdiction over wholly non-Indian transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.172" offset="4745207">There is something to be said for the proposition of this should not be taken away from the States unless Congress or perhaps this court finds any compelling federal interest for altering that allocation of responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.865" offset="4803930">Now, what we come down then is what I think the Court of Appeals has done, it has picked some concepts which have merit in other context, the notion that there is should not be a racial discrimination in the administration of Criminal Law and that where statutes discriminate between individuals on the basis of race that discriminate could only be justified if at all by showing a compelling governmental interest then it is imported those considerations into an area where they really do not fit, where they really do not belong and where they really have most unfortunate and unnecessary results.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.019" offset="4960560">I do not believe that the Indians are treated unfairly under the present allocation of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.275" offset="4981563">They are treated the same way in this case that non-Indians, any place within federal criminal jurisdiction in the United States are treated and I believe there are no grounds for finding of an equal protection violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.352" offset="5033912">I would like to reserve the balance in my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.239" offset="5073409">It is the respondent Davison’s position that the statutory framework of 18 U.S.C.1151, 1152 and 1153 when read together provide an impermissible racial discrimination in that when certain conduct is perpetrated within the exterior boundaries of an Indian reservation, that prohibited conduct treats the perpetrator differently depending upon the race of the victim and the race of the perpetrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.481" offset="5242369">In this instance for example, the victim was non-Indian and the defendant was Indian and as a consequence under 18 U.S.C. 1153 of the Major Crimes Act, these Indian defendants were in federal court facing 18 U.S.C. 1111 which is the federal homicide statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1368.024" offset="5572557">It is seems to me that in reaching the question, this statutory framework differs from any other than I am aware of than the federal system in that not only are you considering the territory involved, but you were also in conjunction with that considering the race of the individuals involved, more specifically the race of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.972" offset="5688332">Actually in trying to decide which form you are going to be in and there are three possibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.586" offset="5714872">There can be Tribal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.280" offset="5721560">There can be State Court and there can be Federal District Court as a matter of original jurisdiction and there are four things that need to be considered in order to make the determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.491" offset="5766490">One is the location of the offense whether it was within the exterior boundaries of an Indian reservation that is covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.048" offset="5792717">Secondly, the race of the victim and the race of defendant and thirdly the conduct that is being considered whether it comes within 1153 or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.997" offset="5836498">Fourthly, you have to determine whether or not the State in which the conduct was perpetrated is a State which is affected by Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.921" offset="5880175">Now, this is another matter that further goes to complicate the question and that is that Public Law 280 allowed six days at the inception to have total jurisdiction over all offenses committed on Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.490" offset="5958438">For example, in California, I do not believe there are any excluded reservations in California, in Minnesota, I believe there was one that excluded, but in California for example, under the same facts, since California was a Public Law 280 State, this entire trial would have been in California State Court as opposed to federal court because it is a Public Law 280 State.</text>

            <text syncTime="1642.519" offset="6670536">The answer to that question Mr. Justice is that under the decisions rendered in the Ninth Circuit, the Ninth Circuit has looked at two phases of the substantive crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.086" offset="6744828">One is the burden of proof that the prosecution must meet and secondly they look at the severity of the punishment and when they have found discrimination based upon race, they have opted to give the Indians the benefit of the doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.176" offset="6845138">So in this instance if the court were to adopt the Ninth Circuit standard or opinion in effect the respondents in this instance would be given the benefit of the burden of the Idaho homicide statute and I would assume then the benefit of the punishment provision contained within the federal homicides statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1767.648" offset="7171042">Naturally, if you assume that there could be a convention hat under either one of the statutes then we would not be happy with the death penalty situation, but here the standard that the government had to meet was a lesser standard and as a consequence they did not have to prove premeditation in order to obtain the convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.414" offset="7290160">I do not think there can be any question, but that the classification here is racial.</text>

            <text syncTime="2135.367" offset="8641945">The one comment I might make before I start and it really is not determinant of this case as far as the Idaho death penalty itself is concerned so that is presently on appeal and expectedly overturned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.364" offset="8693981">So, I would like to address just a moment this Indian matter, the one and essential element that must to be present for an individual to come within this federal jurisdiction is the fact that he be an Indian that in addition to be an enrolled, you could be adopted by the tribe and still not come within the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2174.042" offset="8796694">And, as has been stated by the US Government here, that the Indian who comes within the federal jurisdiction here is treated and know differently than any one else who comes within federal jurisdiction, but I think the point we have to make is that the reason that that person is within the federal jurisdiction is because of his Indian blood.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.467" offset="8890317">Add that to his enrolment in the tribe and the location, but there is that one essential element that is necessary and which brings him within the federal jurisdiction of statute.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2228.620" offset="9014973">But under the old cliché having Indian blood is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition?</text>

            <label>Mr. Allen V. Bowles</label>
            <text syncTime="2234.339" offset="9037857">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.457" offset="9042350">Yes, it is absolute and necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.818" offset="9055724">Now, the decisions of course and as the development of law down through the time we started dealing with Indians has assumed this wardship doctrine and the purpose of that of course was to assist and benefit the Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.063" offset="9132733">I think it as the Court stated in the US v. Kagama case in 1886 that from the weakness and helplessness so largely do to the course of dealing of the federal government with them and the treaties that have been promised to them, there arises a duty of protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.177" offset="9205145">I think from that duty of protection, of course this is also with that is the power for the legislation, but from that duty of protection under the Mancari case where they were given the advantage in employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.320" offset="9285811">Their duty of protection to promote the Indian’s ability to function on their own is promoted by that and as a legitimate purpose under the duty of protection which came out of the Kagama case and was later however, in the United State versus the Klamath case in 1938 we find that this wardship doctrine and the duty that the federal government has to the Indian is however subject to constitutional limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.077" offset="9408795">So what we are saying in essence is that it is necessary to have this Indian blood which puts you into the federal jurisdiction, applies a standard to you which does not apply to any other defendants in that State assuming a non-Indian victim and non-Indians defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2394.065" offset="9676707">Now, in a recent case in 1973 of Keeble v. The United States, the language within that decision as Congress extended federal jurisdiction to crimes committed by Indians on Indian land out of a conviction that many Indians would be civilized a great deal sooner by being under the federal criminal laws and taught to regard life and the personal property of others.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.362" offset="9785899">Then a quotation from, I do not seem to have the Congressman here, but this is emphatically not to say, however, that Congress intended to bribe Indian defendants of procedural rights guaranteed to other defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.475" offset="9866356">Of course for this comment it does not exclude just defendants in the federal courts or to make it easier to convict an Indian than any other defendant and I think this is a justification for the type of application that we have in the Antelope case would have to show that this type of treatment is beneficial to the Indian under our duty of protection to the Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.120" offset="9968965">And they are making it easier to convict the Indian than you do to any other citizen say within the State of Idaho, are we protecting the Indian, are we benefiting the Indian to make it easier for him to eventually we hope melt into society and take his place there as all other citizens of the state of Idaho or any other state?</text>

            <text syncTime="2686.653" offset="10847098">One other case that I would like to mention here is the US v. Cleveland case which is was a Ninth Circuit case decided in 1974 and in that case there was a difference in treatment between Indian and non-Indians defendants based on whether he was an Indian or non-Indian and also both parties, whether Indian or non-Indian defendants were tried under federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.539" offset="10954618">As the Ninth Circuit has held on this case, the government should not be allowed to do through a procedural matter what they are not allowed to do through a sustentative matter such as was the case in United States v. Cleveland case in the Ninth Circuit and it is of course again pointed out to one essential element as being of the Indian blood in order to fit into the jurisdictional scheme which applies a different standard to the defendant in this case than it would been have had that defendant been a non-Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.335" offset="11081782">So, if we were to ask that the Court in this case affirm the Ninth Circuit’s opinion, finding that this is a racial classification in that the guardianship interest that the US Government has in the Indian, in the Indian nation, especially in the State of Idaho and the Coeur d’Alene Tribe and Coeur d’Alene reservation is not benefited by the 18 1153 statutory scheme which brings the Indian under federal jurisdiction and the felony murder rule.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="3020.844" offset="12183835">Well, it is certainly at least neutral, but I do not think it has to be benign, it is neutral and it is in further interest of Congress’ responsibility and I find the notion in referring to the Cleveland case Mr. Bowles talked about what the Court of Appeals said, I find the language of the Court of Appeals quite extraordinary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.090" offset="12264815">The Court of Appeals said, the government should not be permitted to accomplish their discriminatory jurisdiction what it cannot do through discriminatory statutory coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.908" offset="12300133">To hold otherwise would allow the government to run rush out over the Fifth Amendment in the name of jurisdictional sacrosanctity employing jurisdiction as in violate tool.</text>
            <text syncTime="3059.663" offset="12339107">Well, the Ninth Circuit is talking as though Congress set about to decide how it could be discriminate against the Indians and impose burdens on them that are not imposed on non-Indians and decided to use the mechanism of jurisdiction, nothing could be further from the truth in this case and I think that concept that the Ninth Circuit apparently has just has no place in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3080.538" offset="12422595">Now, Mr. Justice Marshall raised a point when Mr. Walker was arguing about the effect of the decision on State proceedings and I like to emphasize that in my view the same rule would apply if you had a non-Indian defendant and he were tried in State Court for an offense committed in the Indian country against a non-Indian victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.465" offset="12510366">I do not see why he would not have the same argument any lenient features of Federal Law he would be entitled to, so that the decision impacts is not only on the administration of federal criminal justice, but also in the administration of state criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.040" offset="12564596">We also do not say as Mr. Walker suggested that the only way that the Congressional tribal responsibility towards the tribes can be furthered by federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.201" offset="12613289">What we say is what this Court said in the Sever (ph) Case that rests with Congress to determine when guardianship relation shall cease.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.881" offset="12652054">Here Congress is determined that on the Coeur d’Alene Indian reservation it shall not cease and federal jurisdiction shall be maintained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.677" offset="12683192">One other point, we do not believe that the wardship or trust doctrine requires leniency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.901" offset="12712031">This notion that a benefit to the Indians is to select out the most lenient features of two legal systems or the notion that Congress cannot benefit the Indian interest by applying a coherent body of federally established law seems to be mistaken and there are after all Indians living on the reservation besides these respondents and their rights and interests are also affected by the disposition that is made of the respondent’s criminal activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.548">Thank you very much.</text>
