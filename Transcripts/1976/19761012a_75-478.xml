            <label>Mr. Leonard H. Becker</label>
            <text syncTime="54.251" offset="317453">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.425" offset="334171">This case arises on a writ of certiorari to the Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.858" offset="355905">At issue are the interpretation and validity of two parallel provisions of Federal Law.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.005" offset="384535">The first is a guideline of the equal Employment Opportunities Commission, which was promulgated in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.106" offset="412956">Second is a 1972 amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which adds to that statute a definition of the term religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.052" offset="464679">These provisions require the employer to accommodate all aspects of the religious observance and practice of his employees, unless the employer can demonstrate that to do so would work an undue hardship to the conduct of his business.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.570" offset="542733">Facts of the case maybe briefly summarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.889" offset="556003">The respondent, Paul Cummins, worked for a period of approximately 12 years at the Berea, Kentucky Plant with the petitioner Parker Seal Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.255" offset="589544">He rose to the level of Departmental Supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.380" offset="605949">In 1970, he joined the World Wide Church of God, which observes Sabbath from Friday sundown to Saturday sundown.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.717" offset="643356">He there upon advised his immediate superior that he would no longer be available for work on Saturdays.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.748" offset="675435">He was not discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.163" offset="685152">Contrary, he was granted Saturdays off for over a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.552" offset="710648">During that period of time, management directed fellow supervisors to substitute on Cummins behalf on each and every Saturday that his department was scheduled to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.044" offset="768640">In or about August of 1971, when an increasing work load at the plant had given rise to difficulties with this arrangement, Cummins was requested by his superior, to undertake voluntarily, to approach his fellow supervisors and on his own initiative to offer to relieve them during their respective overtime shifts during the middle of the week.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.784" offset="883579">Cummins did not do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.324" offset="893819">He was then requested to reconsider his position with respect to Saturday work.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.157" offset="917120">He declined to do so and he was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.482" offset="934361">Cummins instituted two proceedings, the first, under Kentucky law, before the Commission on Human Rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.338" offset="969783">That commission applied a state civil right statute which followed the federal law in all pertinent respects, including the accommodation provision which is at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.457" offset="1018266">After a full dress evidentiary hearing, the state commission determined that the employer, Parker Seal had made a reasonable attempt to accommodate Cummins and dismissed Cummins’ complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.893" offset="1076049">Cummins also instituted a federal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.917" offset="1088170">First by filing a complaint with the EEOC and then upon receipt of his statutory right to sue letter, a federal complaint was filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.409" offset="1142086">Cummins agreed that that Court could decide his claim on the basis of evidentiary record that had been compiled before the State Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.714" offset="1175314">On that basis, the District Court again held in favor of Parker Seal.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.845" offset="1199869">The Court of Appeals of the Sixth Circuit reversed that judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.288" offset="1217632">It did so largely on the basis of its conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.290" offset="1237590">That Parker Seal had failed to demonstrate why the accommodation which was supposedly reasonable for over a year had suddenly become unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.655" offset="1287118">We submit that this judgment was erroneous for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.966" offset="1308330">The first reason is that the decision of the Court below in affect penalizes the company for having attempted for over a year to work out an accommodation of Cummins.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.268" offset="1353574">Indeed the Court below has flung that effort of accommodation in the face of the company as an admission against the company’s interest.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="321.730" offset="1387428">Mr. Becker, I take it that there is no question as to the employees’ sincerity of his belief.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.289" offset="1413655">You are not questioning this in anyway.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leonard_h_becker" startTime="330.175" stopTime="376.936">
            <label>Mr. Leonard H. Becker</label>
            <text syncTime="330.175" offset="1421179">That is correct Mr. Justice Blackmun; no issue as such is presented on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.465" offset="1442390">A second reason that the judgment below was erroneous, we submit, is that it is flatly inconsistent with other decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.790" offset="1475618">Both of the Sixth Circuit and of other Courts of Appeals which indicate that the employer stands on firmer ground, when he shows he has made some attempt to accommodation and then can point to that effort in support of his position that the effort is unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.455" offset="1542282">We believe that that line of decisions better comports with the statutory objective here, which most be, one of voluntarism of efforts on the part of both employer and employee to arrive at some mutually acceptable arrangement given the employee’s views.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="376.936" offset="1608215">When you say voluntarism Mr. Becker, there is really nothing voluntary about what the employer is doing. He is being required to do it by an Act of Congress.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leonard_h_becker" startTime="385.417" stopTime="425.296">
            <label>Mr. Leonard H. Becker</label>
            <text syncTime="385.417" offset="1642174">I quite agree and I would say that Mr. Justice Rehnquist that that is a point of great force for us on both statutory and constitutional points of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.950" offset="1676238">Recognizing that though and addressing myself at this juncture exclusively to the statutory argument, I would say that if the thrust of Congress is to achieve an accommodation by the employer of the employee’s religious needs, then that overall objective, putting the establishment cost to one side, that overall objective is better satisfied if the employer can make an attempt at accommodation without subjecting himself to the risk of what happened in this case which was to that attempt was then used against him when he got to Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_blackmun" startTime="425.296" stopTime="431.594">
            <label>Justice Harry A. Blackmun</label>
            <text syncTime="425.296" offset="1801626">In that connection, who has the burden of proof to come up with alternative solutions?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leonard_h_becker" startTime="431.594" stopTime="588.062">
            <label>Mr. Leonard H. Becker</label>
            <text syncTime="431.594" offset="1826808">Under the regulation and under the statute both, the Courts have held that the burden rests with the employer to show the prima facie issue of the reasonableness of the accommodation or the “undo-ness” of the hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.887" offset="1879993">We think we met that burden here and we think we did so by demonstrating the unrealistic nature of the various alternatives which were proposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.521" offset="1918550">I might note in passing in response to your question, Mr. Justice Blackmun that none of the alternatives proposed were advanced before the Kentucky Commission or indeed before the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.262" offset="1957525">They seemed to have risen at the appellant level.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.049" offset="1968705">It is suggested, for instance, below that an alternative arrangement might have been for Mr. Cummins to work on Sundays.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.156" offset="2001097">We submit this was unrealistic.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.185" offset="2009247">The plant rarely has ever operated on Sundays.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.134" offset="2021054">There was no point we submit, in having Mr. Cummins come in to supervise a department where his men were not working.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.597" offset="2046863">Another suggestion which was advanced by the Court of Appeals and which to our surprise has been adopted by the United States as Amicus is that Cummins’ pay might have been cut.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.565" offset="2090749">Now, Cummins was not an hourly employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.090" offset="2104855">He was paid in annual salary.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.169" offset="2113110">He was required to work whenever circumstances required.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.775" offset="2131605">The plant operated on what was known as a 5 plus day schedule.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.896" offset="2148114">That is, it ran Mondays to Fridays on a regular basis, and then worked over on Saturdays when the work load required.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.289" offset="2177685">We fail to understand, how cutting Mr. Cummins’ pay in response to his request to be relieved on Saturdays would on the respondent’s theory of this case any more pass statutory muster than the discharge which actually resulted.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.909" offset="2252081">Now, the third point I wish to make with respect to the judgment of the District Court and why we submitted that judgment was erroneous is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.351" offset="2281861">We think that the overall approach of the Court of Appeals was erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.246" offset="2297430">It assumed that the initial arrangement was satisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.239" offset="2317388">On the record that was not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.885" offset="2328045">It is clear that other supervisors were forced to work overtime on account of Cummins’ religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.995" offset="2352496">They received no extra compensations for their efforts.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.530" offset="2366602">Moreover, to the extent that supervisory personnel were forced to split their time on Saturday mornings as between the department from which Cummins was absent and the department which his fellow supervisors were required to operate, there was a necessary doubling up.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.980" offset="2432431">The plant manager testified at the hearing that that was absolutely not a satisfactory operating procedure.</text>

            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="588.062" offset="2452702">Do you not think this Court would be apt to take the judgment of the Court of Appeals on of a kind of ad hoc factual basis in an individual case where the test is reasonably accommodate rather than to second guess the Court of Appeals on the facts of the case?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="leonard_h_becker" startTime="605.484" stopTime="690.422">
            <label>Mr. Leonard H. Becker</label>
            <text syncTime="605.484" offset="2522396">Well, I would assume, Mr. Justice Rehnquist that this Court would not wish to be put in the position of second guessing facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.070" offset="2544757">The difficulty we have here is the Court of Appeals itself has put itself on the posture of second guessing facts and we have a question on the ongoing administration of the Act as to the manner in which the Court of Appeals should subject to review a judgment of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.804" offset="2603690">We agree that the test under the statute is one of reasonableness.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.373" offset="2618005">In essence, the question whether the employer has acted reasonably under all of the circumstances and so far as the statute is concerned, putting aside the constitutional question, that is a factual issue which we agree must be decided on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.081" offset="2672757">The problem here is two fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.589" offset="2682788">First, the Court of Appeals has injected an undue improper consideration into the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.506" offset="2706508">It has escalated one element to the case to a dispositive level and that element is the fact that this employer made an attempt to accommodate and decided after a year that it did not work.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.231" offset="2757394">Now, that we think presents a question of law which is appropriately submitted to this Court for its review.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.166" offset="2777143">The second problem we have with the manner of which the Court of Appeals disposed of this case is that the Court of Appeals itself put itself in the position of revealing the record de novo.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.126" offset="2816953">Despite the protestations of the majority opinion we submit that the Courts below essentially retried the case and we think that is an improper way for Courts of Appeals to proceed in cases of this sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="693.287" offset="2873587">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.206" offset="2877348">The District Court had before it, the evidentiary record that was compiled before the Kentucky Commission and the District Court also had before it Cummins’ agreement that the case could be disposed off on that record.</text>

            <text syncTime="705.470" offset="2922383">But you do not have in this case than any question of the tried, the Federal District judge’s evaluation of credibility of oral testimony?</text>

            <text syncTime="714.612" offset="2958955">I agree Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.863" offset="2963970">The District Court did not have the demeanor with the witnesses before.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.287" offset="2977659">It did have the record that was compiled before the Kentucky Commission which consisted of a panel of several members who did have the benefit of such demeanor and who did observe the witnesses as they appeared before that commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.807" offset="3031680">Now, in explaining why we think the decision below is incorrect, I wish to revert one last time to the point that we have think that the Court of Appeals has improperly elevated one factor, which is the effort of this employer to accommodate.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.166" offset="3089149">We think the Court of Appeals erroneously concluded that that effort at accommodation was reasonable at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.444" offset="3114227">We think it was an extension of activity in the part of the employer that went far beyond a satisfactory arrangement so far as that employer was concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.496" offset="3158426">Moreover, the Court of Appeals we think erred when it concluded that Parker Seals failed to show why that arrangement suddenly became unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.622" offset="3190922">We think the reason it became unreasonable is perfectly clear on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.248" offset="3205446">As I indicated at the outset, the problem was that Cummins was failing on his own initiative to volunteer to assist his fellow supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.996" offset="3240450">The fact is that at the outset of this arrangement in July of 1970, Cummins expressed great willingness to be cooperative and to assist wherever assistance was asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.930" offset="3276186">But his attitude changed and by the time he was discharged, it is clear from the testimony of his fellow supervisors and of his plant managers that he had not fulfilled his share of the bargain.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.456" offset="3330312">We think it merits emphasis on this case that this is not a case of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.102" offset="3352881">Indeed, there was never any suggestion at any level of these procedures that this company had intentionally discriminated against Cummins because of his religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="823.204" offset="3393319">The facts of the case belie any such suggestion.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.863" offset="3403977">The accommodation that was extended Cummins for over a year shows that this company bent over backwards to avoid discriminating against him because of his religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.551" offset="3438668">The question here is very different.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.555" offset="3446713">It is on the statutory level, whether a company has satisfactorily performed a very different obligation which is to accommodate an employee on account of his religious needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.537" offset="3498645">Now, in underscoring the difference, I wish to point out that it is virtually conceded here by parties that if this case did arise under the basic Anti-discrimination provision of Title VII, Parker Seal would be home free.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.809" offset="3563742">I think it is abundantly clear, for example that this company complied with the requirements which were laid down in the Griggs decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="873.075" offset="3592790">If I may quote just a moment from that opinion, the Court there said that discriminatory preference for any group, minority or majority is precisely and only what Congress has prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.289" offset="3645662">Now, the impact of this particular statutory provision is to require a preference which I submit, worked a discriminatory effect, not against Cummins, who benefited from the arrangement for over a year, but against the fellow supervisors who were required to come in, substitute for Cummins on each and every Saturday that his department was operating.</text>

            <text syncTime="957.839" offset="3931859">I am merely explaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.961" offset="3940323">All I intend to do by this argument at this level is to explain the difference which we see between a discrimination case and a case arising out of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="970.504" offset="3982537">I am pointing to the fact that had this case arisen on to the basic provision of Title VII, this employer would surely have been free of liability and I am merely explaining the added burden which this statute proposes on the employer, the burden, which I hasten to add that I think we met and we met it by relieving this fellow with his obligations for over a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.394" offset="4086086">Now in that regard, we have developed in our main brief, a list of the factors which we think will be pertinent on the statutory level in assessing the reasonableness of an employer’s effort to accommodate on case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.020" offset="4148571">We think this case is an appropriate vehicle for the Court to consider some of those factors and perhaps to advise the lower Courts whose opinions are in some disarray on the subject, what factors may and may not properly considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.961" offset="4200294">One factor as I previously indicated which we think should not be accorded to dispositive significance is the suggestion that because the employer has made an effort at accommodating the employee, he is somehow subject to a heightened obligation to explain why the accommodation is no longer possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.412" offset="4278139">Let me turn now if I may, to the constitutional side of our case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.547" offset="4294648">In the event that the statutory question is resolved adversely to us, we challenge the Federal Constitutionality of both the guideline and the statutory amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1059.428" offset="4338220">We say that those provisions in tandem violate the establishment cause of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.099" offset="4368836">Now, the Court is fully familiar with the three-part test or guideline which is developed in the context of the various school paid cases which have been before it over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.469" offset="4418364">Those principles are discussed in full in our briefs and I shall not labor them here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.497" offset="4438426">I wish to make on following few points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.868" offset="4451905">First, this statute undoubtedly, indisputably aids religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.786" offset="4475624">That is its whole point and purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.407" offset="4486073">Senator Randolph said so, when he introduced it on the floor of the senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.847" offset="4507912">The language of the statute and the guideline itself makes it clear that that is all that the statute and guideline are concerned with.</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard H. Becker</label>
            <text syncTime="1116.926" offset="4568202">It is an attempt by Congress to force the employer to make accommodations or to permit the employee to engage in one kind of activity, which is religious activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.217" offset="4621388">I do not, in any sense, Mr. Chief Justice denigrate the motives of congress in passing the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.802" offset="4643644">It is clear that its instinct was highest purity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.286" offset="4657645">The objective was to assist in the ability of certain employees to enjoy their religious activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.958" offset="4696307">Now, I note that immediately the question is presented onto the establishment clause because of the narrow focus of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.935" offset="4728176">It is devoted solely to the assistance of religionists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.809" offset="4743745">Moreover, we submit that the statute is devoted solely to the assistance of certain religionists, namely, those who wish to observe their Sabbath on a Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.680" offset="4787213">That was the precise purpose to which Senator Randolph said when he was introducing this legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1178.483" offset="4814380">I mean, supposing you get somebody who does not want to eat meat on Friday, you will have some sort of an argument that maybe a fish ought to be served in a cafeteria on Friday, would it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Leonard H. Becker</label>
            <text syncTime="1188.380" offset="4853982">That is correct under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.929" offset="4860147">That is quite right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.750" offset="4863490">The statute reaches all aspects of observance and practice of religion, but I know that the guideline which antedated the statute is called, quote “observance of Sabbath and other religious holidays.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.067" offset="4920751">The introductory section of that guideline says that several complaints filed with the commission have raised a question concerning employees who regularly observe Friday evening and Saturday or some other day of the week, as the Sabbath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.890" offset="4979996">The guideline was directed to the problem of the Saturday observing religionist and that means it was directed to one particular subgroup of religious practitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.841" offset="5027853">We submit that that further points to the constitutional impropriety of this legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.352" offset="5049900">Now, I want to stress the difference between this case and the Sherbert v. Verner decision of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.258" offset="5073515">That was the case in which the Court dealt with the Seventh Day Adventist who was deprived of unemployment compensation benefits under a South Carolina statutory scheme which denied benefits to those who are unavailable for work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.686" offset="5135268">Now, the argument that has been developed on the other side of this case is that as part of a statutory scheme that deals with discrimination, Title VII, the Congress could pick up the notion of discrimination that was developed in Sherbert and simply apply that pari pasu to private people.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.121" offset="5204963">We think that argument is wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1278.324" offset="5213740">The first point is that Sherbert was not a case of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.586" offset="5230876">The appellant in that case presented in a claim of denial of equal protection, which was not passed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.424" offset="5254178">What was presented there was the problem arising from the state’s even handed application of officially neutral unemployment compensation scheme which resulted in governmental pressure on the appellant because of her religion and that introduced an improper infringement on her free exercise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.844" offset="5335889">That I submit is very different itself from a discrimination case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.856" offset="5351876">Now, there is another point on which Sherbert precedent is different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.337" offset="5369848">In that case the Court noted that a separate state statute expressly saved out the Sunday worshipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.941" offset="5392209">State laws then linked together, clearly separated the Saturday from the Sunday observing worshipper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.882" offset="5420003">That is not true here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.777" offset="5427631">Parker Seal on rare occasions operated its Plant as on Sunday and one of the witnesses at the hearing, Web, testified that as a supervisor, he was on occasion required to come in on Sundays even though to do so violated his religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.383" offset="5486041">It is clear then that this company did not discriminate between Saturday and Sunday observers as did the South Carolina statutory scheme considered as a whole, in Sherbert.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.975" offset="5532330">Now, both the Sherbert precedent and the other precedents which were relied upon by the respondent go to the notion that where the government infringes or is about to infringe upon the free exercise rights of citizens then relief may and in some cases, must be in order, even though the result might abstractly be deemed to give rise to some establishment question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.482" offset="5634416">To rephrase the proposition, an establishment clause objection will be overridden where in order to satisfy it, the government will be required to infringe upon a free exercise rights of the affected persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.488" offset="5686452">This Court’s decision in the Yoder case, the Amish School Children case, is a conspicuous illustration of that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.203" offset="5725322">This is not that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.325" offset="5733786">This is a case in which the government is saying to one private person, “You have got to change the way you do business in order that another private person may enjoy his religious rights.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.266" offset="5773596">Now, once again the purpose maybe thoroughly understandable, but the problem is that it amounts to something which goes to the core of the establishment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.916" offset="5812153">It is governmental pressure coercion being leveled against one person on account on another person’s religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1444.662" offset="5879131">Candidly, I am not sure that they can be easily reconciled with the Yoder decision, but they certainly rested themselves on the proposition that in overriding non-sectarian secular purpose had motivated the state legislatures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.821" offset="5935765">The interest in gendering a uniform day of rest and the Court said although those statutes may once have had their origins in religious notions, those religious notions had eviscerated and there was now a secular purpose which overrode the objection of the Orthodox Jew who was forced to choose between his religion and his livelihood.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.938" offset="6020192">That is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.449" offset="6026253">There is no nonsectarian purpose to this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.566" offset="6038792">The statute on its face is directed to the protection and enhancement of certain religious groups and indeed the language of Senator Randolph makes it clear that he was sponsoring it because Saturday observing groups, of which he was a member, were having difficulty in keeping up their congregations because some of the members had to work on Saturdays.</text>

            <text syncTime="1586.189" offset="6445257">Mr. Chief Justice and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.291" offset="6457691">I would like to begin by clarifying one factual error I think that has been made and this is a question of whether or not the company did in fact accommodate Mr. Cummins for a year?</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.012" offset="6508578">On page 173 of the record and the question was directed to Mr. Hedick who was the plant manager and he was asked, “When did you become aware of Paul’s religion’ and his answer was, “Not until the summer of 1971 when we were having our vacation period.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.455" offset="6570331">Later on, on page 178, the answer to a question was, “I asked him I think it was two weeks before he had left,” I asked him if there was any, “I knew he had adopted this religion a year-and-a-half and I asked him if there was any possibility of his being able to change his ideas or anything like that and he told me that he was firmly fixed with his religion.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.285" offset="6649639">“Is that when you decided to fire him?”</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.240" offset="6657476">“It was after that.”</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.607" offset="6662909">So the company did not accommodate Mr. Cummins for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.069" offset="6676806">The fact of the matter is, Mr. Hedick the plant manager was there for a year before he was even aware of the fact that Mr. Cummins was not coming in to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.498" offset="6718498">Mr. Cummins of course had been told by previous supervisors, that as long as it did not pose any problems, he did not have to come in and work on the shift on Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.579" offset="6762801">This was based on the past practice of the company that the particular department that Mr. Cummins worked in, the Bunberry Department, historically, operated second shifts then they never did have a supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.046" offset="6816614">I think the record amply shows that most of Mr. Cummins work involved scheduling production and physical presence was not always necessary because the company had determined that due to the financial situation, they never did have a supervisor on the second shift and over the years the fact that when they did have one because production was low and any problems, any deficiencies in production started back in 1968 and actually reached their peak in 1970 and were totally unrelated to any problems or any difficulties that came about because of Mr. Cummins adoption of his religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.885" offset="6971990">I think secondly, more importantly is the question of what Congress intended by the enactment of this amendment and that was to put a burden on the company to attempt to reasonably accommodate the religious needs of the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.836" offset="7035833">I do not accept the Counsel’s argument that without this amendment, that Mr. Cummins would not have been protected.</text>

            <text syncTime="1888.285" offset="7653577">I think it boils down to basically that each case has to be looked at in its own particular fact situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1947.610" offset="7890873">The main thing that the Court of Appeals did in this instance and the important thing I think is that the Commission on Human Rights, who is the actual trier of facts, misapplied the law because they reasoned that as long as this policy was applied uniformly, that is was there for legal and that the company was able to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.193" offset="7977286">The only problems and the undue hardship is reflected in the record and that was testified to, is the fact that there was consternation among the other employees which I think is probably going to be true in most instances, particularly here where the company did nothing to try to eliminate that problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="2467.269" offset="9969593">And I base that on the argument that I think that a proper interpretation of Griggs and the disparity affect cases compels a finding that a reasonable accommodation would have had to have been made.</text>

            <text syncTime="2532.608" offset="10230922">The United States does not agree with the petitioner that the duty to reasonably accommodate an employee’s religious practices, so long as it does not cause an undue hardship on the operation of the business, is really totally separate duty from the basic obligation under Title VII of the Civil Rights Law, to avoid discrimination of the basis of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.206" offset="10333322">Indeed, the reasonable accommodation requirement was first adapted by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in 1967 as an interpretation of the basic obligation five years before the Congress amended the statute to indicate its agreement with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.048" offset="10428721">Under this Court’s decision in Griggs, the basic prohibition is directed not merely to the motivation of employment discrimination, but to the consequences of practices on persons because of their race, religion etcetera, regardless of how well motivated and evenhandedly applied the particular employment practices might be.</text>

            <text syncTime="2638.948" offset="10656300">Similarly, a facially neutral across-the-board rule, that when called upon to do so, every employee must work on Saturday has a grossly disparate impact on certain employees because of their religion and similar approach should be taken under the Griggs test itself, whether there are sufficient reasons related to the business needs of the employer to require an employee to be put into the position of having to choose between the dictates of his religion or possibly forfeiting his livelihood in that situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2688.685" offset="10855249">Well, our point is that the 1972 amendment really represents a reasonable legislative solution to the question of how do you determine when a practice has the forbidden consequence of an employment practice that discriminates on the basis of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2708.948" offset="10936228">It is not simply a motivational question and Congress recognized that in adapting the 1972 amendment in light of EEOC’s experience in trying to make that determination in these cases where persons complained that they were being forced to the choice between the dictates of their conscience and the employers’ demands, that they observe a facially neutral requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2737.882" offset="11052003">So it is an outgrowth and a reasonable legislative drawing of the line to determine when an employment practice is justified in terms of the needs of the business or where it has the forbidden consequence because of its disparate impact.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.510" offset="11694511">But the circumstances of a case will dictate what can be a reasonable accommodation and there can be several possibilities for a reasonable accommodation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.339" offset="11745815">As I read the record in this case, I think the company did to the extent it was aware of the problem, make a reasonable accommodation for the initial period in which the respondent here started to observe Saturday as his Sabbath and it was only during the summer of 1971, when the increased work load came along due to a strike in a Lexington plant and to vacation schedules in the plant, that the company really did not fulfill its obligation by making further adjustments to utilize the respondent and have him carry his full share of the extra work load along with the other supervisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.127" offset="11941002">As Mr. Hogan said, the other supervisors were assigned the duties that they had and were told when they would have to work on Saturday to cover for Mr. Cummins etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.910" offset="11984156">Yet the company refused to assign Mr. Cummins to extra work during the week to cover for the other employees where it could very well have equalized the assignments out by giving Mr. Cummins extra hours during the week and if those extra hours were on the second shift, then have the second shift supervisor sometimes relieve the first shift supervisor, so that all of them could have had some relief.</text>

            <text syncTime="3049.593" offset="12298880">The case was submitted to the District Court on the record that had been developed before the State Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3055.128" offset="12321032">And the District Court wrote a very short opinion which merely says that, on that record it found that the company had made a reasonable accommodation and no more should be required of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.891" offset="12380068">And so the Court of Appeals quite properly had to look to the underlying facts to determine whether applying proper legal standards to those undisputed facts, that result was correct or not and reached the conclusion that the District Court erred in that regard and the only findings that we have are reflected in the Court of Appeals’ opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.110" offset="12488947">But nothing was brought out into the hearing as to any reasons why the company could not have made assignments of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.323" offset="12529802">In the limited time remaining, I would like to say a few words about the constitutionality of the 1972 amendment to Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="3117.465" offset="12570344">There is no general principle under this Court’s decisions that it is necessarily a violation of the establishment clause for one person to be required to adjust his conduct in some way, because of the religious practices or observances of another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.588" offset="12650801">In fact, this Court’s decisions hold precisely the opposite that it is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.312" offset="12681730">It is exercise of legislative power in particular circumstances to require individuals to adjust their conduct in a way that will further in a neutral way the free exercise of religion and avoid unnecessary clashes with religious conscience.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.944" offset="12784235">One example of that or rather simple one is Gallagher against Crown Couture Markets.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.413" offset="12810148">One of the Sunday-closing law cases in which 8 Justices upheld against an establishment clause attack the constitutionality of provisions of that particular Sunday-closing law which forbad the carrying on of certain activities within a prescribed distance of a place of worship on Sundays.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.904" offset="12896143">This affected where people could parade.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.489" offset="12906488">It affected where people could conduct athletic events.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.829" offset="12923833">All in deference to furthering the free exercise of religious observances at the churches that were being protected and this Court held that this does not force anyone else to attend those services to adapt any kind of religious belief or practice and that it was a permissible exercise of state power to reach other persons in this way in order to protect the free exercise of religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3235.266" offset="13041593">Another example of that which we developed in our brief at some length is Zorac against Clausen in which those school children who did not choose to attend the religious instruction given outside the school room, were kept in school at the regular attendance, even though the state forbad continued instruction during that period which would cause educational problems and cause those who stayed behind to forge ahead of their classmates and in dissent Mr. Justice Jackson went so far as to say the school is being used as a jail for those students who chose not to go to church in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.635" offset="13222988">Nonetheless, that was upheld and probably the most extreme example is the Court’s upholding of the constitutionality of the conscientious objectives provisions of the selective service laws, even though they necessarily mean that some people will be conscripted into military service in place of those who are the conscientious objectors or will be sent into combat in place of those who object to that kind of military service based on their religious scruples.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.616" offset="13362899">This kind of accommodation has been called in opinions of this Court among our finest traditions and is not really different in kind from the adjustments that were made by the clerk in the argument schedule of the Court last week and this week because of religious holidays in re-arranging some of the oral arguments of the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.589" offset="13758811">Now, the petitioner here has not discriminated against Mr. Cummins.</text>
            <text syncTime="3421.656" offset="13787128">What the petitioner wants is not equal treatment?</text>
            <text syncTime="3425.038" offset="13800607">He wants preferred treatment and it is a little curious to find provision of the statute that 701, that uses term discrimination in a context that results in the argument being made here that because the employer -- the equal treatment to Mr. Cummins.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.993" offset="13904470">The company, that employer, is charged with discriminatory practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.625" offset="13922965">The question I lead up to ask is whether or not in connection with your constitutional argument, the employer is really not being compelled by law to accord a privilege, a benefit to an employee because of his religious choice or beliefs.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="3476.056" offset="14004676">Well, the treatment that has have been accorded is facially equal treatment, just as Mrs. Sherbert was afforded facially equal treatment by South Carolina in refusing her unemployment compensation benefits along with anyone else who refused to take a job that required work on Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.260" offset="14081476">Some people might have preferred to be at home with their school aged children, etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.864" offset="14095895">There may have been substantial reasons why they refused to take such employment, but if the dictates of one’s conscience, one’s religion forbid working on that day and leave the person with no conscientious choice, you are into a situation where the facially equal treatment has grossly disparate affects on individuals and causes a great hardship of having to choose between the dictates of one’s most deeply held beliefs and ones livelihood.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.341" offset="14229851">And there is an area where the legislature, I think quite properly can go behind facially equal treatment to see if there are ways of accommodating people so that they can carry their full share of the work responsibility and still not have their beliefs compromised in this way in comparison with others who might be observing their Sabbath on a day when the company ordinarily does not require them to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.359" offset="14361926">They may not be faced with the same problem at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3569.365" offset="14377913">It is an area that has required difficulties and adjustment before the 1964 law was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3576.908" offset="14408111">Those difficulties were faced by employers in making ad hoc decisions and they were faced in the collective bargaining process and as part of the 1964 concern with the equality of employment opportunities, Congress has stepped into this field in exercising its commerce power.</text>

            <text syncTime="3661.116" offset="14744986">Well, there are several points to be made in response.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.892" offset="14756062">First is that the company does have a right to challenge the statute under the establishment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.900" offset="14776124">Of course, the company does not have an independent free exercise claim nor are we here today asserting on behalf of some third person any free exercise claim, but the company is coerced by government to undertake activity with respect to and in favoritism of a private person’s religious activities and that gives raise to an establishment clause objection here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3691.027" offset="14864627">The second point is that the government is a much larger employer than the Berea Kentucky Plant of Parker Seal and to the extent that we deal on a statutory plain at least each of these cases must turn on the number of fundable employees who may possibly be substituted for one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.684" offset="14935262">That is not a possibility here where we dealt with a limited number of supervisory personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3713.742" offset="14955428">On the constitutional plain, I adhere to my answer that the government must make allowances as it did in the conscientious objector cases where a failure to make such allowance would give rise to a substantial problem under the free exercise clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.401" offset="15014047">This was the point with Mr. Justice White made in his dissent in the Welsh case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3732.097" offset="15028885">It is the essence of the Yoder decision of this Court.</text>
