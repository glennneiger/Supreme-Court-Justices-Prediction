            <label>Mr. William F. Sheehan, III</label>
            <text syncTime="60.146" offset="343960">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.176" offset="360051">This case is here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.341" offset="384711">That court affirmed the order of United States District Court, suppressing for use in evidence in respondent’s perjury prosecution, the testimony that she previously gave before the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.925" offset="435075">This case and the next one following it both involve the broad question whether the constitution requires that the government give any sort of warnings to Grand Jury witnesses when the government has reason to believe that the witness maybe indicted on the basis of the testimony that is sought from them.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.801" offset="522533">This case, however, can be decided, and indeed, we think that it should be decided on a more narrow ground, for this is a perjury case and there are special policies applicable in such cases as this Court recognized last term in United States against Mandujano.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.185" offset="592123">Those policies in our view apply here and they warrant a reversal without consideration of whether warnings are required.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.610" offset="625768">The facts were these.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.342" offset="632769">On September 7, 1973 the respondent Rose Wong appeared pursuant to a subpoena before a Grand Jury in the Northern District of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.047" offset="675610">She was called to testify as part of the government’s investigation into gambling and bribery in the China Town section of San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.257" offset="708420">The government already had evidence that she had paid bribes to certain police officers who were cooperating with the FBI.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.591" offset="737782">It was thought that she or other persons unknown to the Grand Jury might also have paid bribes to other police officers who were not cooperating with the government and it was in part to learn the identity of these other officers that she was called to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.151" offset="807999">When she appeared before the Grand Jury, the Grand Jury formally administered the oath and right after that, the government attorney told her what the nature of the Grand Jury investigation was and what its purpose was, that it was investigating bribery and gambling in China Town.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.670" offset="886053">She was told the she had been called because it was thought the she had information that might be helpful to the government’s investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.237" offset="916355">At that point, the government attorney gave her a series of warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.389" offset="932968">She was never told that she was required to answer all the questions that were put to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.985" offset="955329">She was told instead that she could refuse to answer any question that she felt might tend to incriminate her.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.013" offset="979466">This advice was repeated twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.758" offset="986363">She was told this was a constitutional privilege of hers.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.770" offset="1002454">She was asked if she understood and she said that she did.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.661" offset="1018023">She was then told that anything that she said could be used against her in a subsequent prosecution and she said she understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.327" offset="1048639">She was told that she had the right to consult with an Attorney before answering any questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.430" offset="1069119">She said she understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.323" offset="1076642">She was asked if she had already consulted with a Lawyer, she said she had not.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.659" offset="1093987">She was told that she could stop the questioning at any time that she felt necessary to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.334" offset="1112691">She said she understood that.</text>

            <text syncTime="375.311" offset="1604629">We do not contend -- we do not contest the fining of the District Court that she was unable to understand the warnings regarding the privilege and she was then in effect in the position of one who had received no warnings.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="387.812" offset="1654575">Is that the predicate for your suggestion that the case could be decided on a narrow ground?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_f_sheehan" startTime="395.204" stopTime="757.791">
            <label>Mr. William F. Sheehan, III</label>
            <text syncTime="395.204" offset="1684146">The predicate for our suggestion that the case can be decided on a narrow ground is because we think that it does not matter whether or not she had received warnings, effective or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.815" offset="1734614">We think that this case is controlled entirely by United States against Mandujano which was decided last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.552" offset="1765543">In that case as in this case, the Court of Appeals had held that the government’s failure to advise a potential defendant of the privilege against self incrimination was a bar to the use of the witnesses’ testimony and a subsequent prosecution for perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.075" offset="1827715">This Court reversed, although there were several opinions, all of the justices who participated agreed that whether or not warnings were required, a witness could not commit perjury and thereafter claim that the privilege self incrimination was a protection from prosecution for perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.780" offset="1902529">And indeed, all of the justices were in agreement that on the facts of the case in Mandujano, there was no due process violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.572" offset="1933667">The facts here are in all relevant respects the same and we believe the results should be as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.996" offset="1967313">Now, although the Court of Appeals' rule that its result could not be sustained under the Self Incrimination Clause, respondent has argued that indeed, her position is supported by the Self Incrimination Clause and accordingly, I will take that matter up first.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.494" offset="2029380">It is well settled that that constitutional provision does not protect against the crime of perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.081" offset="2055711">The opinions in Mandujano to that effect did not state a new doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.104" offset="2071803">In the Glickstein case and the Knox case and the Bryson case, this Court said that coercion may not avoided by perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.483" offset="2105344">One central rational behind those cases applies squarely here.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.030" offset="2131466">In making the statements that are the subject of the indictment in this case, the respondent was not indeed incriminating herself in regard to a past crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.159" offset="2163963">She was instead committing a new crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.692" offset="2178173">However, broad the protection afforded by the privilege, it is not a license to commit perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.526" offset="2213491">The respondent argues that this case is not the same as Mandujano, and that the use of her testimony in the prosecution for perjury would violate her privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.561" offset="2253615">She says that it was important to the result in Mandujano that in that case, the witness had received warnings and understood warnings apparently, and that she not having understood them and having been in the position therefore of one who had not received warnings will somehow compelled against her will to lie in response to the questions put by the government attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.016" offset="2351417">In our view, it was entirely irrelevant in Mandujano that the witness there had received warnings.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.941" offset="2379107">And the reason that it was irrelevant is because even if the witness had been compelled to testify in Mandujano, that would not have protected him from a prosecution for perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.320" offset="2428635">In support of this proposition, I rely upon the cases that the Court in Mandujano relied upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.174" offset="2456116">The first of those was the Glickstein case.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.340" offset="2468760">There, the defendant testified under the compulsion of the statute that granted him immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.485" offset="2493315">This Court said that as a constitutional matter, the privilege against self incrimination could be overborne and the government could compel testimony, even incriminating testimony, provided that it granted an immunity co-extensive with the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.434" offset="2557158">The Court then said that as a corollary to the power, to the government’s power to compel testimony, it must also have the power to assure that whatever the testimony is given in response to that compulsion would be truthful.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.591" offset="2613687">In that case, the statute in question was held to confer an immunity no broader than the constitution and the use of the defendant’s testimony was upheld not withstanding that he had given it under compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.026" offset="2671470">The Knox case and the Bryson cases are both much the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.959" offset="2687248">In Knox, the federal statute made it criminal for certain persons to fail to file a certain form.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.033" offset="2715460">In response to this compulsion, Knox filed a form that contained falsehoods, and he was then prosecuted under another statute forbidding false statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.556" offset="2753599">Even though under Marchetti and Grosso, under those subsequent cases, Knox would have been protected by his privilege from filing any form at all, his filing of a false form was held unprotected.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.529" offset="2805530">The court noted that the prosecution was not based on any incriminatory information that was given in submission to compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.701" offset="2834160">Neither was the prosecution in Mandujano, neither is the prosecution here.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.143" offset="2855894">When each of these witnesses responded to any pressure that they may have felt that they were under by giving false testimony, that as the court said in Knox was simply not testimonial compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.738" offset="2906363">In Bryson, the Court put the matter quite simply.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.367" offset="2916812">There is no privilege to answer fraudulently a question that the government should not have asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.398" offset="2940949">There is therefore no meaningful difference between this case and Knox, and Bryson and Glickstein, whether or not the witnesses in those case knew that they had a privilege was whether or not they knew that they had a privilege was not important since they cannot realistically have exercised it anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.436" offset="3017122">Whether or not the respondent here knew that she had a privilege also did not matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="732.563" offset="3033631">Even assuming then that somehow, her failure to know of her privilege resulted in a situation where the government was compelling her to give answers against her will.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.072" offset="3079711">There is nothing in the Self Incrimination Clause that requires that her false testimony be suppressed in the prosecution for perjury.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.978" offset="3119313">We turn now to the Due Process Clause which was relied upon by the court below.</text>

            <text syncTime="788.122" offset="3255881">And our position is that even though the defendant in Mandujano received warnings, whether he understood them or not, whether he received the warnings or not was entirely irrelevant to that decision which was another in a long line of cases in this Court saying that a response to compulsion by perjury is not protected by the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.489" offset="3353370">Now, the Court of Appeals I think agreed pretty much with so much of what I’ve just said, and they rested their result instead on the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.157" offset="3408018">We think that the due process analysis adds very little to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.454" offset="3429230">To the degree that any constitutional policies would appear to be implicated in questioning witnesses in circumstances like those here, those policies in our view are fully accounted for by the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.754" offset="3478340">And indeed, the court below did acknowledge as much when it said that the procedure followed here by the government was unfair because of what the court perceived as the threats that it posed to the value protected by the privilege, the values protected by the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.651" offset="3538004">There is a quotation from the court’s opinion at page 2a of our appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.304" offset="3560573">Since there have been no values protected by the privilege that have been violated here, in our view, that should end the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="871.270" offset="3588472">But assuming that there are some values having nothing to do with the Self Incrimination Clause that are somehow implicated in this case, we submit that the government’s conduct did not violate the Due Process Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.312" offset="3640613">We think it is not automatically unfair to call before the Grand Jury a witness whom the government has reason to believe is involved in a crime under investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.707" offset="3678229">As this Court said in Michigan against Tucker, subject to applicable constitutional limitations, the court has not forbidden all resort to the defendant to make out its case and indeed, we find support for that proposition in the Schmerber case and the handwriting and voice exemplar cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.578" offset="3765687">It is important to the Grand Jury’s task to be able to call before it witnesses who have some knowledge of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.250" offset="3792332">The facts in this case are illustrative.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.045" offset="3803512">When the Grand Jury called the respondent to testify, so far is it knew, it was facing a wide spread system of police corruption in San Francisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.822" offset="3842696">In fulfilling its responsibilities of determining whether crimes had been committed and if so by whom, the testimony of witnesses like respondent who by virtue of their involvement in the crime are in the position to know something about it, is essential to the Grand Jury’s task.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.390" offset="3912913">Thus, we say that without more it could not have been a violation of due process simply to call the witness in front of the Grand Jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.081" offset="3943737">Once she appeared, as I pointed out earlier, the governments conduct was beyond reproach.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.498" offset="3977383">Her counsel said at the hearing on the motion to suppress, I want to make it clear that no criticism is intended here of the prosecutor who appeared before the Grand Jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="1034.736" offset="4242265">I would assume from the argument of the government that the government would concede that effective warnings concerning the Fifth Amendment privilege must be given to a putative defendant Grand Jury witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.489" offset="4325334">Although, this Court reserved that question specifically in Mandujano, I think it has to meet that issue squarely here and I think that after cases like Beckwith and Goner last term, there can hardly be any doubt that the Fifth Amendment requires that an uninformed ignorant witness, that is ignorant of the Fifth Amendment privilege, be effectively informed of his rights to decline to answer questions, the answers to which would incriminate him, or else, the Fifth Amendment would virtually be rendered meaningless before Grand Juries.</text>

            <text syncTime="1102.234" offset="4512266">I believe it is, but I think before we can complain of what happened to Mrs. Wong, it has to be held that she had a right to be warned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.936" offset="4559078">Now, whether you consider that a formula to ensure the infective enforcement of the Fifth Amendment, or a right compelled by the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.009" offset="4611427">I think it must be clear to this Court by now that such effective information to an ignorant witness, subpoenaed before a Grand Jury is necessary in order that the Fifth Amendment have any meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.351" offset="4668792">Now that being the case, I think it also important for this Court to understand that we also rely on the Due Process Clause here for our contention that the Court of Appeals must correct in affirming the order of the District Court suppressing her testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.881" offset="4742875">Our position is that Mrs. Wong was placed in a cruel Trilemma to use the language of Murphy versus Waterfront and other cases, without knowing that she had a right to decline to answer, she had the option only of incriminating herself or of perjuring herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.587" offset="4849768">And what the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said and what the government, I think fails to understand is that very Trilemma or dilemma as it's been called, is so unfair, is so essentially wrong that it in and of itself violates due process, and this is true whether the dilemma that the witness faces is created by intentional activity on the part of the government, declining to inform witness of the privilege or whether in this case, it comes about despite what I felt was a good faith effort to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.263" offset="5012459">In short, the dilemma, the cruelty, the unfairness does not depend on government misconduct, and I think that government misconceives the meaning of due process when it says that an essential ingredient of a violation of due process is that there must be some affirmative misconduct on the part of the government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1290.141" offset="5263966">Now, I would agree with you sir that if she had done that, ignorant as she was, that a chain of events would have been set in sequence that might well have resulted in her becoming educated because she would then have been subjected to the contempt part of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1310.164" offset="5344005">In exerting that contempt part, the court would have appointed counsel to represent her and counsel could then have effectively informed her of her privilege, but she didn’t know she had that alternative Mr. Chief Justice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1387.662" offset="5654026">Now, if it is true that the violation is one of due process, then it seems to me clear that the testimony whether it’s exculpatory as was the case here or inculpatory that a self incriminatory must be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.577" offset="5729677">And the reason for that I think stems from cases like Lisenba versus California where the Court pointed out that the aim of the requirement of due process is not to exclude presumptively false evidence, but to prevent fundamental unfairness in the use of evidence whether true or false.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.912" offset="5831032">In short, to vindicate the violation of the due process amendment which occurred here, to correct it, to deter future instances, it is essential that whether the testimony given as the result of this dilemma, or this unfair position in which the witness is placed, be suppressed whether it exculpates or inculpates the witness.</text>
