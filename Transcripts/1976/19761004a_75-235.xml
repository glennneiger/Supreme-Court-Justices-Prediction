            <text syncTime="32.028" offset="228646">The question upon which this Court has granted certiorari was whether or not such seizures have violated the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.433" offset="262188">The petitioner in this case G. M. Leasing Corporation had all of its assets seize pursuant to such a jeopardy tax assessment and as a result, it dealt the debt now to the Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.549" offset="314642">Those assets consisted of several luxury automobiles including four Stutz automobiles, two Rolls Royces and a Jaguar.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.605" offset="354870">Additionally a bank account was seized from G.M. Leasing Corporation together with all of its books of records.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.964" offset="388307">The petitioner was a family owned corporation and was a new or start-up corporation that was incorporated for the purpose of leasing luxury automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.163" offset="429162">At the time of the seizure the petitioner had not yet engaged in the business of leasing, however, taken many pre-requisite steps in order so to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="165.892" offset="764052">There is no question that the petitioner G.M. Leasing Corporation was a family corporation and primarily controlled by an individual by the name of George I. Norman, Jr.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.590" offset="802818">Mr. Norman was a businessman in Salt Lake City, Utah and he have substantial income and substantial wealth.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.012" offset="856526">In 1970 one of the years under consideration in this case he paid estimated taxes of $290,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.306" offset="889753">Because of his income and high expenses Mr. Norman was in the state of constantly undergoing IRS Audits.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.064" offset="920787">In fact, he had undergone an audit from the years 1963-1968 and the IRS Auditor was one particular agent by the name of Bill Clayton.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.700" offset="959239">The evidence of the trial showed that an animosity had developed between Mr. Norman and Mr. Clayton.</text>

            <text syncTime="234.358" offset="1037920">Mr. Clayton was the IRS Auditor who prepared the assessments in the Hester case.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.267" offset="1057564">In March of 1973, the taxpayer George I. Norman, Jr. became a fugitive from Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.061" offset="1080761">Several years prior to his becoming a fugitive he was convicted of the federal crime of aiding and abetting a willful misapplication of bank bonds.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.449" offset="1122243">He was sentenced to two years in prison and through the course of several years, he had appealed his conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.870" offset="1147948">In March of 1973, his appeals were exhausted and he was required to surrender himself to begin serving his prison term.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.635" offset="1175011">He did surrender himself to the Marshals in Denver, Colorado, and after surrendering himself he asked permission to make a telephone call, The Marshal released him to go down the hall to a payphone and he never returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.219" offset="1225375">He left his family and his home, and incidentally he left his assets behind him.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.828" offset="1247840">Mr. Bill Clayton, the evidence showed had been working on Mr. Normanâ€™s 1970 and 1971 taxes since October prior to his fugitive status in March.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.653" offset="1295069">Several weeks after Mr. Norman became a fugitive, Mr. Clayton prepared a statutory notice of deficiency for Mr. Normanâ€™s 1970 1971 taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.003" offset="1336552">He then recommended that this assessment to be a jeopardy assessment, and he finally recommended that the petitioner G.M. Leasing Corporation be considered the alter ego nominee or transferee of George I. Norman.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.808" offset="1387752">In accordance with those recommendations, the IRS issued a jeopardy assessment and made demand upon Mrs. Norman, the taxpayerâ€™s wife for the payment of approximately $1 million dollars in taxes, penalties and interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.683" offset="1443236">Mrs. Norman who was not accustomed to her husbandâ€™s business, she was merely a housewife suggested that the IRS agents see her husbandâ€™s attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.402" offset="1478135">Rather than so doing the IRS Agentâ€™s next step was to start seizing assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.596" offset="1498824">Their first move was against the bungalow in Salt Lake City, Utah, which was known throughout the briefs in the trial as the Cottage.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.220" offset="1525365">The Cottage was the office of the petitioner, it was also the office of George I. Norman and it was also the residence of George Normanâ€™s son the intervener in this action.</text>

            <text syncTime="365.373" offset="1561936">Mr. Leedy, you are referring to Mr. Norman and petitioner as if they were two separate entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.608" offset="1582939">You take issue with Tenth Circuitâ€™s finding that one with the alter ego or the other.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard J. Leedy</label>
            <text syncTime="374.616" offset="1598926">I certainly do, I would rather adopt the trials courtâ€™s finding that they were not alter ego or nominee status.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.150" offset="1633094">The Internal Revenue Service broke the locks on the building known as the Cottage and entered and began searching.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.564" offset="1658798">Upon their entry, one of their group Chiefs realized that it was a residence as well as an office, and based upon his own testimony he said he was fearful of violating someoneâ€™s constitutional rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.620" offset="1702998">And therefore, he replaced the locks and left the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.794" offset="1723686">Two days later, the Internal Revenue Service agents again broke into the cottage and they seized the entire cottage including the real estate and including the contents of the cottage, which included the books and records of the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.424" offset="1782201">The IRS at that time also seized all of the assets of petitioner, which consisted of luxury automobile as well as the bank account, its books and records.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.599" offset="1818877">Petitioner brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Utah for wrongful levy pursuant to statute 26 United States Code Section 7426.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.495" offset="1862449">The District Court found in petitionerâ€™s favor there was not an alter ego nominee or transferee of George I. Norman, Jr. that the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.285" offset="1901633">The second aspect of the petitionerâ€™s claims in the District Court was that the assessment was arbitrary and capricious.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.847" offset="1927860">Petitioners sought an injunction against the collection of tax and the seizure of assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.717" offset="1947399">The Court may wish to note that last term we decided the Shapiro case, which I believed, had almost an identical, factual connotation as the Hester case.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.263" offset="1981567">In the Hester case, the petitioner attempted to discover the basis underlying the tax assessment, which was done in Shapiro.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.327" offset="2009780">In so doing, we took the deposition of the District Director of the Internal Revenue Service in Salt Lake City and in Shapiro case written by deposition, the taxpayer proceeded by way of written interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.147" offset="2065055">Under advice of Justice Department Council, the District Director refused to answer any questions concerning the tax assessments.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.628" offset="2090968">Two reasons were given for the refusal.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.019" offset="2100581">The first one is rather ironic because they refused to give us information about the tax assessment because we do not have the taxpayerâ€™s consent; if they had seized all of our assets to pay for the taxpayerâ€™s taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.503" offset="2154498">The second reason for refusing to answer the question was the same reason given in Shapiro, that the anti-injunction act applied and there was no jurisdiction in the District Court to restrain the collection of taxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="891.549" offset="3666674">To please the Court, at the trial we attempted to attack the assessment that had been given because the government had counterclaim for foreclosure upon the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.829" offset="3707843">We had showed that the Auditor had failed to include in his computations the fact that the taxpayer had paid $290,000, that he had included in the assessment some $115,000 in income that really was an income and that through as prior audits of the taxpayers, he knew that the taxpayer had high business expenses but yet he took no steps to find out what the business expenses were.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.423" offset="3806168">Again the Trial Court ruled in favor of the petitioner under the theory that there is a presumption of correctness as to an assessment but that the evidence that weâ€™ve brought forth had rebutted that presumption of correctness, and that shifted the burden to the government to show if there were any taxes due annoying at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.680" offset="3875236">But the governmentâ€™s evidence was in somewhat disarray, they could not lay a foundation for their exhibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="948.052" offset="3892686">They did not have necessary witnesses to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.963" offset="3904389">After several attempts, the government rested.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.825" offset="3915778">The Trial Court ruled in favor of the petitioner and the Tenth Circuit again reversed saying that we had to show more error than we had to overcome the presumption of correctness.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.620" offset="3954962">The final proposition sought by the petitioner in the Trial Court was that the seizure of its books and records, and the seizure of its assets violated its Fourth Amendment rights to the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.011" offset="4000519">That is the question upon which this Court granted certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.836" offset="4027791">Again, the Trial Court ruled in favor of the petitioner and allowed us how the damages were permissible but set a hearing date later for the determination of damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.743" offset="4079513">The Tenth Circuit again reversed that and there was a finding that the one agent had acted with malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.827" offset="4103755">The Tenth Circuit indicated that they could find no malice in the record and it held that the taxpayers had acted pursuant to statute the levy in the strange statute and that therefore there was no illegal search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.422" offset="4162165">His petitionerâ€™s position that the levy in the strange statute and the jeopardy assessments statute taken together which allows a seizure of property immediately upon an assessment without any notice to the taxpayer and without any pre-determination of probable cause is a violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1255.071" offset="5120754">To please the Court, I believe in determining whether or not a warrant is applicable to a tax payer seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.309" offset="5145727">One might look at the legislative history surrounding the adoption of the Fourth Amendment which I think clearly shows that the tax collectorâ€™s seizure of property was in the contemplation of the framers of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.747" offset="5199435">Most of that legislative history has gone into my opening brief and I would rather than repetitious, I would just simply state that I believe that the legislative history supports the proposition that the seizure of assets by a tax collector is within the meaning of the word â€˜seizureâ€™ of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.982" offset="5272369">The second question revolves around, is once you determine that the tax collectorâ€™s seizure is within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, the next question is whether or not a warrant should be required before that seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.919" offset="5312180">Or whether or not their exigent circumstances precedent, which were dispensed for the requirement of warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.448" offset="5334331">It is the petitionerâ€™s position that there are no such exigent circumstances and as the governments position that, there are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.401" offset="5362126">Government cites for support the fact that the tax payer was a fugitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1320.681" offset="5383233">The fact that he had not assisted or cooperated in the preparation of his assessment or tax returns and the final reason that certain properties had disappeared, and therefore, they felt their were exigent circumstances which justified the dispensation with the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.868" offset="5447912">I would submit the fact of the petitioner that the tax payers are fugitive, has no bearing on whether or not the collection of the taxes is in jeopardy because all of the assets were left behind that he had no control over the assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.488" offset="5498485">But even more importantly he had been a fugitive for approximately two-three weeks before the issuance of the jeopardy assessment and there would certainly be time to obtain a warrant within that period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.738" offset="5543415">The second question of whether or not he cooperated in the preparation of his taxes, I again do not have any understanding of how that bears upon whether the collection is in jeopardy or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.675" offset="5583226">But I would submit that the record is devoid of any request on the part of the IRS to obtain his cooperation that in fact the agent himself referred to go to third-party sources to obtain his information about the tax payer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1384.691" offset="5639233">The final argument, Your Honors, pertaining to this question is the disappearance of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1390.517" offset="5662534">You recall the IRS agents entered into the cottage on one particular day and then they left shortly after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.548" offset="5686671">That time they left men keeping surveillance on the cottage and they observed that evening certain boxes of material being taken by unknown persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.689" offset="5735259">Two days later or a day-and-a-half later, they then decided to make their seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.245" offset="5753440">I would submit number one, that they had already made the determination of jeopardy prior to that occurrence so that could not have been a relevant factor and number two, that within the day-and-a-half period they could have certainly have had time to obtain the detached neutral Magistrateâ€™s decision as to whether or not the man owed any taxes, whether or not those taxes were in jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.704" offset="5827314">The final argument that the petitioners use is the argument which is often stated in tax cases and that is that the government has a compelling and urgent need to collect his taxes, and therefore, there are exigent circumstances, which would do away with the requirement of obtaining the Magistrateâ€™s decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.567" offset="5898785">I would submit to the Court that while I have heard that statement made in many tax cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.456" offset="5926266">I do not know what is so urgent and compelling about the collection of this manâ€™s taxes and finally, I believe in this day and age of budget deficits and deficits spendings that, that while at once may have been an urgent need of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.956" offset="5976317">It is no longer such an urgent need, at least no more urgent than the governmentâ€™s need to obtain evidence against criminal suspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.675" offset="6007141">Therefore, in conclusion, Your Honors, we believe that the entry into the cottage for the purpose of seizing books and records was a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.940" offset="6036294">We believe that the seizure of assets is also a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment that therefore the general requirements of the Fourth Amendment should apply that a warrant be obtained and that there were no exigent circumstances in this case which would dispense with the requirement of warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1509.921" offset="6140157">I would like to return the case somewhat to the issue before which is the validity of these seizures under the Fourth Amendment of the propriety of a jeopardy assessment in this case is not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.099" offset="6192924">Indeed at trial Mr. Leedy had a witness to testify about the jeopardy assessment excluded on the grounds that he was not a contestant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.196" offset="6241303">The propriety of the jeopardy assessment he was contesting the amount of -- so I do not think we need to discuss whether the jeopardy assessment was in itself proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.857" offset="6283935">I would like to help focus consideration of the case if I discuss separately the three acts of that are complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.086" offset="6304833">First the seizure of seven luxury automobiles registered to G.M. Leasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1555.747" offset="6323432">Second, the entry upon the premises of the office bungalow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.772" offset="6339628">Third, the seizure of the records along with the other assets remaining in the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.160" offset="6361153">Considerations affecting the legality of these three acts come without a warrant varies, so I think it is best to discuss them separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.240" offset="6389469">What I want to say is background that I think it is clear from the record that the IRS had very good reason for what it did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.121" offset="6416950">As the fact show the tax payer, Mr. Norman, had filed a return for 1970 that gave no information whatever from which his correct tax can be computed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.502" offset="6462508">The check he gave in payment of his 1971 tax was dishonored by the bank and Mr. Norman never filed any return for that year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.606" offset="6494900">Now, unreasonably the Internal Revenue Service became concerned about the collection of Mr. Normanâ€™s taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1603.825" offset="6515798">Now, it began to investigate but the investigation formally opened had not moved ahead until in early March of 1973, Mr. Norman became a fugitive from justice after being convicted for misapplication of bank funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.988" offset="6580477">That caused the service appear they would never recover any of the taxes owed by Mr. Norman and they moved rapidly ahead with their audit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.255" offset="6609525">Now, our brief states and I do not want to correct any wrong implication if there is one that they have received no cooperation from Mr. Norman.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.011" offset="6640558">It is quite correct that Mr. Norman was a fugitive from justice and nobody had asked him prior to that time for cooperation after he became a fugitive from justice, they went to third-party sources to develop their information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.988" offset="6700431">But the services sense of urgency was no doubt increased by the fact that it is Agent Applegate testified in the Appendix of page 85.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.784" offset="6739615">He said that there had been in this case missing stocks and bonds, shuffling of records, a bank account cleaned out, safety deposit boxes cleaned out, and cars stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.956" offset="6784336">So that they were quite concerned about preserving the assets they could still find.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.811" offset="8087742">There was a later increase in the income for one of these years but that information, that is increase in the assessment, the deficiency, that information did not come from these books or records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.593" offset="8126821">The IRS went in to gather assets, there were books and records, they took them for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.062" offset="8152735">One reason was they thought that the records might themselves contain assets such as stock certificates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.155" offset="8181156">The other is they thought the records might indicate the location of other property of the taxpayer, and that is not an investigatory reason such as you would have in a criminal case that is simply means of tracking down property, and all of this is taken in that kind of a seizure of records.</text>

            <text syncTime="2066.268" offset="8365580">Well, they made the first entry into the bungalow office on the 21st of March.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.393" offset="8386060">They backed out when they saw a stove, a refrigerator because they thought it might be a private residence but it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.465" offset="8418348">That night, they saw people carrying boxes of things out of the building, and in the morning, they discovered that the Stutz automobile, which had been in the garage, which they had not seized disappeared, they later recovered that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.206" offset="8477280">It turned out that it was removed by the younger Norman and they later recovered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.344" offset="8505910">But I suppose the automobiles in this case are the most important issues in the Internal Revenue Service, because it seizes assets of that type everyday and it is very important in the collection of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2116.530" offset="8566619">And I think it would probably impractical, given the dispersion of property that taxpayers mostly have to impose a warrant requirement on that kind of seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2128.126" offset="8613012">For one thing, the Fourth Amendment requires that the places and so forth be described with particularity which means that you have to search for the property then post a guard then go back and get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.830" offset="8659824">And you have multiple applications in many cases as they kept locating new property, which would also thrust the courts I must say into the day-to-day administration of the Internal Revenues Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.523" offset="8714576">Now, the core value of the Fourth Amendment, I take it to be the protection of privacy and it seems to me that that value is not even implicated in the process of levying upon automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.250" offset="8765463">The petitioner here makes no point that there was any entry upon any private premises to seize the automobiles and indeed they were found on parking lots and public garages, and I think one of them was found on the streets though, I am not entirely sure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.899" offset="8816036">But there is no privacy interest, the only thing that is at stake here is a seizure for a property interest and the United States has a property interest superior to that of George Norman or his alter ego, the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.707" offset="8871311">And that is shown I think by the fact that anything that was seized, which ultimately be held and have been improperly seized, is fully compensable by damages, which an invasion of a privacy interest never is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.105" offset="8936931">And I should note that a full deficiency notice listing issue the items, deficiency has been served upon the taxpayer and that Mr. Norman is now on the Tax Court with his attorney contesting the amount of the deficiency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.524" offset="9014566">I think that is sufficient, it think the automobiles seizure covered by Murrayâ€™s Lessee case which we discussed in our brief and I think it is sufficient to dispose of that issue in favor of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.695" offset="9059288">It is only a property interest at stake, and I think the interest of the Unites States and the flexibility in collecting its efficiency, in collecting amounts due it by delinquent taxpayers fully justifies that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3432.770" offset="13831546">There is one issue I would like to take with the Solicitor General that appeared in the brief and also appears in the argument here and that is that the seizure of the assets is not a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment and not entitled as Protection because in essence they are seizing a property interest and there is therefore no violation of a privacy interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.906" offset="13920153">I would take issue of that as I understand the right to privacy, the right to be at let alone from government interference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.257" offset="13945544">I would think it is particularly acute when in fact a premise is entered into, but also when the property is seized and one is dispossessed as the ownership of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.079" offset="13992774">I think that that is just as much a violation of a privacy interest as it is a property interest and I would cite this Court to itâ€™s case in 1-1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania, which is 380 U.S. 693 which is a forfeiture proceeding against an automobile where in this Court held that the Fourth Amendment applied when seeking to deprive an owner of the ownership of this property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.711" offset="14103324">Consequently, I believe it is superficial to say that all we are doing is dispossessing a person of a property interest, therefore, no privacy interest is affected and therefore the Fourth Amendment does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.045" offset="14148673">I believe that privacy interests are affected when a personâ€™s property is taken away from you.</text>
