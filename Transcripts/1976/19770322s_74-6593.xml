            <text syncTime="18.952" offset="176287">In Gardner against Florida, the petitioner was convicted of first-degree murder in the Circuit Court of Citrus County Florida and sentenced to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.503" offset="214530">When the trial judge imposed the death sentence, he stated that he was relying in part on information in a presentence investigation report.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.065" offset="248699">Portions of the report were not disclosed to counsel for the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.304" offset="265730">Without reviewing the confidential portion of the presentence report, the Supreme Court of Florida, over the dissent of two justices, affirmed the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.097" offset="304914">In an opinion which I have delivered to the clerk, which is joined by Mr. Justice Stewart and Mr. Justice Powell, we conclude that this procedure does not satisfy the constitutional command that no person shall be deprived of life without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.754" offset="367503">The Chief Justice while not joining our opinion, concurs in the judgment, vacating the death sentence and remanding the case to the Florida Supreme Court with directions to order further proceedings at the trial court level.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.028" offset="420584">Mr. Justice Brennan has filed a separate opinion agreeing with the reasoning in our opinion, but stating that he would simply vacate the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.289" offset="453603">Mr. Justice White has filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.429" offset="470217">Mr. Justice Blackmun has also filed an opinion concurring in the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.022" offset="488607">Mr. Justice Marshall has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.996" offset="500414">Mr. Justice Rehnquist has also filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
