            <text syncTime="23.660" offset="195103">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.585" offset="206806">This case is here on a petition for Writ of Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which rejected a claim by Kentucky prisoners that the State Parole Board be required to abide by the minimum guarantee of procedural due process in determining whether or not to release prisoners on parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.648" offset="283084">Specifically the issue is two fold.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.307" offset="293742">First, whether the decision to grant or deny parole implicates an interest in liberty, protected by the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and secondly, if the parole function is accorded to constitutional protection, what are the minimum safeguards that apply?</text>
            <text syncTime="65.101" offset="360929">Before addressing these questions, I will discuss briefly, the threshold question of mootness, whose consideration has been deferred until this hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.664" offset="403142">The State has suggested that the release on parole of the name petitioner has mooted this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.118" offset="428951">It is our position that this occurrence has not deprived this action of the necessary adversariness or by present vitality under Article 3.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.206" offset="473360">Three grounds support our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.261" offset="481510">First, we believe that this is a case capable of repetition between the parties, yet awaiting the plenary review of this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.402" offset="1134049">Finally, under the intention of Rule 23, there are a number of lower Court cases supporting the proposition that the justice ability of the case is not affected when the name petitioner or the name plaintiff is mooted or the situation of the name plaintiff is mooted.</text>

            <text syncTime="425.934" offset="1804246">Turning to the merits, the initial inquiry as established by the cases is into the nature of the interest at stake in the parole decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.924" offset="1840191">An understanding of the paroling process will show that this interest has ample substance to be embraced within the concept of liberty, protected by the Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.060" offset="1884703">Parole is a statutory creation of the State and is an integral part of the sentencing apparatus of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.408" offset="1914169">When an individual is sentenced, it is contemplated by the legislature, by the sentencing judge, by prison administrators and by the parole board that most prisoners will spend part of their time in incarceration and part of their on the streets on parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.693" offset="1979267">Among the critical decisions made about an individual involved in the criminal justice system, the parole decision is one of the most important.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.983" offset="2012390">From arrest to conviction to sentencing to imprison deprivations, to parole revocation, one of the major concerns of the system is the length of incarceration that an individual will serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.053" offset="2056693">This concern is magnified in the parole decision, which unlike the other decisions, points that I have mentioned is not according constitutional protection or due process protection of any kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.464" offset="2102356">This conception of parole as an integral part of the system of government decision making, determining the length of incarceration of an individual is often obscured by another notion of parole as simply another form of correctional treatment that is left to the unbridle discretion of experts who primarily are involved in predicting recidivism.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.443" offset="2186261">However, common this conception was in days when parole was considered charity or a gift or a grace, it has not and cannot withstand present day scrutiny.</text>

            <text syncTime="541.246" offset="2265464">If the state abandons a parole system and modifies its sentencing system which it would have to do, this case would not be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.384" offset="2306006">This case does not involve the constitutional right to parole, and only fair consideration in the process of determining parole.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.276" offset="2337562">Today, it is commonly accepted that the parole decision is based on a variety of factors unrelated to the predictive ability of the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.586" offset="2370790">Some of these considerations are the past history of an individual, the offense the individual committed, the person’s institutional record, the prison population capacities in a particular state and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.644" offset="2423035">To the extent that these factors enter the parole decision which they most certainly do, the absolute claim of expertise suggested by the State on behalf of the Board carries less force.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.778" offset="2471622">Our opponents probably would concede that a variety of factors enter into the decision making process of the Board, but they claim that the board has unfettered discretion to weigh these factors in any fashion that they will.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.494" offset="2526480">I think a look at the Kentucky system will reveal that the Board’s discretion is not as uncaving as the State suggests.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.680" offset="2559185">Kentucky has created a scheme of conditional release, where prisoners spend part of their time in prison and part of their time outside on conditional release.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.564" offset="2602757">The system is administered by a Board composed of professional decision makers, who make upwards of 1000 decisions per year.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.330" offset="2637761">Although this Board is within the State Department of Corrections and relies on the State Department of Corrections for information, it is a statutory creature of its own within the sentencing apparatus and contemplated to be within the sentencing apparatus of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="648.726" offset="2695440">By statue, the board is required to abide by certain ground rules which evidence the legislature’s concern, the Kentucky Legislature’s concern with fair and complete consideration in the parole process.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.497" offset="2746431">The Board is required, mandated by statute to amass a good deal of information on an individual and it is allowed to call on the resources of the Department of Corrections, the State police and others to gather this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.082" offset="2804840">Secondly, the Board is required by statute to study the case history or the record of the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.247" offset="2829500">Thirdly, the board is required to deliberate on that record and fourth, to conduct a hearing which it does, often lasting five to ten minutes at the most and fifth, because the Board is composed of five members, it is also required to engage in some, sort of, collegial decision making, it is not one individual.</text>

            <text syncTime="3154.489" offset="12718414">Just a few points Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.166" offset="12725102">I believe that General Kimberlin stated our case when he noted in response to questions about Goldsmith that an individual or if an individual becomes a member of the class then he or she is entitled to due process protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.040" offset="12800648">I think that is precisely the nature of the process of parole release.</text>
            <text syncTime="3180.313" offset="12821755">The Board, exercising discretion, uses the criteria that it has developed over the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.061" offset="12848713">It reviews the files as the statistics to know a large number of individuals meet those criteria and in fact are paroled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.471" offset="12882359">This is much closer to the sentencing analogy that Mr. Justice Stevens noted and to the type of discretion that was exercised in Morrissey versus Brewer and the type of process that existed in Morrissey versus Brewer and for instance in Meachum versus Fano.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.572" offset="12962816">Parole release is part of this continuum in the criminal justice process, involving the important interest of release on parole as opposed to whatever interest an individual would have which is not constitutionally protected under Meachum versus Fano.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.410" offset="13034078">Finally, I think that the reading of depravation under the Due Process Clause to exclude this case would be an overly formalistic reading under this Court’s case is in Goldsmith and Schware and Wilner and alster term in Hampton and for these reasons we believe that the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit should be reversed and the case remanded for an evidentiary hearing and further proceedings.</text>
