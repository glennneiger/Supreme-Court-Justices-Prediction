            <text syncTime="92.423" offset="473109">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.554" offset="493589">I represent the company in a consolidated case which involves also petitioner, International Brotherhood of Teamsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.428" offset="533086">I wanted to make a preliminary comment.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.400" offset="544998">We have not filed a reply brief in this matter because of the press of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.882" offset="570911">Without intending any criticism, we received the brief of the Government on December 21 and its original due date had been September 10, I believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.359" offset="628799">If the Court believes that it is desirable, we will submit a reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.158" offset="655966">This involves a claim against a nationwide trucking company that has terminals, that has 51 terminals throughout the country and it is a claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that T.I.M.E.-D.C. and its predecessors have been guilty of discrimination in the assignment of minorities to lower paying jobs than non-minority employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.922" offset="767039">Discrimination by refusing transfer and maintaining a seniority system under contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters that perpetuates the effect of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.198" offset="812178">The Teamsters were also charged with being parties to a contract that locks in the effects of prior discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.630" offset="849899">This suit was filed in early 1971 and as the amicus brief on behalf of the NAACP group indicates, three Justice Department Attorneys spent a year-and-a-half developing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.212" offset="916250">They were aided by the Post Office in obtaining copies of compliance reports by T.I.M.E.-D.C..</text>
            <text syncTime="211.620" offset="949896">They received aid from the EEOC in the form of complaints that had been filed with the EEOC and they received aid from the FBI in copying over a thousand documents in the possession of T.I.M.E.-D.C. whose files were willingly opened for the examination by the FBI and the Justice Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.128" offset="1051878">We are also told in that amicus brief that they were 60 depositions, 150 witnesses in addition to the deponents were interviewed by the Justice Department, Attorneys and that the Justice Department itself copied over a thousand documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.205" offset="1112168">I mention this only to point out that this case received the full benefit of the plaintiff, the Justice Department in presenting evidence as to a pattern or practice of discrimination and in presenting evidence not only as to liability, but also as to remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.778" offset="1206523">Then at the trial there was a consent decree that took care of the issues of back pay which we think is a very significant feature and in regard to that virtually all of the persons who were entitled to back pay accepted the back pay and signed releases.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.266" offset="1296488">The other issue taken care of by the consent decree was the issue of future hiring and the company agreed to hire minorities for all of its job classifications at all terminals on a one-to-one ratio with non minorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.340" offset="1360750">The Consent Decree is specifically left open whether there was in fact discrimination by the company and the identification of discriminatees if any, who were suffering presently from the past effects of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.593" offset="1437759">At the trial the Justice Department submitted a list in response to the request of the District Court of non -- of the discriminitees for whom specific relief was sought and immediately following the trial, the District Court also asked the Justice Department for a list of all of the discriminitees, including class discriminitees for whom relief was sought and such a list was submitted in June of 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.304" offset="1584567">It is significant to note that, that list which is shown in the Appendix has the names of each of the individuals who are in the alleged class of the City employees at those terminals were T.I.M.E.-D.C. has road operations.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.961" offset="1655202">And beside each of their name there is an indication that the relief sought in virtually all cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.394" offset="1684982">The relief sought is a transfer to road possession with seniority for competitive status as of the date, the person originally became an employee of the company.</text>

            <text syncTime="493.895" offset="2078908">The District Court conducted a trial on all issues of liability and remedy and ordered relief in the way of finding the company guilty of discrimination based upon statistical evidence in the testimony of those who did testify at the trial plus deposition testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.758" offset="2182353">The District Court then awarded relief in the remedy stage which was combined with the liability stage to three categories, on Appendixes A, B and C.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.592" offset="2253720">The first two consisting of individuals who had testified or had been deposed who were given awards of senior -- the right to transfer and awards of seniority as of the effective date of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.536" offset="2337520">The third category, the so called Appendix C authorized the transfer of all minority City employees to road vacancies based upon taking competitive status seniority with them as of the date they entered the particular road vacancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.888" offset="2426964">On appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals completely dismantled the decree of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.153" offset="2471999">The Circuit Court first of all viewed the proceedings below as being a bifurcated trial and replete in the Circuit Court decision are references to the liability stage of the trial and that proof should have been saved to the remedy stage of the trial, as if, there were going to be another trial contemplated by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.675" offset="2598118">This is definitely not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.886" offset="2606895">Everything that was done in that District Court proceeding was in the nature of proving or disproving liability as well as remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.587" offset="2641690">The Circuit Court of Appeals then set aside the Appendix A, B and C lists and the relative awards of seniority and indicated inline with previous decisions that all the city employees who were on the Appendix C list were to be and the other list as well to work -- to be considered and to be given full competitive seniority upon transfer to the road.</text>

            <text syncTime="1015.479" offset="4165256">Mr. Chief Justice, if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.991" offset="4179362">The Teamsters Union has been found to have violated the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by only the entering into and enforcement of the collective bargaining contract which provided seniority rights to employees represented by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.588" offset="4297749">There is no other evidence or nor is there any other contention as to any unlawful act by the Teamsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.870" offset="4334843">I want to address myself to two matters in this oral argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.383" offset="4352920">One, is there a violation insofar as Teamsters are concerned of Section 703 (c) which is the provision of the statute which defines a union unlawful activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.109" offset="4411852">We say there’s not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.556" offset="4417599">Then, I want to address myself to the question of proper remedy if the employer has indeed violation -- violate the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.809" offset="4450617">I want to put it in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.043" offset="4463574">Unions do not hire people, employers do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.685" offset="4482069">That Federal Law for some time has restricted unions with respect the hiring hauls, etc.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.697" offset="4514147">Most of T.I.M.E.-D.C.’s operations are in right to work state where there is just flat prohibition against union doing anything and with respect to hiring or allocation of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.677" offset="4562108">So the sole responsibility with respect to hiring and allocation is the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.431" offset="4589066">Now, who is this employer?</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.823" offset="4598680">He has 1800 road drivers over the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.808" offset="4614562">He has 2600 city people; dockmen, hustlers, city drivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.906" offset="4663045">He has 400 of those 2600 are either blacks or Spanish speaking Americans, I call them browns as in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.386" offset="4716962">The 400 -- well, now let me backup just a moment as to what was done below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.191" offset="4752175">There was evidence by way of statistics that showed horrible statistics.</text>

            <text syncTime="3898.993" offset="15699362">In perpetuating this discrimination, that is correct, that is the holding and that is I say has been the uniform holding of eight Courts of Appeals since Quarles decision nine years ago and I want to go very briefly through this chronology for the Court because the union in this case is saying that the Quarles line of decision should be distinguished as not involving a bona fide seniority system, is involving seniority systems that were used only for the purposes of discrimination and then they refer in their reply brief to a brief filed this weekend by the AFL CIO, not in this case, but in United Air Lines against Evans.</text>
            <text syncTime="3949.728" offset="15902281">The brief that has not been distributed yet which asks this Court to repudiate the whole Quarles line of cases on the premise that if the Court can’t find that they’re distinguishable from the kind of case we have involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3968.486" offset="15977305">But the first point is in Quarles and in many of the subsequent cases, the courts recognized that the job seniority or departmental seniority systems served legitimate purposes were not adopted solely for the purpose of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3987.263" offset="16052433">And I want to just very quickly, in Quarles itself refer the Court to 279 F. Supplement, pages 513 and 519, in which those findings were specified in Quarles itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="4002.098" offset="16111783">Nonetheless, the Court held that despite its legitimate aspects because it also had this function of perpetuating discrimination, it could not be applied so as to accomplish that result, but the Court was very careful in Quarles not to set aside the departmental seniority system in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="4024.468" offset="16201226">It preserved the system insofar as it could be applied without having this effect of perpetuating discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="4061.321" offset="16348662">There are several points that were made here partly quoting the Quarles decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="4067.681" offset="16374053">First, it was pointed out that the references in the legislative history, the preservation of seniority systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="4076.430" offset="16409057">This was all before the 1972 Amendment, were to employment seniority in general and none of the excerpts in that history referred specifically to departmental seniority or something that was to be preserved and the proviso to Section 703 (h) expressly states that the seniority system must be bona fide and the rationale of these cases is that to the extent that application of the system perpetuates discriminatory effects on individuals who were discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="4120.604" offset="16585749">To that extent, the application is not bona fide within the meaning of this.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="4130.984" offset="16627336">That too was addressed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.439" offset="16641128">There was a specific portion of the case devoted to the contention that it was not adopted with the intent to discriminate, that is roman numeral V of the opinion, beginning on page 995 in 416 F.2d.</text>
            <text syncTime="4152.990" offset="16715316">They found unpersuasive, the argument, that whatever its operational effects, job seniority is immune under the statute because not imposed with the intent to discriminate and that was largely on the basis of the kind of rationale later used by this Court in Griggs against Duke Power in talking about facially neutral or even neutral intent criteria that nonetheless have a discriminatory effect as being part of what the act prohibits.</text>
            <text syncTime="4183.196" offset="16836106">There are two things that the Court pointed out here.</text>
            <text syncTime="4186.264" offset="16848436">One is that every time a Negro worker hired under the old segregated system bids against a white worker in his job slot, the old ratio classification reasserts itself and the Negro suffers anew for his employer’s previous bias and the other point is quoting the Quarles decision, the Court of Appeals pointed out that the act does not condone present differences that are the result of intention to discriminate before the effective date of the act and the result doesn’t mean that the seniority system itself had to be intended to discriminate and although such a provision could've been included in the Act if Congress so intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="4231.431" offset="17029099">Now, later in 1968, the Seventh Circuit adopted the same rationale, the same holding, the same seniority carryover, in Bowe against Colgate, Palmolive.</text>
            <text syncTime="4244.397" offset="17080926">In all of these cases involved carryover of pre-act seniority, including all the ones I’m about to talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="4252.723" offset="17114258">Then a petition for certiorari was filed in Local 189 of the United Paperworkers case in which this was the principal issue raised and I looked at our brief in opposition that we filed at that time, I mean January 1970, and we did not deny the importance of the issue, instead we were able to point out that there were now three Court of Appeals decisions unanimously holding this because the one contrary, District Court opinion, which had been rendered in North Carolina, in Griggs against Duke Power Company, had been reversed by Judge Borman’s opinion for the Fourth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="4298.445" offset="17297115">This was all before Griggs came to this Court in another issue and we argued that those decisions were clearly correct in their interpretation of Title VII as applying in this manner and this Court denied certiorari in volumes 397 of the U.S. reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="4318.995" offset="17379349">The following term, Griggs came up on the testing issue, the other issue it didn’t even come to this Court on this issue and was later decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="4330.153" offset="17423966">Then in the course of the 1972 reenactment, the legislative history of which is recounted in some detail, in this Court’s opinion, in Franks against Bowman Transportation Company, these cases were referred to in both the Senate Committee Report and the House Committee Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="4354.986" offset="17523336">And the principle that they embodied was described in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="4360.113" offset="17543816">I now turn to a lengthy footnote on pages 764 and 765 of this Court’s opinion in Franks, 424 U.S.</text>
            <text syncTime="4370.827" offset="17586657">The principle that they embodied was stated in some detail as follows; first, there was a quote from the Senate Committee Report stating that employment discrimination as viewed today as a complex and pervasive phenomenon, experts familiar with the subject now generally describe the problem in terms of systems and effects rather than simple intentional wrongs and the literature on the subject is replete with discussions, for example, the mechanics of seniority and lines of progression, perpetuation of the present defect of pre-act discriminatory practices through various institutional devices and testing invalidation requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="4421.033" offset="17787486">Now, the literature is replete with that, we cited some of that literature in our brief, three prominent law review articles on the subject are cited in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="4434.125" offset="17839835">I won’t bother with the reference to them now.</text>
            <text syncTime="4436.530" offset="17849448">One of them was the 1967 note in the Harvard Law Review which is the seminal one on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="4444.192" offset="17880168">Then the rightful place principle was articulated in the conference report, it's true that this first excerpt from the Senate Committee Report, a company that build was changed with respect to the changes being made in the enforcement mechanisms for Title VII but the substantive provisions of Title VII were not changed from the way they were reported out at that time in any significant respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="4473.508" offset="17997406">The basic thrust of the legislative history of the 1972 reenactment is that Congress was satisfied with the substantive standards being applied under Title VII, but fell a need to enforce the remedies and the difference was whether that should be through cease and desist power or enabling the EEOC to sue in Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="4686.345" offset="18848789">What I need to say on the rest of this is that the rightful place principle then recognized in this legislative history had its origins not in the context in which this Court approved it in Franks against Bowman Transportation but in this context, it was always recognized in these early cases and throughout the history of litigation under this Act as a principle to be applied in carrying over seniority of incumbent employees when they transfer in and the difficult question in all of the literature and all of the cases was whether it could also be applied in the context of Franks against Bowman, whether you could have what was referred to in Local 189 itself as fictional seniority for someone who didn’t ever work for the company, whether that would be consistent with the legislative history of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="4742.803" offset="19074591">It was always agreed in all of these cases and in literature that the seniority actually earned in a company could be carry over and that was the origin of the rightful place doctrine, that language was first used in that way in the note in 1967, Harvard Law Review and by the Fifth Circuit in Local 189 and when Congress said in 1972, in any area, this was a company -- the conference report, in any area where the new law does not address itself or in areas where a specific contrary intention is not indicated, it was assumed that the present case law is developed by the courts would continue to govern the applicability in construction of Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="4790.257" offset="19264449">It’s hard to know what they possibly could have been referring to other than this line of cases which was the most prominent line of appellate cases at that time and was discussed in the three leading articles on the subject at that time were cited through this.</text>

            <text syncTime="4823.254" offset="19396420">First, evidence that the union itself had been rationally motivated, discriminatorily motivated, and secondly that the system was one that held people in inferior subordinate jobs and interfered with promotion unlike this case where these are parallel jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="4842.819" offset="19474683">Some people just like people who grew in Liverpool, half a century ago, some of them want to go to sea and some of them didn’t.</text>

            <text syncTime="5276.702" offset="21210154">Well, I bring up the Memphis experience simply to say that it is not safe to assume that city drivers make good road drivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5285.371" offset="21244844">And in Memphis, both white and minority city drivers were transferred to the road and both the white and the minority city drivers were not good road drivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="5295.419" offset="21285073">They had percentage wise a far higher accident ratio than white and minority road drivers who came in with prior road training.</text>
            <text syncTime="5306.479" offset="21329272">So I am simply commenting on an assumption that we think is not valid here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5312.409" offset="21352991">In addition, there was a statement that a minority could not transfer from the city to the road even if he wanted to give up his competitive status seniority, that is not so.</text>
            <text syncTime="5328.271" offset="21416417">At anytime, a minority or a non minority employee in the city can, if he wants to, transfer from the city to the road for competitive seniority status, he will have to go to the bottom of the road board.</text>
            <text syncTime="5344.455" offset="21481200">He keeps his benefit seniority when he goes to the road but it is not true to say that there is a no transfer policy, I believe it has been pointed out here that TIME. DC. is maybe one of the few of the larger trucking companies that does not have no transfer policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="5364.393" offset="21560926">And the record shows uniformly that with one or two exceptions, transfers were allowed from city to road.</text>
            <text syncTime="5371.222" offset="21588302">The Government also assumes that fewer than half of the people involved here will transfer.</text>

            <text syncTime="5387.041" offset="21651519">This should have been put in at the trial and we believe the Justice Department attempted to put in as much evidence as it could as to who the people were that had suffered discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="5481.284" offset="22028518">We believe that the Government has not addressed several critical issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="5487.599" offset="22053804">We have argued that we believe McDonnell Douglas should apply in determining liability and remedy and the scope of those proofs in individual class and pattern or practice cases and there has been nothing suggested in the brief of the Government or in the oral argument today why McDonnell Douglas should not so apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="5515.262" offset="22164459">As I mentioned before, there has been nothing stated here in response to our statement that all the proofs were put in for liability and remedy at the trial stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="5527.566" offset="22213674">There has been no response by the Government to our argument that the discretion granted to a District Court in matters like this has to be very broad to exercise proper equitable discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="5544.876" offset="22282846">Franks and the Forton case tell us that.</text>
            <text syncTime="5548.712" offset="22298206">We believe in the circumstances that it was a reasonable decision by the District Court, even if we assume there was discrimination to award the relief that the District Court did for categories A, B and C particularly in light of the fact that there was a partial consent decree that not only settled back pay awards for this same class but also affirmatively offered future hiring on what is a very substantial ratio, a one to one basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="5582.996" offset="22435401">Also the Government has not addressed the conflict between the circuits as to qualification date and what that means and we believe that the failure to address these things should result at the very least, in affirmation of the order of the District Court or a finding that the company is not guilty of discrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="5610.743" offset="22546369">Mr. Chief Justice and if the Court please.</text>
            <text syncTime="5615.611" offset="22565804">Counsel has addressed himself to a Quarles line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="5620.195" offset="22584195">Quarles holds 279 F. Supp 517, a department seniority system that has its genesis in racial discrimination is not a bona fide seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5632.324" offset="22632678">This system does not have its genesis there.</text>
            <text syncTime="5635.177" offset="22644067">The whole Quarles line is based on findings of union connivance with an employer or with separate black and white unions or with the line of progression seniorities, none of which apply here.</text>
            <text syncTime="5650.892" offset="22706970">Now, Mr. Justice Stevens inquired as to what the Court of Appeals had done, I’m at page six of the appendix to the petition for certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="5666.809" offset="22770604">Just a moment, I am at wrong page.</text>
            <text syncTime="5674.175" offset="22800071">I’m at page 34 of that document.</text>
            <text syncTime="5678.032" offset="22815535">All those on app. A, app. B and app. C, that is the entire list of minorities, are entitled to be given an opportunity to bid on future vacancies in the specified job classifications to which they are allowed to transfer by the District Court’s order on the basis of their seniority and if they qualify for those jobs to be permitted to exercise their full seniority in such jobs for all purposes, including bidding and layoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="5704.259" offset="22920443">Now I’m happy to hear a counsel abandon that position today and tell us if when we get back downstairs and retry that which we’ve already tried, that he’s going to let us try other issues. But he is not the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="5717.507" offset="22973419">This is what the Court of Appeals did.</text>
            <text syncTime="5720.848" offset="22986794">One other matter ought to be indicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="5723.251" offset="22996407">That is that our contract does not prohibit an employee from transferring, I’m now on page seven of that same document and this is the Court of Appeals, the second paragraph on page 7, nothing in the union contracts prohibits an employee from transferring between separate bargaining units at a given terminal but he loses his pre-transfer accumulated seniority for bid and layoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="5748.821" offset="23098702">Now if I understood what Mr. Wallace had to say, it was that the distinguishing feature between white and black city drivers is that black could not transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5763.210" offset="23156172">If that’s right, it’s this man, it’s the employer that says I cannot transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5769.084" offset="23179682">We don’t stop them from transfer.</text>
            <text syncTime="5772.524" offset="23193475">That shows that it is the discrimination in transfer by the employer that perpetuates their own, not the seniority system.</text>
            <text syncTime="5783.159" offset="23236002">Any black that is discriminated against, with respect to that transfer or refusal of transfer by the employer, has his right under the statute to -- and under your Frank's decision to be made whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="5798.013" offset="23295457">Actually he has more than that, he has a contract right under Article 38 of the contract if he wants to follow that.</text>
