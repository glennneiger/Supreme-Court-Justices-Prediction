            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100555">We will hear arguments first this morning in No. 75-1771, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Standard Life &amp; Accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.414" offset="158129">Mr. Smith, you may proceed.</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="17.621" offset="170981">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="21.310" offset="185714">This federal income-tax case comes here on a writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.220" offset="213404">It presents a question of major fiscal importance involving the taxation of practically every life-insurance company.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.393" offset="250080">The tax statute that we will be dealing with this morning imposes a unique preferential system of taxation on life-insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.083" offset="288846">It recognizes that life-insurance companies are required to add amounts of both premium income and investment income to an account called policyholder reserves in order to be able to have enough sufficient funds to meet future claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.634" offset="359063">What the statute does in brief is to permit a deduction from premium income for additions to reserves and to provide a computation by which investment income is broken down into two segments; that is, the portion of investment income and at the policyholder reserves is excluded from the tax base, and the portion of investment income which is allocable to the company’s surplus is subject to current tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.274" offset="473584">Now, the case involves a particular kind of premium called deferred and uncollected premiums, which I will shortly define.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.315" offset="509737">But suffice it to say at the outset that until the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case, four circuits, the Fourth, Fifth, Seventh and Sixth, and the Tax Court had upheld the Commissioner’s position that such premiums -- that is, deferred and uncollected premiums -- had to be consistently taken into account in computing three statutory categories: assets, premium income, although the statute refers to it as gross amount of premiums, and reserves.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.636" offset="639095">Here the Tenth Circuit has reached what we believe is an extraordinary and surprising result.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.991" offset="664486">It has held that these deferred and uncollected premiums are to be included in reserves, but nevertheless excluded from the corresponding tax computations of assets and premium income.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.122" offset="712970">We believe the decision is unprecedented, and its unprecedented and peculiar quality is underscored by the fact that, as the briefs disclose and the arguments this morning will doubtless confirm, the life-insurance industry itself has disavowed the approach taken by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.664" offset="787157">Now, before I describe the facts of the case, I think it will be helpful and it will put the issues in proper focus if I set forth for the Court three elements before moving on.</text>

            <text syncTime="218.801" offset="975657">I think the state law, the Oklahoma law involved in this case, is typical of the computational reserve modes imposed by most states.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="229.614" offset="1018916">I think it is typical, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.358" offset="1029887">Now, I would like to set out three elements for the Court before describing the facts and the holdings of the lower courts, and there I would like just to define deferred and uncollected premiums; I would then like to describe the nature of a life-insurance reserve, which is the central component of the tax computation, and the relationship of that reserve to premiums; and then I would like to describe in detail the mechanics of this tax statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.970" offset="1132392">Deferred and uncollected premiums are a particular kind of premiums used in selling life insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.910" offset="1168127">Now, a policyholder has the option to pay his premium in full as of the anniversary date, or he can pay it in installments.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.895" offset="1204072">If he pays it in installments, which are typically monthly, quarterly or semi-annually, the amount which is due to be paid after the close of the calendar year -- because insurance companies by statute are required to report their income on a calendar year -- the amount which will come in after the calendar year, but before the next anniversary date, are called deferred premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.332" offset="1317861">Now, there is another kind of premium here called uncollected premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.730" offset="1343461">Those premiums are amounts which the policyholder owes right now, but for one reason or another has not paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.774" offset="1375644">They are called premiums due and payable, or they are also known as uncollected premiums.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.441" offset="1466237">But what I am speaking of essentially is sort of two types of premiums, those which your quarterly payment is not due yet -- that is a deferred premium -- and then if the date passes when it should have been paid and is not paid, that is known as an uncollected premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.019" offset="1524542">And these two types are known in the aggregate as deferred and uncollected premiums.</text>

            <text syncTime="364.769" offset="1559546">If the premium has been uncollected for, say, 45 days -- there is a normal 30-day period in which you can pay -- is it still classed as an uncollected premium, or are we only talking about on the year-end business those that were due as of --</text>

            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="377.055" offset="1608761">I think we are only talking about the --</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_paul_stevens" startTime="378.290" stopTime="378.932">
            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="378.290" offset="1613672">Just one month.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="378.932" stopTime="514.889">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="378.932" offset="1616179">Right, because I think after the grace period, which I will describe, I think it would no longer be an uncollected premium; I think the policy would lapse, and other mechanics would take over.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.675" offset="1659229">Now, the question presented in this case involves the proper tax treatment under the current statute, which came in in 1959, for these deferred and uncollected premiums under the two principle computations under the statute: the computation for premium income, which is colloquially referred to as phase two, and the computation of taxable investment income, which is commonly referred to as phase one.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.678" offset="1763197">Let me now turn if I can to the nature of a life-insurance reserve and its relationship to premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.592" offset="1798828">The business of life insurance, I think as we all know, is essentially the shifting of the risk of death from the insured to the insurer for a price, and that price, that consideration, is called the premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.725" offset="1859432">The amount of the premium is calculated on a particular assumption, and that assumption is that the insurance company will set aside certain portions of its premiums that are received and it will invest those premiums, and those premiums will earn interest and the whole accumulated fund will be sufficient to meet claims of policyholders as they die.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.405" offset="1958175">Now, the gross premium is the amount that the policyholder actually pays, and that is divided in turn into two subordinate elements: the net valuation premium and another element called loading.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.015" offset="2016584">Now, the net valuation premium is the amount computed under particular mortality and interest-rate assumptions that the company assumes that it must take into account in order that these funds will accumulate at a particular interest rate and that it will have a sufficient amount to pay claims as they arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.982" offset="2108431">So the net valuation portion of any particular premium is the amount that the company has to set aside and invest in order to meet these future claims.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="514.889" stopTime="518.432">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="514.889" offset="2160049">Now, does that depend on state law, Mr. Smith?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="518.432" stopTime="543.049">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="518.432" offset="2174259">Well, the state law sets up, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, certain minimum reserve valuation standards in order to make sure that insurance companies will be able to pay off their claims and states might impose certain assumptions or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.103" offset="2256911">So to that extent, it does depend on state law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="543.049" stopTime="546.466">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="543.049" offset="2272689">Do most states impose minimum requirements to those?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="stuart_a_smith" startTime="546.466" stopTime="1036.212">
            <label>Mr. Stuart A. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="546.466" offset="2286377">Yes, because the states have an interest in making sure that when people pay premiums over a lifetime that they are not going to be faced with an insolvent insurance company which won't be able to pay off on the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.454" offset="2330367">Now, the reserve, the life-insurance reserve, is this amount that the company must set aside to meet its future claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.212" offset="2361401">So the reserve is defined universally by the life-insurance texts as the sum of these net valuation premiums taken in year by year, plus the interest at the assumed rate minus the death claims that are going to be paid out, and that at any given point in time is the amount that the company must have on hand, so to speak, or be set aside, as the tax statute refers to it, to meet future claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.159" offset="2473100">The loading element is the difference between the gross premium and the net valuation premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.093" offset="2500895">It is, so to speak, analogous to a gross profit margin.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.516" offset="2514583">If you were to buy something at $10 and sell it at $15, you would have to pay out certain expenses out of the 5; but that $5 would be a gross profit margin, which is designed to cover various costs that you have and also have a profit and also to be able to pay dividends to your shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.372" offset="2585949">The life-insurance texts, and this is significant, all define a life-insurance reserve as derived from premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.889" offset="2620013">This is undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.599" offset="2626909">And the tax statute, Section 801(b)(1)(b) uses the term in defining reserves as amounts set aside to meet future claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.776" offset="2679572">It is essential that there be this set-aside notion so that the company has the amounts to cover its reserve liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.587" offset="2714890">So I think that it is fair to say that there is a direct and fundamental relationship between reserves and premiums, and indeed the decisions of this Court, the early tax decisions of this Court like McCoach versus Insurance Company of North America, New York Life-insurance company v. Edwards, speak in these terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.428" offset="2790227">They talk about amounts reserved from premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.719" offset="2807363">So I think that that aspect of the case is fairly well undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.730" offset="2827425">Turning now to the particular details of the Life-insurance company Income Tax Act of 1959, which the Court last considered in the Atlas Life-insurance company case, this statute recognizes that life-insurance companies are unlike the ordinary taxpayer and don't have unfettered discretion as to how to deal with their gross receipts, and they must set aside amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="705.120" offset="2920944">So it permits certain exclusions and deductions of amounts from two separate kinds of computations in order to cover the reserve liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.246" offset="2961486">This concept of reserve, which as I said is derived from premiums, is the central component of the statutory system.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.315" offset="2989802">And the statutory computations, which are indeed complicated, are essentially designed to measure the amounts that the company has to add to its reserves and to exclude them from tax or to provide for deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.533" offset="3046645">Now, there are two primary categories of computations.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.486" offset="3062423">There is a computation of taxable investment income, because as I said the company sets aside these amounts and they are going to earn interest and dividends on investments.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.038" offset="3100666">Indeed, as the Court said in Atlas, they must invest because if they do not they are not going to have enough under their assumptions to pay off the claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.093" offset="3128878">Then there is a second category, which the statute refers to as gain from operations, which is essentially income from all sources, including total taxable investment income plus all sorts of other income that the company has, for example, underwriting gains; in other words, the amount of premiums that it takes in less the amount of the claims that it has to pay out.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.670" offset="3215187">Now, the statute imposes a tax on the company’s taxable investment income plus one half of the amount by which its total gain from operations, that is the second category, exceeds its taxable investment income.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.410" offset="3282165">So essentially the whole statutory mechanics are designed to make these computations in order to determine what amounts have to be set aside from reserves and thereby excluded from tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.308" offset="3333783">Now, the phase-one computations, which we set forth in formula form, I think the most graphic way to understand it is to look at Page 6 of our brief, which sets forth a series of equations.</text>
            <text syncTime="825.459" offset="3402328">Although they seem rather onerous, they are really not when you sort of strip away some of the detail, because what you have essentially, you are trying to take the company’s total investment income and break it down between the amounts that are allocable to reserves and thereby are owned by the policyholders so to speak, and should be free of tax and the amount that the company earns for itself, which does not have to set aside and it does have to pay a tax on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.083" offset="3508803">So essentially looking at Page 6, the Court will see essentially three formulas and then a variation of the third formula.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.949" offset="3544330">But what essentially the statute prescribes is that the first thing that the company has to do is compute its earnings rate, and that simply is its investment income divided by its assets, and then it multiplies that earnings rate times its reserves and that yields its tax exclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.570" offset="3610785">And as you can see, that third formula essentially substitute for earnings rate its equivalent in the first formula, which is investment yield over assets, and so you have a formula that is investment yield divided by assets times reserves equals the tax exclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.944" offset="3688317">And to restate the formula, it is essentially you can see from the last where the equation was described that investment yield is multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is reserves and the denominator of which is assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.196" offset="3753309">There is one significant thing from this-phase one computational expressions, as we have set it out in the briefs, is that the amount of the exclusion -- that is, the amount of taxable investment income which is free of tax -- is based upon a proportionate relationship of total reserves to total assets.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.871" offset="3823944">Now, the phase-two computation is a much more traditional netting computation, which the Court is doubtless familiar from other income-tax cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.712" offset="3863337">That is, it essentially says take in your gross amount of premiums, and you subtract certain deductions.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.757" offset="3891549">That statute is set out in 809 of the Code, and essentially the unique deduction that the life-insurance companies are entitled to is set out in Section 809(d)(2); that is, it gets a deduction for its additions to reserves, because that amount of premium income is supposed to be set aside in order to meet policyholder claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.526" offset="3978589">I think with these sort of basics in mind, I can now turn to the facts of this case and put the matter in clear focus.</text>
            <text syncTime="979.764" offset="4019549">The respondent in this case is a life-insurance company in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.689" offset="4035223">It had deferred premiums, as most life-insurance companies do, and it also had due and unpaid or uncollected premiums, because it had a typical grace period of 31 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.139" offset="4097081">Now, there are certain things that the courts below set forth which are plain and undisputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1005.037" offset="4120695">The policyholder, of course, as the Chief Justice pointed out, has no obligation to pay deferred or uncollected premiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.192" offset="4149221">But, and this is important, respondent, the life-insurance company, had no obligation to continue the insurance coverage beyond the point for which the premiums had been paid, because nonpayment of the premiums -- it is not like a note at the bank -- results in the lapse of the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.944" offset="4216304">The only thing the policyholder is going to get is his cash surrender value on an ordinary whole-life policy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1107.246" offset="4529459">The other element of the statutory definition in Section 801(b)(1)(b) is that there would be an amount set aside to meet future claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.147" offset="4569061">I think the important thing about this case is that the reserves that it sets up, the full premium receipt assumption, so to speak, is simply that: an assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.813" offset="4619739">As we point in the brief and I will describe in greater detail later, it is based on a historical financial-reporting practice in which insurance companies for the last hundred years have been engaged in a full premium receipt assumption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1313.448" offset="5354302">But the fundamental point is that these reserves, although they are written up on the full net valuation portion of the premium, they are not really reserves in a real sense.</text>
