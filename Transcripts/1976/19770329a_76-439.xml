            <label>Mr. Charles H. Troutman, III</label>
            <text syncTime="51.333" offset="305841">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.120" offset="316917">The essence of this case is the ability of the Territory of Guam to determine for itself the type of court system it desires for its own local cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.657" offset="359131">The specific question presented in this case is whether Section 22 of the Organic Act of Guam, which is 48 United States Code 1424, permits the Legislature of the Guam to create an Appellate Division or rather create Supreme Court of Guam and transfer from the Appellate Division of the District Court to the Supreme Court of Guam all appeals from the lower courts of the Territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.365" offset="501969">A brief history of this litigation I believe is in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.947" offset="516284">First, in 1974, the Twelfth Guam Legislature decided that it was time to have the local court system in its opinion anyhow as autonomous as the rest of the Government had become.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.170" offset="593188">In 1950 the Organic Act created a civil government for the Territory of Guam and created, at that time, a legislator having legislative authority of raw matters of local interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.051" offset="652643">A Governor of Guam is also created who is an appointed official, appointed by the President, answerable to the Interior Department, and Section 22 of the Organic Act created a Court system similar too but significantly different from that in the other territories, probably most similar to that of the old years on the Territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.576" offset="746788">Then there were certain significant amendments in 1951 and 1958 which I shall discuss later, and then in 1970 the Elective Governor Act was adopted which gave Guam its first Elected Governor, elected locally.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.295" offset="821603">Then, in 1974, the Legislature of Guam and then that the local Codes of Guam which had previously, by the First Guam Legislature, created the Appellate Division of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.482" offset="878446">It amended these laws to provide for a Supreme Court of Guam and a superior court which was then the Superior Court being the court of local jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.311" offset="925675">As soon as a case could go through the process then Superior Court, it came up for appeal before the Supreme Court, this was the Agana Bay versus Dullingham (ph) case, and as soon as the Supreme Court had received it the Agana Bay Company petitioned to the District Court of Guam to issue a writ of prohibition declaring that the Supreme Court of Guam has no authority to hear appeals of any sort of lower court activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.176" offset="1077185">District Court of Guam then granted this writ which was there upon appeal to the Ninth Circuit, and in January 17th, 1976 the Ninth Circuit, a panel three judges reversed the District Court saying that the Supreme Court under the Organic Act did have a right to exist and hear cases on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.519" offset="1174570">Meanwhile the respondent in this case also had been convicted in the Superior Court of various crimes burglary, receiving stolen property, and assault with a deadly weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.467" offset="1230367">He had appealed both to the Supreme Court and the District Court on the generally held belief at that time that no one knew which Court would hear the appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.013" offset="1276552">As soon as the, Agana Bay decision came down, the District Court then reversed or rather denied the appeal in the Olsen case saying that it had no jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.250" offset="1321482">This denial was then appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and before the Ninth Circuit could act a petition for certiorari was filed by the respondents in this action which was denied, then the Ninth Circuit en banc without further brief of their argument reversed the opinion in the Agana Bay declaring that the Supreme Court of Guam could not hear and have no jurisdiction to hear appeals, because the Guam Legislature have no power to create one under the Organic Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.983" offset="1616352">Actually they were not to the Bar of Guam Your Honor, because the composition of the new court, the Supreme Court of Guam would have been almost identical to that of the Appellate Division of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.848" offset="1675807">In that the Chief Justice was the only Justice appointed and he was the member of the Bar and had to be member of the Bar of Guam, but he would designate two other associate justices from among a group which would include the District Judge with his consent, non involved judges of the Superior Court, or one of the judges of the High Court of the Trust Territory with their consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.563" offset="1794717">It is the same way that the Appellate Division does not constitute it under the Organic Act of Guam Section 22 (a) the second paragraph.</text>

            <text syncTime="623.315" offset="2593750">Yes Your Honor it would be because the Organic Act states that the - to begin with - that the District Court of Guam shall have such appellate jurisdiction as the Legislature of Guam determines.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.627" offset="2642965">So, that if the Legislature of Guam did not determined any jurisdiction regardless of what else it created, if it did not act to determine there was jurisdiction in the District Court, then it would not have any.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.317" offset="2705763">This is sort of a question that we are facing with many cases right now because the case below has said that the Legislature cannot transfer jurisdiction from the Appellant Division to a Supreme Court yet, but the Legislature has done this repeal any authorization of jurisdiction to the District Court and has not yet acted to replace it with anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="698.039" offset="2892591">The Organic Act of Guam is quite different from the Act of the Virgin Islands and other territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.965" offset="2916310">Most of the early western territories, actually expect Arizona, provided a complete court system.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.805" offset="2935641">They set up a Supreme Court, District Courts, Probate Courts, Justice of the Peace Courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.568" offset="2974720">In Arizona, however, they set up a court which said -- they set up a District Court with such other inferior courts as the legislature may or may not determine.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.256" offset="3025502">In the Virgin Islands today, the Legislature of the Virgin Islands today only has authority to create inferior courts and also has very limited authority to create exclusive jurisdiction in the courts it does create.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.403" offset="3090077">But, on Guam the Congress has said no such thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.173" offset="3105123">There is no -- the judicial authority of Guam is rested in not only the District Court, but in such court or courts as the Legislature may create.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.609" offset="3150890">There is no word anywhere in the judiciary section of the Organic Act which would act to mention the word ?inferior court? or should otherwise limit the Legislature in the type of courts that it would create.</text>

            <text syncTime="779.095" offset="3216823">Mr. Attorney General, what if any effect on this case does that 1976 legislation, congressional legislation have?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles H. Troutman, III</label>
            <text syncTime="788.984" offset="3256424">On the Guam Constitution relatively limited I believe Your Honor, for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="795.863" offset="3283905">The first is that it applies only to Guam Constitution which has not yet been written and the constitutional convention will be called, for later this year, June and under the time table Congress would not receive it until possibly early 1978, but there are presently approximately 40 cases on appeal wherever waiting decision on this case in the courts of Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.118" offset="3416921">So that there are -- we are talking now about existing law not as what it may be after the Guam Constitution has come about.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.562" offset="3474703">The second part of that question, Your Honor, from the history of the 1976 Legislation that passed would indicate the reason for Section 2 (b) (7) regarding the courts, was not so much that Congress is trying to interpret the existing Organic Act just because they were at a quandary to know how to interpret the situation in light of this continuing litigation, because at that time, and the time that was inserted the Ninth Circuit decision, en banc decision, had come down but certiorari had not yet been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.784" offset="3631647">So, they assume that that decision was final and acted accordingly.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.325" offset="3689743">I think that the congressional intent if you can find any in the original Organic Act is not as respondents would urge that Guam could not barred completely from creating this type of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.300" offset="3753691">Congress originally considered two versions of the Organic Act two or three in which they created in these proposals various forms of a court system similar to a State Court system, in other words they said this is the system and treated it more as a Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.553" offset="3822655">However, they rejected all of these versions and came out with what is now 22 (a) of the Organic Act, plus other parts which have since been amended.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.376" offset="3889946">In fact later in 1951 when they realized how much appellate jurisdiction the legislature had given them, they were forced to amend the judiciary section so that appeals would go from the Appellant Division to the Ninth Circuit as it was desired at that time to the simpler reason that before the 1951 amendment there is a limited right of appeal to the Ninth Circuit in matters and felonies and in excess of $3,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.253" offset="4021499">Now, everything below that was not appealable but these were just the matters that were being appealed to the Appellant Division of the District Court, so there is a desire that they were not embarrass at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.401" offset="4066116">Then in 1958 it was determined that with the increasing amount of appeals again the former system of assigning judges to the District Court was still found workable chiefly because of the distance they were assigned by the Chief Justice of this Court, and also they came from Article III Courts of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.433" offset="4182204">So, it was amended to provide the designation of associate judges for this Appellate Division would be provided by the presiding judge of the Appellate Division from among judges able to sit on the District Court, namely judges who had been designated by either the Chief Justice or the presiding, the Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit, and also from judges of the High Court of the Trust Territory which incidentally has no judicial jurisdiction over Guam whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.072" offset="4332774">It is also interesting for comparison to note the Government of the Northern Mariana has recently passed also.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.513" offset="4366524">While there they did provide for the proper route to appeal to an Article III Court, they did that because all of the parties were then knowledgeable that, were then quite aware that the Northern Marianas would probably eventually be creating its own courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.282" offset="4441548">But the language giving jurisdiction to its Appellant Division is very similar to that found in the Organic Act of Guam.</text>

            <text syncTime="1117.234" offset="4569443">We are not here talking about the authority of the Guam to create lower courts, in other words courts of general jurisdiction, but Section 402 (c) says that District Court -- and I am referring to the Northern Marianas -- the District Court will have such appellate jurisdiction as the constitutional or laws of the Northern Mariana Islands may provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.558" offset="4666723">Then they go on to save when it sits as an appellate Court, the District Court will consist of three judges, at least one of whom will be a judge of the Court of record of the Northern Mariana Island.</text>
            <text syncTime="1152.075" offset="4708728">So, the first sentence of this is very similar to that in the Organic Act of Guam referring to appeals where it says in Section 22 (a) talking about jurisdiction, the District Court of -- it says, it shall have original jurisdiction and all other causes in Guam, jurisdiction over which has not been transferred by the legislature to other courts established by it, and shall have such appellant jurisdiction as a legislature may determine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1331.195" offset="5425215">Well, that possibly -- that particular question has not been addressed in the Court Reorganization Act because its jurisdictional statement is that, jurisdiction lies in the Superior Court in all cases arising under the Laws of Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.289" offset="5489580">So, there actually is a gap there of two types of cases which go to the District Court: One type I believe probably would be diversity since Guam has no provisions itself for diversity per se, and also cases that probably arise under, say, another law but I heard on Guam, litigation is going on one of those at the present time, for instance, which arise under the Laws of the Trust Territory but the parties are found in Guam and the case is pursued there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.781" offset="5659585">We would further argue that the appeal to a District Court advanced to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is not actually a matter of right that was established by the original Organic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.336" offset="5721861">Under the original Organic Act there was no right to appeal to the District Courts to begin with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1416.234" offset="5765433">This right had to be made when it was made by the Legislature of Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.485" offset="5786436">This was done in the First Guam Legislature by a really a Clerk -- separate divisions what they called it an Appellant Division of the District Court, but that was a creature of Guam and not of the Organic Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.203" offset="5853309">Our argument further is that the subsequent amendments do not, in essence, repeal or admit that right of Guam to change its original act in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.886" offset="5928019">In other words, the second paragraph of Section 22 of the Organic Act, where it starts appeals to the District Court of Guam shall be heard and determined by an Appellant Division and so forth, this does not state that appeals cannot be heard any place else, but merely provides the system that is developed that should be heard if and assuming the Guam Legislature continuously appeals to the Appellant Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.677" offset="6087157">Guam has progressed far in its ability to Organic Act of Guam and we are not arguing -- our whole argument here is that this is permitted within the Organic Act as it presently exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.664" offset="6143164">In our view the Organic Act of Guam represents maximum flexibility to Guam in determining the form of government for the Territory in a much greater degree than it has been provided by the Organic Acts of the various others territories and possessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.656" offset="6231040">In the Florida case I cited in our brief is the American Ocean Insurance versus 365 Bales of Cottons, court back imply there was territory ruled that the court, that Congress may give to a territory either the jurisdictions it wants to in a court system or permit that territory to give either what is normally federal jurisdiction or local jurisdiction to a court of its choice.</text>

            <text syncTime="1574.806" offset="6399686">Because very specifically elsewhere at least in recent history it spells out how the courts are to operate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.792" offset="6427585">In the Virgin Islands it is very specific that, they state that the local jurisdiction may not, rather it may create only inferior courts and then it actually provides that jurisdiction of the rather appeals may be taken, rather shall be taken from the lower courts created by the jurisdiction but this Virgin Island too the District Court of the Virgin Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.274" offset="6549525">So, that this is specifically stated in old Hawaii when it was a territory, the Congress actually created the Supreme Court and permitted inferior courts to be created and created certain intermediate courts also, but there again referring to inferior courts as the problems of the Hawaii Legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="1901.193" offset="7705286">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.470" offset="7726393">Mr. Justice Stevens asked a question, the answer to which being given, I was shocked to hear it because I believe his question was, Well what if the Ninth Circuit?s decisions, upheld under Supreme Court of Guam, remain stricken down at the present time, be any right of appeal in Guam at all, and I believe the General Troutman?s answer was, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.998" offset="7816463">I submit that the answer to that question definitely is yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.022" offset="7832555">Because it is a common canon of statutory construction that if a statute is amended and if for some reason -- and it is obvious that the intent is not to do away with remedy that was given, for example, such a case as this, there was no intension to do these appeals all together, but rather to direct appeals through a different route and to a different court is that repealer, and the substitute law were declared invalid and of course the original law would spring back into being.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.629" offset="7962958">And under Section 55 of the Guam Court Reorganization Act, it says, every reference in law, rule, or regulation to the Island Court shall be read in mean to Superior Court of Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.179" offset="8009143">It means we would still have the old law with the change which would not be invalid if changing the old Island Court named the Superior Court, and then the law under the Ninth Circuit?s latest decision would simply read that you can take appeals from the Superior Court of Guam to the Appellant Division of the District Court of Guam.</text>

            <text syncTime="2007.233" offset="8129410">In the first statute, they say, we hereby withdraw all appellate jurisdiction from the District Court, and that goes into affect, and I guess they have the power to do that under the Organic Act and then secondly, a year later, they had passed the statute saying, now appeals will be taken to the newly created Guam Supreme Court, and then we knocked out the second statute, I suppose then there would be no appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="2058.005" offset="8332539">I do not think that there is anything in the language of the Organic Act which prevents that but I think we are not -- the Government seems to take some comfort from the fact that there is no such language but I think that they are not talking about the real world, they are not talking about the world that the Congress expect it would obtain in Guam and that is the say that real world invariably appeals, and a certain number of instances are always allowed by Legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="2194.476" offset="8878393">I think that if we analyze that language carefully in the first place, we look at the first sense which says, in what courts the judicial authority shall reside, but it does not say what courts can be created.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.096" offset="8928862">I mean you look at the second sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.315" offset="8937743">In the second sentence it says that original jurisdiction can be transferred, appellate jurisdiction can be determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.298" offset="8969613">Now, I think we have to think of this in a chronological and rationale way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.529" offset="8994586">There is no appellate jurisdiction unless, first there is some original jurisdiction which has been transferred.</text>
            <text syncTime="2229.202" offset="9017260">So it seems to me that the plain language, if we apply the plain language rule to this second sentence, then what Congress is saying is, well look, we are going to have a District Court of Guam and that District Court of Guam is going to have all jurisdictions and of course, there will be appeals to the Ninth Circuit and to an Article III Court from that District Court of Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.996" offset="9108480">Now, it may be that the Guam Legislature wants to setup its own courts of original jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2258.075" offset="9132721">Alright, they can do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.521" offset="9138573">They can take that jurisdiction which is in the District Court of Guam and they can transfer it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.245" offset="9157486">Well, what about appeals them?</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.977" offset="9164382">Well, in that event then an appellate jurisdiction for the District Court can be determined and appeals can then go from these new courts of original jurisdiction, but these cases will nevertheless go up through the District Court which is a creature of statute, the Congress rather.</text>

            <text syncTime="2393.867" offset="9675964">In the way it happens to come about to be three judges is that a year after the Organic Act was enacted, the Guam Legislature decided to determine appellate jurisdiction in the District Court, and in doing that it passed Public Law 17 which setup an Appellate Division within the District Court, and it provided that there would be three judges, not just the judge appointed by the President of the United States as the Judge of the Territorial District Court of Guam, but two other judges originally to be designated to set temporary status by the Chief Justice of United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.064" offset="9828728">Now, this was on the books for some years when the Congress apparently decided to recognize what the Guam Legislature has done and enacted an amendment to the Organic Act which, I submit to this Court, shows that the Congress only intended for the District Court of Guam to have appellate jurisdiction, because if the Guam Legislature have the power to simply create appellate courts then you could say well by creating the Appellate Division they have created the Appellate Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.889" offset="9952026">But the Congress felt it was necessary to go a step further and legitimize what they had done with further legislation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2521.022" offset="10184516">When you say traditional, now everything local has been transferred, but for many years the probate jurisdiction was called the Island Court of Guam which is really no more than the predecessor of the Superior Court which is the Island Court with an enlarged scope of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.752" offset="10259435">I might say that this is a very unusual thing that General Troutman is attributing to the Congress to say that in effect to Guam Legislature can make the very highest tribunal in Guam, the highest Appellate Court that is to say, for example, the Guam Supreme Court, the play thing of the Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.016" offset="10332578">I think it would be very unusual to have a system of government where the legislature could simply, at any moment, abolish the Guam Supreme Court, change its jurisdiction, respectively fire the judges and have all new judges appointed for whatever political reason they might think fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.588" offset="10394854">And Guam does have a record of, the Guam Legislature does have a record and I am presently a senator of that Legislature but I was not a part of this scheme about just a few years ago whereby they would switch the appointing power back and forth between the Governor and the Legislature depending upon who is in power and how it suited them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2594.323" offset="10477714">So, if the Guam Supreme Court is to be upheld, I think that I can pretty well guarantee to this Court that it will, very definitely, be the play thing of the Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.352" offset="10521913">The Constitutional Convention Act definitely has a great deal of effect upon this present case, because the language is different by far then we find in the present Organic Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2635.979" offset="10644375">Congress did not use it before. If Congress wished to delegate to the Guam Legislature in 1950 an authority to establish a system of local courts, one might think that they would have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2648.358" offset="10693903">They have said so for the first time in the Constitutional Convention Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.336" offset="10709786">Also we can see that Congress agrees that this matter is certainly not put to rest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3134.800" offset="12639712">I welcome the opportunity to carry on the discussion that we previously had with Mr. Trapp.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.339" offset="12673776">When the question was first raised here I was equally shocked as Mr. Trapp that there would be no right of appeal in Guam where this Court to affirm and strike down the Supreme Court of Guam, and I quite agree with Mr. Trapp?s views on the subject matter of that very point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.275" offset="12757577">To answer Mr. Justice Marshall I would say this that the Article VI Section 3 provision of the Constitution, which grants plenary power to the Congress to control the Territory of Guam, is the authority that this Court needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3183.457" offset="12834272">I suggest and it has never been before this Court or any other Court so far as I know, if Congress were to expressly grant to Guam the right to contain its own appeals that that might be construed as an invalid delegation by Congress of its plenary powers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3245.608" offset="13082854">Now, if your controversy was not more than $2000 and you are appealing from the Supreme Court of Washington, you could not get to an Article III Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3255.386" offset="13122037">The only thing that I can answer that is that those provisions may have been invalid under that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.521" offset="13150563">To develop the argument let us review the Elective Governor Bill of the Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.240" offset="13185463">Before the Elective Governor Bill, the Governor of Guam was appointed by the President, and at that time the laws of Guam were subject to annulment by Congress after one year or within one year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.796" offset="13251605">Now, since the Elective Governor Bill has been in effect Congress has expressly said, ?we reserve the right to annul any law of Guam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.282" offset="13297580">In effect, they have given Guam something but they have taken it back.</text>

            <text syncTime="3327.075" offset="13408757">Now, Guam was set up in a traditional sense of three equal branches of government and, if we are to say that the Guam judiciary is without the control of congress, that is, congress says, ?You may create your own judiciary and we have no control over it?.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.530" offset="13482632">But we have recognized that we have to control the laws of Guam on the Executive Branch, then I say that we do not have an equal division of our branches of government.</text>

            <text syncTime="3494.631" offset="14078955">Well, I think, in conclusion, I can not add anymore, and I think that this Court has taken a proper step in reviewing the matter and should take it to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3505.916" offset="14124095">I have said in the amicus brief that I feel that the language that has been used in unfortunate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.455" offset="14146246">It really has not clarified anything for us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.969" offset="14160352">I agree with Justice Rehnquist when I first read the statute, when my brother at the Bar first took his attack at it, I was wondering why he was taking on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.237" offset="14205388">It just seemed to me to be so self evident, but if you reread it and consider it with the legislative material that we have at the beginning of Guam?s organic history; then it becomes clear to me that we do not have a mandate from Congress that Guam can do what it wants.</text>
