            <text syncTime="10.126" offset="140979">The respondent in this case was employed by United Air Lines as a flight attendant in November 1966 through February 1968.</text>

            <text syncTime="33.694" offset="235228">The question presented by this case is whether the employer has committed a second violation of Title VII by refusing to credit her with seniority for any period prior to February of 1972 when she was rehired.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.934" offset="296250">The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that United had violated the Act because its seniority system perpetuated the effects of past discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.866" offset="339927">For reasons stated and an opinion filed with the clerk, we conclude that United's seniority system is neutral in operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.867" offset="372005">We then reversed the contrary decision of the Court of Appeals.</text>
