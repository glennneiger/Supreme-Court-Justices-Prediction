            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="100551">We will hear arguments next in 75-1019, Boston Stock Exchange against State Tax Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.244" offset="309426">Mr. Pascal I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roger_pascal" startTime="55.563" stopTime="310.977">
            <label>Mr. Roger Pascal</label>
            <text syncTime="55.563" offset="322801">Mr. Chief Justice may I please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.920" offset="336175">This case raises the constitutionality of a 1969 Amendment to the New York Stock Transfer Tax which discriminates against interstate commerce by taxing stock transactions involving sales of stock outside New York far more heavily than similar transactions involving sales within the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.744" offset="423424">Our clients, the plaintiffs, appellants in this case are the principle stock exchangers in the United States located outside the State of New York, located in the states of Massachusetts, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.648" offset="483088">These exchangers compete, your honor, with stock exchangers located within the State of New York and indeed with each other to provide efficient, fair and orderly markets for the purchase and sale of securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.872" offset="540035">Indeed, the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 recognize explicitly the public interest in fair competition among exchange markets to provide the fair and orderly markets that I have referred to.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.871" offset="603983">In this record of this case there is evidence, all be not at a trial in the legislative history of Section 270-a of Competition in Specific Securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.559" offset="662706">In 1968, the year in which this statute was passed 88% of the share trading on the exchanges who are plaintiffs here wasn’t securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.718" offset="711398">In 1968, that same year and prior to that time the Governor and Legislature of New York perceive what I would suggest as apparel, a competitive apparel of what one legislative witness characterized as the “competitive problems from non-New York Exchanges.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.101" offset="792900">In 1968, New York reacted to that apparel by enacting a statute which added Section 270-a to the New York Stock Transfer Tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.956" offset="832293">In his message of approval the Governor sighted and I am quoting again, “the greatly expanded capacity of the regional exchanges to challenge the New York exchanges for business”.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.512" offset="874507">Regional exchanges are what people in the business in New York called exchanges outside of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.029" offset="900629">The Governor also stated that Section 270-a had as another of its purposes to provide and I am quoting again, “long-term relief from some of the competitive pressures from outside the State”.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.769" offset="947545">The non-New York exchanges filed suit in the New York State courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.407" offset="966144">In the State courts because the anti-tax injunction statute for declaration that Section 270-a was repugnant to the commerce clause and other clauses of the United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.748" offset="1015464">The defendants named were the State agency charged with enforcing that statute, collecting the tax and the members of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.703" offset="1047333">Trial Court denied a motion to dismiss which was the defendants’ response to the complaint and under New York procedure that denial, the motion to dismiss was appealed, was a matter of right, it was appealed and the appellate division of the New York Supreme Court reversed, ordered the complaint dismissed and the New York Court of Appeals affirmed that dismissal, holding Section 270-a to be constitutional and not to violate the commerce clause and other clauses of the constitution under which it was challenged in the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.439" offset="1178259">This case is here on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.953" offset="1188290">The question presented here, Your Honor is whether a State Tax on the sale, transfer or delivery of securities, stocks in this case which discriminates on the basis of whether the sale portion of a taxable transaction takes place inside or outside the State of New York violates the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.652" offset="1275121">Especially whereas here it is uncontested indeed proclaimed by the defendants that the vowed purpose and the actual effect of the statute was to confer a State created advantage on local stock exchanges at the expense of their out of State competitors.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="310.977" offset="1344398">The challenge here is only on the commerce clause.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roger_pascal" startTime="313.293" stopTime="314.802">
            <label>Mr. Roger Pascal</label>
            <text syncTime="313.293" offset="1353697">That is correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="314.802" stopTime="318.917">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="314.802" offset="1359758">Whatever else relied on the State Court to abandon.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roger_pascal" startTime="318.917" stopTime="424.758">
            <label>Mr. Roger Pascal</label>
            <text syncTime="318.917" offset="1376162">That is correct; we have dropped the other two claims in the complaint which were the Privileges and Immunities Clause and the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.585" offset="1414824">The discrimination which I have been referring to Your Honors was the, I would suggest direct result of New York’s reaction of the apparel of competition, and the mechanism of the discrimination was to add two tax reductions in two large areas, and I say large because very little is left of pre-1968 scheme after the addition of these two areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.563" offset="1510745">The first was the inclusion in Section 270-a of a new limited or maximum tax of $350, actually it was more than $350 when it was passed but gradually reduced to $350 by the year 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.253" offset="1573544">Since 1973, therefore, no matter how many shares of stock one sells, one is subject to a maximum tax of $350 if and only if this is the only variable the transaction takes place, the sale part of the transaction on the stock exchange takes place inside the State and not outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.111" offset="1656927">The second aspect of Section 270-a, which we suggest discriminates openly on the basis only of where the sale takes place is a new -- what I have chosen referred to is a non-resident discount.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.572" offset="1710739">Whereby, non-residents of the State of New York pay precisely by 1973 and since that time one-half the tax they would pay if they were to execute their transactions that is make their sales inside New York -- they pay half as much if they execute inside New York as if they sell their securities outside New York.</text>

          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="424.758" stopTime="432.450">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="424.758" offset="1799555">Mr. Pascal sometime during your argument are you are going to treat the effect of the enactment of Section 28-d of the Securities Act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roger_pascal" startTime="432.450" stopTime="511.203">
            <label>Mr. Roger Pascal</label>
            <text syncTime="432.450" offset="1830275">Yes, in fact, let me move to that right now Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.529" offset="1870608">Section 28-d which is referred to in our reply brief as well as the appellee's brief had the effect of making transfers by a registered transfer agent non-taxable, the legislative history of 28-d is that was an accident.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.486" offset="1970396">As we pointed out in our jurisdictional statement did not repeat in our briefs, “the Congress did not intend nor did the President intend in signing it to reduce the impact of the section about which we are complaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.357" offset="2033926">President made a statement that he would sign remedial legislation and both Houses of Congress, the Chairman of the appropriate committees made similar statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.975" offset="2068407">The fact is the remedial legislation has not occurred as we stand here right now and obviously will not during the session of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.494" offset="2098500">But Section 28-d clearly does not moot the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.219" offset="2113338">Number one, the appellees themselves, certainly I can speak for the appellants, they do not think it has been mooted or we would have so advised the Court.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_h_rehnquist" startTime="511.203" stopTime="521.029">
            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="511.203" offset="2145312">But whether or not it moots it, it conceivably could have an effect on the burden that the New York tax does put on Congress.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roger_pascal" startTime="521.029" stopTime="630.394">
            <label>Mr. Roger Pascal</label>
            <text syncTime="521.029" offset="2184600">That is true Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.397" offset="2190138">If there is one, just one registered transfer agent in New York it will reduce the number of transactions it would otherwise be taxable and subject to this discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.498" offset="2230471">There are certain categories, however that are completely ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.538" offset="2246667">For example, deliveries to people living in New York the large institutional purchasers, sellers of securities, deliveries buy and two such persons are ineffective.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.872" offset="2287940">The appellees themselves have included I think appropriately an Appendix C in their brief which consists of the opinion of their counsel Mr. Crotty, this is a counsel to the State of New York Department of Taxation and Finance holding at Page 31 of the appellees brief, Mr. Crotty says in discussing, this is an opinion dated December 1, 1975, in discussing the impact of the 1975 amendments, I think general quite accurately, “however, where a sale, Agreement to Sell, Memorandum of Sale or any other delivery or transfer takes place in New York State, the stock transfer tax due and owing thereon must be paid."</text>
            <text syncTime="590.375" offset="2462020">He is telling us that wherever transfers continue to take place and non-registered transfer agents, whenever there is a delivery the same Section 270-a and the rest of the stock transfer tax continues to apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.761" offset="2515519">So, I would suggest certainly, Mr. Crotty who was given as a fairly brief but concise and definitive opinion of the New York Department of Taxation and Finance of which by the way the defendant commission in this case is a part.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.188" offset="2577273">I think he can be taken at his word and I do not think we really have a dispute as to how 28-d operates or the impact of Section 270-a after the 1975 amendments.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="630.394" stopTime="642.359">
            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="630.394" offset="2622099">Mr. Pascal would you give a example, two of deliveries, of securities in New York that would not be affected by the amendment to the Act of 34 but still be covered by the New York statute?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roger_pascal" startTime="642.359" stopTime="689.859">
            <label>Mr. Roger Pascal</label>
            <text syncTime="642.359" offset="2669955">Yes, Mr. Justice Powell, I might be basically trying to summarize one or two examples given on Page 8 of our yellow reply brief but the one that we give first and the one that I think is somewhat classic is an example of New York Life Insurance Company, purchasing securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.187" offset="2745292">It is either required by law to have a custodial agreement or to take possession of those securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.191" offset="2777266">It is required in other words this hypothetical New York Institutional Investor or Life Insurance Company in the example I have given, to take possession of those securities, when it takes possession whether it takes possession from a registered transfer agent or from its own broker the mere delivery is taxable under the transfer tax now as always.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lewis_f_powell_jr" startTime="689.859" stopTime="707.489">
            <label>Justice Lewis F. Powell, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="689.859" offset="2859918">So even after the transfer, which would be exempt under the transfer on the books by the transfer agent would be exempt under the Federal Act if the securities in the name of the life insurance company were delivered to New York that would be a taxable transaction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roger_pascal" startTime="707.489" stopTime="802.745">
            <label>Mr. Roger Pascal</label>
            <text syncTime="707.489" offset="2930448">That is correct, that is precisely the situation right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.147" offset="2953122">Delivery is an important event and it is one that occurs frequently in New York and it is one that persists and it is one that persists particularly with regard to the large institutional investors in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.292" offset="3001710">In fact, that would suggest wholly aside from mootness and even in terms of the significance of the case, in terms of the kinds of considerations that the Court normally gives at the beginning of a case ignoring jurisdiction that has not changed one bit.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.053" offset="3060747">We have in the books in New York Court of Appeals right now, the decision with in a State of enormous economic power, a very far reaching decision that condones a discriminatory tax scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.319" offset="3105782">I think unlike anything close to anything the Court has ever dealt with and found to pass constitutional muster on the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.148" offset="3149041">The appellees refer to the extensive regulations promulgated by the defendants under the transfer tax they are indeed extensive, but there I would direct the Court’s attention to Section 440.1-i 12 rather simple regulation which just lists a number of different types of taxable transactions and further answer to Mr. Justice Powell’s question, one of those types of transactions is the delivery of a certificate by the transferor or his agent and his broker to the transferee or his agent that is unchanged.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_brennan_jr" startTime="802.745" stopTime="807.446">
            <label>Justice William J. Brennan, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="802.745" offset="3311522">What kind of transaction gets the benefit of the new 29-c?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="roger_pascal" startTime="807.446" stopTime="854.035">
            <label>Mr. Roger Pascal</label>
            <text syncTime="807.446" offset="3330331">Well, the transaction where for example I suppose and I would suggest Mr. Justice Brennan and this was not intended but it does probably is the effect right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.239" offset="3377455">The transaction where delivery is not made in New York that is some part of the transaction takes place there but it is made outside New York, where no delivery is made at all or delivery is made to -- I suppose a registered depository or clearing agency, but if delivery is made that part is unchanged, and I would add that the policing of the transfer tax is done through the brokers in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.107" offset="3480900">So again, you can see how the delivery still is something the State can and does get at and according to the appellees’ brief and Mr. Crotty’s opinion intends to get it.</text>

            <text syncTime="854.035" offset="3516636">Have we any idea of the proportion where of transactions in which there are deliveries thus subject to the tax in the proportion where they are not perhaps outside the New York tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="881.136" offset="3624992">There is certainly nothing in the record and I really cannot add anything to it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Roger Pascal</label>
            <text syncTime="894.838" offset="3679849">Yes Mr. Justice Blackmun I am, I think it has baring in the sense that while the court and the opinion of the court reports to be confronting a situation of First Impression according to the language of the opinion of the court and as reemphasized by Mr. Justice Stevens concurring opinion and that situation of First Impression is not present here.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.229" offset="3801371">The court does reinforce what I would call some very steady, consistent varieties regarding discrimination against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.480" offset="3838464">I think that the Court itself in Hughes made clear that it was dealing with a situation involving the State itself, State of Maryland and Hughes really becoming the entrepreneur if you will and bidding up the price of haux I think of taking the Court, the language of the Court in the majority opinion said until today the Court has not been asked to hold that the entry by the state itself into the market, as a purchaser and goes on to talk about the bidding up of haux.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.900" offset="3988094">I think that distinguishes the case by itself Mr. Justice Blackmun because there is no suggestion here that that is what has been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.707" offset="4023307">Indeed, I would suggest that the State of New York could have if the New York exchanges and their continued presence in New York were so important to the State and it has continued economic liability, it could easily have done something like the State of Maryland did.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.735" offset="4083389">It could have decided to subsidies, by cast subsidies as Mr. Justice Steven suggested or by a real estate tax rebate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.859" offset="4115885">It could have done something that would not have impeded interstate commerce, what it could not do was pass a statute the whole purpose of which was to, in essence shift the economic burden of keeping the exchanges located in New York to their other state competitors, which is precisely the economic effect of what State of New York did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.513" offset="4202507">The defendants and the Court of Appeals, New York Court of Appeals have offered us some, what I would suggest our excuses for the result reached in the Court of Appeals and for Section 270-a, rather than avoidance as if you will that is there is nowhere in the Court of Appeals indeed to the contrary it is assumed that Section 270-a does create a discrimination, I do not think that is an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.244" offset="4325491">One excuse suggested by the defendants, but really not by the Court of Appeals is that somehow you can split up the various elements of the transaction, I do not think that that is a viable theory or has it been for quite a long time at least since Nippert againts Richmond and cases of that kind where the court discussed the breath of the mind of man in devising ways of fragmenting a transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.632" offset="4443042">The motivation of protecting the local business is something on which we can agree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.976" offset="4472404">I would suggest that ever since Baldwin against Seelig the Halliburton Oil Well Company against Reily, Nippert against Richmond.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.571" offset="4514827">The kind of discrimination we have here whether it is tax imposed discrimination or regulatory impose discrimination, it makes no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.479" offset="4546383">Indeed, Freeman against Hewit one of the cases cited by defendants suggested that the tax type of discriminatory barrier could be worst.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.793" offset="4579715">I think that reinforced in Mr. Justice Brennan’s opinion and Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company against Cottrell last term also in which the court said that a state cannot erect economic barriers to protect local business for competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.221" offset="4633423">I think that’s one of the varieties which I was referring to that would not fly here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.900" offset="4656097">What do we have here, we have statements in the briefs and motion to dismiss by the appellee’s that the purpose of Section 270-a was to protect a major industry, to protect and preserve the state securities industry and this one to make New York the financial center of the world that is proclaimed in the motion to dismiss to be one of the purposes of Section 270-a.</text>

            <text syncTime="1166.974" offset="4768424">The court of appeals also suggested that the and, I must say it is an argument that is somewhat unique so one cannot sight a string of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.968" offset="4816384">The Court of Appeal suggested that the state was free to discriminate among different types of interstate transactions that what was really being done here was discrimination among all numbers of transactions, all which were interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.714" offset="4871346">Of course, we could go to Halliburton to see that in almost every case where that kind of situation occur, where you had discriminatory tax or regulatory burden you could be comparing cases all of which had interstate elements, it is important here and what I think is really again undisputed is that here we have a situation, where the discrimination operates based on whether a particular, very important element of the transaction occurs inside or outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.167" offset="4997152">Again, the Court of Appeals suggests and this relates also to the protection of local businesses point that it can neutralize the advantages of the place of origin that is since New York has already imposed the tax they can even up the odds as it were with the out of state businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1243.931" offset="5076251">That precise language virtually is what is used by the court in Baldwin against G. A. F. Seelig, to say that you cannot do it and it was reinforced in Halliburton having imposed the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.281" offset="5121599">New York might subsidize its businesses and might grant tax rebates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.049" offset="5136646">It could do a lot of things to help local businesses, but it could not neutralize the advantages of the other states and the securities markets...</text>

            <text syncTime="1275.702" offset="5203310">Finally there is a suggestion in the Courts of Appeals argument that the practical effect, that is a quote of a phrase I believe from Best against Maxwell, the practical effect of the tax is somewhat de minimis because New York residents are likely to execute their transactions within New York that of course is not only not born out by the record, but it flies directly into the face of legislative history of those who passed it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.890" offset="5336012">The very assumption of Section 270-a was that within the modern age, with modern telecommunication and computer systems where everybody has access to the various markets instantaneously and where the instantaneous communication may gain, especially a large institutional seller, such as exist in New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.687" offset="5415215">Particular advantage that the, all markets will open to everybody and therefore to suggest that as a practical matter the New York institutions and other sellers and buyers of securities who stay in New York because of geographic propinquity is something that is absolutely unsupported in fact belied by the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1835.725" offset="7443362">28(d) merely limited the tax or exempted the tax for transfers within the State of New York not on another types of transactions within the State, that power was not affected by Congress whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.653" offset="7515147">Now I do not really, the question was asked earlier about the relevancy of this huge decision that was handed down last June.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.722" offset="7555375">As I read the opinion there it constitutionally was sustained because it was a legitimate purpose of the State of Maryland for the protection of its environment to do something about ridding itself of those junk automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1883.563" offset="7634788">It looks important from an environmental point of view to preserve the State of Maryland I think for the same reason it is important to the State of New York for its economy to remain wholesome for the same reasons and the cases relied upon by the plaintiffs here were all reviewed and passed upon in the Hughes opinions of last spring and also in the earlier case of the Atlantic and Pacific Company case it was handed down the first part of last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.440" offset="7778252">The cases relied upon therein are precisely the same as those which are relied upon by the plaintiffs here, now in the A&amp;P case this court found that the very same cases were controlling as to the facts there involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.504" offset="7850559">But when it came to the Hughes case case four or five months later the same cases were rejected by the majority here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.333" offset="7889847">So that our position is that all of these cases, plaintiff site have got to be distinguished upon their facts and upon the illegal principles involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.995" offset="7940525">Now some of those were involved a license to engage in interstate commerce which has been forbidden under the commerce clause or there was a gross receipts tax on the gross proceeds from the interstate commerce, and others were involved other types of drumming situation in sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.681" offset="8047209">Now none of those cases are in point here because we are not licensing anyone here and we are not imposing upon a privilege for someone to engage in its sales transaction within the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.009" offset="8120561">Every stockholder in this country is free to buy and sell his stock on any exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.904" offset="8148146">The tax is only applied by New York where there is a sale within the State of New York, or a subsequent transfer within the State by a corporate transfer agent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.999" offset="8212512">Unless those events occur, no tax is paid by anybody regardless of where the sale maybe made, whether it is on plaintiffs’ exchanges or off-the-counter or over-the-counter type of transaction, and it seems ironic to us that the plaintiffs are complaining that the competitive standing of our New York stock exchanges in comparison to theirs and that the State ought to offer bounties or subsidies to our own exchanges similar to what was done in Hughes situation, merely begs this little question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.420" offset="8382203">New York has done something to equalize a competitive standing and it did so by the enactment of the special tax inducement provisions of Section 270(a) of the tax law to encourage out-of-state investors to continue to engage within the State of New York and they offered non-resident citizens a tax reduction in order to do that, and it offered on the other hand that the large block sale investors special tax inducements if they traded within the State of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.280" offset="8533609">However, they are still free to trade anywhere where there is a market for them, and we do not think that that is a burden upon the interstate commerce, in fact it is a direct inducement to engage in interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="3273.533" offset="13194585">Well Mr. Justice Brennan, the injury in fact to which Mr. Justice White referred is the direct open-bald attempt by the state to take her customers away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.661" offset="13243173">It is competition standing and that is why the Court of Appeals as well as both courts below in New York rejected the defendants standing argument, relying indeed in the Court of Appeals as I recall upon camp  data processing and also, there really is no difference between New York and this court’s standing doctrine because the New York Court of Appeals sighted it also.</text>

            <text syncTime="3352.881" offset="13512025">I think in a non-administrative procedure case we have, Pierce against Society of Sisters which was among other things, a standing case and I think that that is another case, that would apply here where you have the or true acts against Race where you have the employee who’s employer, is required to discriminate against aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.820" offset="13599797">The employee who is going to be the subject and who is really going to be burdened could complain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.923" offset="13616202">I am not suggesting that these exchanges are the only potential plaintiffs here but if you compare the exchanges who are -- this is I think a rare thing in State Legislative history Mr. Justice Rehnquist, you actually have the targets of this legislation named in the legislative history that the defendants put in the record, their name.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.664" offset="13691121">They are actually foreseen as the targets of the legislation, the competitors of the local exchanges and against them, the legislation is aimed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3414.956" offset="13760293">They could say that this is a form of economic coercion that reduces their choices to where they -- I referred earlier for example to competition between the exchanges …</text>

            <text syncTime="3437.046" offset="13848691">I think that’s right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.906" offset="13860081">I would suggest that the legislative history is an unusual source of material to dispose of any injury, in fact problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.803" offset="13903758">I would also like briefly to discuss the -- suggesting the case maybe less worthy of consideration which Justice Blackmun mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.900" offset="13936149">I don’t think the legal principle is any less worthy of consideration regardless of how the dollar may have change, and I would agree that Section 28(d) really changes it much more than what we complain of here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.818" offset="13983797">Finally, I would have to say that the Big Mac Argument if I can call it that is one that just plain surprises me but it is an easy one to respond to because to quote from the appellee’s brief on page 3, Section 11 to which he referred, this is of the same statute we challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.567" offset="14070732">The possibility of this particular Section being on constitution occurred to the New York Legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="3498.481" offset="14094451">Section 11, requires the re-reimposition of the higher taxes, the higher rates of taxation without distinction between sales by nonresidential or large blocks, if Section 270(a) is declared unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.606" offset="14142935">We are doing New York a favor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3527.838" offset="14211898">We have never challenged in any court or even whispered the suggestion that we are attacking anything more than Section 270(a) of the transfer tax which does not impose any tax.</text>
