            <label>Mr. Geoffrey M. Kalmus</label>
            <text syncTime="44.240" offset="277428">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please court.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.174" offset="289131">My name is Geoffrey Kalmus; I am a partner in a private firm in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.187" offset="309193">I am here representing Willie Jasper Darden.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.729" offset="327374">We ask in this case that the court set aside Mr. Darden’s conviction the first-degree murder and his sentence to death cause of gross prosecutorial misconduct during summation.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.490" offset="382440">The court has not heard afore in reviewing the state conviction, a held to the prosecutors closing argument, so far transcended the bounds of legitimacy and decency as to constituted deprivation of a dependence Fourteen Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.383" offset="445970">Nonetheless it did recognize and Justice Rehnquist’s opinion in DeCristoforo, that prosecution is remarks to the jury, may so infect to trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.585" offset="506783">Moreover, it is ruled in many other contexts that circumstances of a criminal trial or other sorts of misconduct during it.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.433" offset="542205">A may so impair the fundamental integrity of the jury’s determination and deliberations as to constituted denial of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.289" offset="585673">We ask therefore in this case that the court apply settle doctrine to vacate a conviction and a jury recommended death sentence infected by willful righteous prosecutorial misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.112" offset="648889">As we see it, if ever a prosecutor’s misconduct in summation can constitute a denial of a fair trial this is such case.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.384" offset="698000">I would like first to focus a little bit on the evidence because it is crucial here, it is crucial if the court understand that this was not a case in which the evidence was overwhelming, this was a case in which the jury might rationally and reasonably go either way at the end of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.316" offset="773755">We think the case was doubtful, we think that the evidence plainly shows that not withstanding the respondents used to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.530" offset="814610">Now what was the evidence here?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="180.746" offset="823492">What stage of the argument was the challenger objection made for the argument?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="geoffrey_m_kalmus" startTime="187.668" stopTime="712.056">
            <label>Mr. Geoffrey M. Kalmus</label>
            <text syncTime="187.668" offset="851182">Your honor there was only one objection taken in the course of the prosecutor McDaniel’s argument and that was rather far along in it and at that point defense counsel stood up and objected to one of McDaniel’s statements that he wished the defendant had been maimed, that his head has been blown off or he had been cut his own throat of which there were a good many such statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.940" offset="960269">That was the only objection taken the trial judge simply without any discussion said overruled, proceed Mr. McDaniel.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.498" offset="1026516">Returning to the question of the evidence as it stood at the close of the defense case, there were only three significant items of evidence supporting the prosecutions claimed that Mr. Darden had committed this robbery murder of the man name Terman.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.795" offset="1115645">Two of the items of evidence were identifications, those by Mrs. Terman who was working in the furniture store when the assailant came in and that of a young man name Mr. Arnold the 16 year old boy who kind of happened in the backdoor while the crime was in progress and was also shot and injured by the assailant.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.021" offset="1220553">Both of those identifications were shortly challenged at the trial, and both of them I think would put insubstantial doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.330" offset="1261827">That subject was one in which we dealt at lenghts in our brief because at the time we submitted our brief the identification issue was also one upon which the court had granted cert, I may recall that in early January, so it was limited to the first question presented that at the prosecutorial misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.937" offset="1344269">One can judge Mrs. Terman’s identification of the assailant in a few fashions.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.000" offset="1372481">Number one, she gave a description to the Deputy Sherif right after the crime that bore no resemblance to the petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.914" offset="1404142">Number two, she described the assailant is wearing clothing that different markedly from that what petitioner was described is wearing by somebody who had seen him at the seen him scene of his automobile accident which according to the prosecution happened as he was fleeing the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.166" offset="1477180">Number three, Mrs. Terman never was asked to or in fact identify the petitioner of any kind of a formal line up be it photo or live.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.404" offset="1518140">Number four, her only pretrial identification in this came into evidence on the direct testimony at trial occurred at the preliminary hearing when the petitioner was the only black man in the court room seated with counsel of the defense table and was -- Mrs. Thurman was asked to point him out and she did and one can judge the reliability of that identification by what she said when she was asked by the court in effect are you sure?</text>
            <text syncTime="384.275" offset="1637572">And she responded why when I walked into the court room and was seated in the back and I saw him from the rear I knew this was the man who had killed my husband, this was somebody she had seen for a few minutes during the robbery and she claimed of knowing him since she walked in from his back.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.173" offset="1705177">Mr. Arnold’s identification, this is the 16 year old boy, he was subject to substantial infirmity as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.616" offset="1738927">First of all he testified a trial that he had seen the assailant for only 20 to 25 seconds and in part of that time he was looking down at Mr. Terman who had been shot and laid in the doorway and was trying to give aid to him.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.097" offset="1800889">Number two, he said his mind went blank during that 20-25 seconds.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.472" offset="1818339">Number three, he was never, the subject of a lying up be it photo or otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.990" offset="1844462">He did while in the hospital identify the petitioner’s photo in the group shown to him but his testimony was at the trial that four or the six photos shown to him which looked nothing like the petitioner and that the one that he did see and identify lo and behold petitioner’s name across it Darden across the chest and the date 09/09/73 of the date of the crime, and Mr. Arnold testified that he had read about the crime before he was asked to make this photo identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.727" offset="1995345">The final piece of evidence that the state had that amounted to anything was a gun and the gun was indisputably of the caliber used in the crime a 38 and it was found some 40 feet from the highway and a roughly the same distance from the place at which the petitioner had his automobile accident, no dispute that he had the accident a few miles from the scene of the crime at around the same time and that gun was found a day later, not very far from the automobile accident and not very far from the highway and indeed there was no dispute that anybody might tossed it out passing the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.227" offset="2157409">So, that was the states case as the case went to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.553" offset="2174649">On the defendant side the defendant had taken the stand in his own behalf, he was the only witness in his own behalf.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.857" offset="2195861">He had told what I believe the record demonstrates to be a coherent and plausible story not in consistent with the prosecution story but to the identifications, not in itself inherently and implausible story and that was the case for the defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.635" offset="2291051">So, in sum the case as it reached the summations stage was a close one and we think the prosecution summation itself impart demonstrates that.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.403" offset="2342042">I think one can ask rhetorical question quite appropriately, would any sensible prosecutor have carried on when McDaniel did hear if he though he had an easy winner.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.853" offset="2387913">Is this the kind of thing that any experience and this was not experience prosecutor would do, if he was comfortable with his case and we think the answer to that is an obvious one and did McDaniel’s conduct itself demonstrates that he thought his case was shaky one.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.027" offset="2460534">As to the merits of the summation the demerits of the summation, the character of the McDaniel’s conduct I do not think the one need past beyond the brief of the respondent and the opinion of the Supreme Court of Florida to know how it should be characterized.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.706" offset="2531273">The respondent’s brief what is it called the summation by McDaniel here.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.486" offset="2550395">Utterly irrelevant is one phrase, without rational relationships that question of quilt or innocence is a second, inflammatory and irrelevancy state says, improper appeals to the jury’s emotion.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.459" offset="2606297">Finally, the ravings of the prosecution that is the state’s characterization, not ours of the summation by McDaniel.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.204" offset="2653317">I think if you read the state’s brief, it is only real argument in the defense of the summation depart from the procedural points that has raised is that the summation was so bad that no sensible juries would have paid any attention to anything that McDaniel said.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.947" offset="2724266">Now the majority in the Supreme Court of Florida this was the conviction and death sentence were affirmed by 5-to-2.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.118" offset="2752896">The majority opinion also recognized we think that the closing argument was not improper one.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.615" offset="2778914">What have they said?</text>
            <text syncTime="671.273" offset="2785601">They said although the prosecutions remarks under ordinary circumstances would constitute a violation of the code of professional responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.623" offset="2818934">In this particular case they amounted to harmless era when the totality of the record is considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.888" offset="2844011">Again the language used by the prosecution Justice Boyd wrote for the majority would possibly have been reversal error if it had been used regarding a less heinous set of crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.559" offset="2898659">Illogically however the Supreme Court of Florida said this crime was such a shocking one that all of this inflammatory irrelevant nonsense was proper.</text>

            <text syncTime="987.876" offset="4052018">If one can get a sense of it from just a few quotations from one of McDaniel’s themes, it is the one that he began with, it is one that he ended with and it is threaded throughout his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.376" offset="4097993">As far as I am concerned he said, there should be another defendant in this court room that is the division of corrections, the prisons, that had let him out on a weekend for a while, that was the reason the issue came up.</text>

            <text syncTime="1108.669" offset="4535178">Again if one looks at some of these other themes, he talks about the defendant and his McDaniel’s wish that the defendant had been maimed or killed or shot themselves, or blown his head off over and over again he comes back to that theme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.321" offset="4605709">Obviously for no purpose then to rouse up the jury to get them to decide this case without regard to the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.599" offset="4642907">Again there is the theme of putting the prosecutor’s credibility itself in issue, something that every court for long, long many, many years has condemned and yet it was done here over and over again by the prosecution, both by prosecutor’s wife and by prosecutor McDaniel saying, I know sure as I am standing here that this man is guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.663" offset="4755129">McDaniel again saying, why if I were in the petitioner shoes I would have lied like till my teeth out also, remarked over and over again of that kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.911" offset="4812076">I think one can fairly conclude only that the prosecution’s misconduct was willful the state does not dispute that, and I think that is one of the key reasons here why there must be a reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.945" offset="4876233">I would like to turn to some comparison of this situation with that in DeCristoforo in which Mr. Justice Rehnquist said a number of guidelines for dealing with this kind of an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.244" offset="4937464">Before I do that I would like to ask whether there are any questions that the court would like to put with respect to the procedural points that the state has raised and what we have dealt in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.272" offset="4993575">Turning to the merits than and the comparison with DeCristoforo, there were I think three criteria that the Court thought crucial in DeCristoforo, crucial there in finding that there was no denial of due process through with the prosecutors statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.297" offset="5085631">There you will remember what court was concerned with was a one sentence rather ambiguous mark that according to the First Circuit at least the majority in the First Circuit had indicated to the jury perhaps that the defendant had sought to plead guilty to some lesser crime in first-degree murder and the prosecution had turned him down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.619" offset="5202973">So, it was semi-implication of guilt and it was a single sentence which this court found rather uncertain and ambiguous in its meaning and of little probable impact in the context of the entire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.969" offset="5268383">Three criteria that Mr. Justice Rehnquist spoke about, one was how larger role did the prosecutor's misconduct if one may call that in DeCristoforo occupy and in the context to the whole summation indeed in the context of the trial and the answer there was it was one sentence out of what the court characterizes a lengthy summation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.141" offset="5369007">Here one has the 35 type written pages of summation by prosecutor McDaniel and I had try to measure it and I think you come down around 10-12 pages if you cut out the you irrelevancies, the ravings, the carryings on about all crimes and murders that had nothing to do with the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.801" offset="5471720">Secondly, Mr. Justice Rehnquist focused in DeCristoforo, on whether the prosecution’s conduct was willful or was it a mistaken in the heat of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1355.042" offset="5520622">There it was fair to infer from the fact that a single sentence was involved and the judges in the Massachusetts Supreme Court, Federal District Court, the Courts of Appeals and here all disagreed about what that one sentence probably conveyed to the jury, it was fair that conclude that misstatement was accidental or just poor phrasing by the prosecutor in the context of something that came out without prior planning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.736" offset="5631381">Our case no doubt about it, the state does not contest it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.482" offset="5650398">This was a calculated willful effort to rouse up to jury to distract them from the evidence to tell them that what I am telling you Mr. McDaniel was saying is relevant to your consideration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1400.975" offset="5704419">You do not mean that in its full sweep what you just said that, supposing the prosecutor in the midst of a 30 minutes summary goes off on a 10 minute total irrelevancy about how the weather is been in the last few days, but it’s not at all prejudicial to the defendant, do not you have to combine the two to make your argument.</text>

            <text syncTime="1424.386" offset="5798042">I agree Mr. Justice Rehnquist that if it had been of such palpable irrelevancy as what a nice weather we have been having, then one would say without any hesitation that maybe prosecutor is little crazy, but it had nothing to do with the case and the juries could not have been move by it or rational juries would not have been move by it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.055" offset="5884664">Our case does not fit that mould at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.893" offset="5900024">The comments, the many, many comments that McDaniel were not off to one side, they were cut through from the beginning to the end, number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.343" offset="5933879">Number two, that they were not of such of palpable irrelevance that sensible juries unsophisticated but people of average intelligence would say, gee obviously that has got nothing to do with this case, I am going to disregard it, they would not say that to themselves about the kinds of things McDaniel was going on about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.674" offset="6019143">They would say, as this court said way back in Berger v. United States, Justice Sutherland’s opinion that the prosecutor comes here with not merely official backing, but presumably to do justice and therefore I think juries would say themselves, we can take it, the things that he says have some relevance to our consideration of this man guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.375" offset="6117990">I think that if you read these remarks in context, one must suppose, one can avoid supposing that any average group of juries would have so understood the remarks and would have taken them into account in deciding whatever they decide.</text>

            <text syncTime="1561.157" offset="6345151">I think when the prosecutor willfully departed into matters that were obviously not evidence, were not related to the evidence.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard W. Prospect</label>
            <text syncTime="1619.390" offset="6578058">Mr. Chief Justice it may please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.293" offset="6589657">My name is Richard Prospect and I am appearing here on behalf of the respondent State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.624" offset="6614943">I have just sat here for the last 15 minutes and listened to the number of times with which Mr. Kalmus has attributed the state, the respondent is caused with admitting, conceiving and otherwise not contesting the fact that the statements that appear in this record that were arguing the closing argument of the state’s case are irrelevant, outrageous, ridiculous and otherwise having no place in any trial in our state or any other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.058" offset="6744720">I replied to him by saying what else could I do, the statements are there, I am not about to tell the court that they are not, I am not about to tell the court that it means something other than the plain meaning of their words are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.240" offset="6789441">My question is or my position is, of those portions other remarks that absolutely are irrelevant to any business at hand there is nothing that ca not be said except were they prejudicial to this defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.694" offset="6851299">The other portions that were more or less listed in the petitioners dissection of the argument are at least in part in response to certain things that the jury heard first by defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.781" offset="6907619">Now the mention about, the only way I know this man is not going to get back out on the public is to sentence him to death.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.537" offset="6950669">Now, that came in response to something defense counsel started off in the first argument the jury heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.256" offset="6977523">If you will read that you will find that, Mr. Maloney the first defense counsel stated that ladies and gentlemen on the evidence the state has presented today, they are asking you to kill my client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.864" offset="7031962">Now, McDaniel quickly corrected that misimpression, he very clearly and substantially told the jury that ladies and gentlemen we are not here to do that right now, we are here to determine guilt or innocence and nothing else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.705" offset="7083267">We have a second stage of the proceeding in which I will ask for the death penalty and I'm going to ask for it because it is the only way I know to keep this man off the street.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.716" offset="7123391">Now that is something that we can justify because it is not response to what occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.784" offset="7139587">The other matter – let us not nitpick over any of them, let’s not reread them or anything else, I know they are there, you know they are there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.079" offset="7168739">Let us decide whether they deprive this man of a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.388" offset="7185980">Now, anybody and probably everybody who is familiar with his record will quickly agree that these arguments had no place there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.416" offset="7226104">Everybody except defense counsel, it is not until the last page, as it appears in the appendix, does that objection occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.336" offset="7269781">Why is this, they were either asleep, they did not think anything was wrong with the remarks or and I believe this comes into the rationale of the Estelle and Francis case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.057" offset="7320667">They thought perhaps we just got reversible error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.970" offset="7336341">Does it take a legal wizard to see there or to sit there and to listen to man take off and in a rent and know that something is not right.</text>

            <text syncTime="2549.765" offset="10299567">But if they are not then, they can be rehabilitated by what counsel said in his response in his rebutting closing argument or he repeated, listen ladies and gentlemen only to the evidence forget this wild man over here, we are not here to do anything by decide guilt or innocence and we of course concluded our discussion of the jury with based on this profile.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.872" offset="10403952">Now this is just only reflects the questions and answers which would indicate where the people and from and what they do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.046" offset="10432687">Now this doesn’t reflect their responses to other questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2586.166" offset="10445121">Standard jury questions which are asked in all cases relative to predisposition to guilt innocence, notoriety of the case and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.319" offset="10481797">You will see some very intelligent answers especially those relating to Weatherspoon, you will see some very intelligent people.</text>
            <text syncTime="2603.629" offset="10515025">We submit that these people were sophisticated enough to know that when McDaniel took off that is all he was doing, taking off and it was perhaps – they viewed him with legal egg on his face, if that’s possible phrase to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.192" offset="10577196">We just don’t think that they were persuaded to rush to judgment, put that verdict as guilty and comeback out and say, we were based on our or being inflamed, we reacted from our heart and not our head.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.735" offset="10631427">I just do not believe that, and I have got an idea that they did not believe it either or else they would have objected and they would have at least gotten up there and said, Your Honor would you please tell this man or I object on the grounds of this, let us stop it, but perhaps they did try to take a shot of the verdict knowing that they have reversible error because you got to remember is not it always good if you are on the defense side to get a new trial especially in a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2660.017" offset="10740514">Now if they were convinced of reversible error they know they have got to go Florida Supreme Court, that court hears was capital cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.563" offset="10774682">It takes time; we conceivably could have had a reversal occur, have to try this man within five years or more from the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2676.774" offset="10807596">The second trial is always fine, where you got the possibility of missing witnesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.941" offset="10824210">You have always got the possibility of even with available witnesses dimming memories and every witness you have got against you, you can automatically ask, you mean to tell me you can remember something that clearly that happens four or five or six years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.811" offset="10887740">It is a good shot to try and get that reversal in the second trial and it is even better shot to try for the acquital because then you can go home that day and I think that the issue involved here considering the lack of objection, considering the very thing, they are yelling about the most, the content of the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.653" offset="10971123">Consider all of that and in light of the entire record and I think you really have to conclude that all though McDaniel – even I represent the state, I feel like I am representing one man and his conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.632" offset="11030996">Even though he heard himself, and but not the case, I think you have got to say that, viewed in his totality Willie Jasper Darden may not received a perfect trial, not the antiseptic one and Darden merely as, as you suggested Mr. Chief Justice dispassionately read something or summarize the evidence but he got a fair one and that is what we are here about.</text>

            <text syncTime="2755.416" offset="11122111">If in Florida one makes an objection to the trial judge on the particular ground and the trial overrules the objection, is it generally presumed that if another similar instance arises, the lawyer is not required to make the objection again that the trial judges ruling would be the same on a subsequent case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2775.432" offset="11202254">Yes sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.475" offset="11206329">As a matter of fact I believe we have case law to the effect that once you know it would be useless in light of previous ruling, you don’t have to do it, it still preserved properly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.852" offset="11243841">But using that I will still ask for one objection in this record which is not there.</text>

            <text syncTime="2797.016" offset="11288563">if I may, just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.876" offset="11307998">I think that what the state is asking here is the prosecutor be given license to proceed willingly and whatever fashion he may, and on whatever ground he may wish to, and to put the defendants counsel in the box of standing up and objecting every time something you said, or if letting it go by.</text>
            <text syncTime="2831.603" offset="11426907">We all know that, that is a difficult lawyer’s decision to make in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.531" offset="11458568">Like here the state is saying, even though the prosecutor willfully makes outrageous arguments that he has no business making and he knows he has no business making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.295" offset="11513634">Still the defense coun is going to be kept in that box and that seems to us that’s not a tactical choice that can fairly be imposed against willful misconduct by prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.989" offset="11580403">As to your question Mr. Justice Marshall as to why there was no in effect to the systems of counsel issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.920" offset="11608197">The issue was not raised in the courts below and we did not feel that could be raised here for the first time, perhaps it is raised upon habeas I do not know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.584" offset="11642783">Although I know that from past experience it is a very difficult one to win.</text>
