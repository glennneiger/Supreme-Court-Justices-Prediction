            <label>Mr. Irving Galt</label>
            <text syncTime="10.327" offset="141833">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="14.189" offset="157298">In continuing, I should like to stress why the grant of use immunity to Mr. Cunningham would be totally unacceptable to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.821" offset="207767">They would undoubtedly view it as a situation simply of two politicians conspiring together for the purpose of having one of them confer immunity upon the other in exchange for an agreement to confess.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.518" offset="278611">This of course would heighten public suspicion and distrust of politicians in general, and the very idea that a party officer can only be compelled to account for his performance in office, only on the condition that he will be forever insulated from prosecution for his misdeeds is repellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.195" offset="397311">It is repugnant to any concept of justice and I think an outrage, which the constitution could never have intended nor condone, and I think New York should certainly be permitted to convince its citizens that they can control the political process and that they need not let politicians go scot free simply in return for the truth as to the exercise of the public trust imposed in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.974" offset="532416">Now, in this case certainly, Mr. Cunningham losses no employment, looses no right to continue in his professional practice, should he relinquish his party offices and in this sense there is a very significant distinction from the Garrity line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.017" offset="620606">In each of which, there was substantial economic reprisal as the price for the exercise of the Fifth Amendment privilege and it makes this case I think much more closely resemble the fairly recent decision of this court, last April I believe in Baxter against Palmigiano where it was said by this court that a negative affect without substantial economic penalty is not or rather is a consequence constitutionally permissible under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.882" offset="808060">And there is another very sharp difference among many others from the Garrity line of cases, there is no doubt whatever that Mr. Cunningham and his state and county chairmanships were not all very conspicuous, very visible, highly visible, and very easily identifiable in the public eye, a fact which was not present in any of the Garrity line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.798" offset="915685">Now, I know that this court has recognized that the Fifth Amendment is intended to protect the innocent as well as the guilty and also that the invoking of the privilege does not promote, but rather tends to detract from the truth finding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.292" offset="1013696">And in these circumstances one may well ask what then of the innocent party officer, the really innocent party officer, who feels impelled or feels the necessity for exercising his Fifth Amendment privilege because of the possibility of the coincidence, mistake or something else which in his particular situation might lead to mistaken prosecution and conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.243" offset="1121530">Should his personal interest and his fears of the mistaken prosecution or conviction outweigh the public interest in procuring and accounting of what he did and what he is doing in his party office and to evaluate the integrity of the party officer, his office, and his party?</text>
            <text syncTime="278.571" offset="1214839">I think the answer certainly must be no, because only he, the party officer is in a position himself to judge the likelihood of the possibility of a mistaken conviction and?</text>

            <text syncTime="299.946" offset="1300312">There were two indictments that were dismissed from which the new special prosecutor is appealing which occurred subsequent to the writing of the briefs and I believe there is at least one and possibly two other indictments still pending against Mr. Cunningham.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.619" offset="1370947">That is the best of my knowledge.</text>

            <label>Mr. Irving Galt</label>
            <text syncTime="333.104" offset="1432909">No I do not think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.229" offset="1437402">In the first place, the party offices with the exception of the state chairmanship which he voluntarily relinquished as I explained yesterday about a month ago, he still holds.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.526" offset="1482647">In the second place our statute has been stricken down and the situation is very much in the public eye and in the public mind in New York and of course there is though very great likelihood of recurrence of such situation at some future time, but from every standpoint and in every way I sincerely submit that there is nothing at all moot about this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.931" offset="1576269">And too, if I may continue Mr. Chief Justice, I would simply say that I had suggested that a no was the only answer to the questions I had hypothetically posed and I was pointing out that only he could judge the likelihood of a mistaken conviction and it is perfectly reasonable to have a statute like Section 22, which has the effect of discouraging him from making the choice of exercising the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.822" offset="1715763">And I think it is clear that the State's paramount interest, its very strong interest in maintaining, its very compelling interest in maintaining the integrity of its political system, entitles it to insist that a party officer yield his office in a very special situation such as I conjured up a few moments ago, in order to assure that his concern over his personal faith will not transcend the need to prevent putting a cloud over his party, over his office, and indeed over himself in the public mind and over the political system too.</text>

            <text syncTime="896.785" offset="3687695">At page 27 of the appellant's appendix, it is clear that party office includes the right to be a delegate to the democratic convention that is in the rules of the Democratic Party.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.129" offset="3737014">At page 35, Section 5 of that Section, it is clear that party office may also include membership in the Democratic National Committee because New York's representatives on the Democratic National Committee, including Mr. Cunningham, are selected by the State Democratic Committee.</text>

Turley in the 1973 term, involving persons with whom the state was contracting, who would also be disqualified from contracting with the state if they invoked the privilege against self-incrimination or as Mr. Justice Stewart aptly points out, refuse to execute the waiver of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.381" offset="4014016">The teaching of the court has been consistent and clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.474" offset="4030421">All members of the Court conquered in the judgment in the judgment in Gardner and Sanitation Men and Mr. Justice White's opinion in Lefkowitz v. Turley was an opinion for all members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="993.865" offset="4075979">Recognizing that the state can compel an accounting by holders of a public trust if it simply takes measures to grant use immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.709" offset="4131358">The question today, therefore, is whether those cases spoke with an uncertain sound or paltered in a double sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1014.443" offset="4158317">The three judge court did not take a great deal of time in concluding that they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.240" offset="4181513">And the appellant argues differently of what it is seems to us is three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.615" offset="4218921">Now the appellant claims that it is alright to strip a party officer of the post to which he was elected by the suffrage of his fellow party members and that this intrusion into Voluntary Political Association is permissible and that this can be done for the sole and single reason of a refusal to execute a waiver of immunity before a grand jury or the invocation of a constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, again, before a grand jury meeting in secret and that further, the punishment of a 5-year disqualification from public or party office may likewise be exacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.302" offset="4373670">The first claim is if the court please, that the state somehow possesses a different interest in the political process then it possesses when considering the fidelity to their trust of employees such as policeman and sanitation men and persons with whom the state does business such as contractors and architects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.614" offset="4454963">The argument if the court please, cuts the other way.</text>

            <text syncTime="2181.227" offset="8825458">This court in the Greenwald case dealing with the situation of petitioner 26.27 explored the reasons why someone might want to take the privilege against self-incrimination.</text>

            <text syncTime="2202.400" offset="8910095">A motion to quash was made on Mr. Cunningham's behalf that challenged vigorously the good faith underlying the service of this process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.274" offset="8937576">This was responded to by the former special prosecutor and affidavit that condemned Mr. Cunningham in sweeping terms as a central figure in widespread criminality affecting nominations for judicial and other offices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.649" offset="8983133">Basic fairness requires it to be said explicitly, is indisputably established by the record of these grand jury proceedings that this charge was not justified by the evidence then at his disposal and was not substantiated by the investigation that followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.978" offset="9044469">That which is a judgment of the court of record of the State of New York, I think puts this matter in context and demonstrates really quite, we think this case is as important as we believe it to be, that is any district attorney in New York state in any county can hail someone before the Grand Jury under these circumstances and cause a forfeiture of party office by the tactics here used.</text>
