            <label>Mr. Philip S. Olinger</label>
            <text syncTime="50.274" offset="301586">Mr. Chief Justice, and May it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.272" offset="325619">The Mt. Healthy School District is a small school district on the outskirts of Cincinnati.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.992" offset="348502">It has approximately, 7600 students and approximately 325 teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.062" offset="372744">In 1966, the Board of Education employed Fred Doyle, the respondent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.499" offset="402524">He was employed on three one-year contracts and then he was given a two-year contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.892" offset="428019">All of these contracts were nontenure.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.116" offset="444946">In 1971, in the spring of that year, the Board, as was its usual custom, reviewed the contracts of the nontenured teachers, and determined that year, that ten of them should not be renewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.159" offset="501162">Mr. Doyle happened to be one of those teachers whose contract was not renewed.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.493" offset="518507">He requested a reason following his notice that he was not renewed and the superintendent sent him a letter and in that letter the superintendent stated, that “he was not renewed because it was felt he lacked tact in handling professional matters” and the superintendent went on to cite two examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.341" offset="605861">One was a telephone call that Mr. Doyle had made to a local disc jockey at a radio station to criticize a dress code that had been sent around to the teachers and the second example cited by the superintendent was an obscene gesture that Mr. Doyle had made to some female students in the school.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.116" offset="696976">After Mr. Doyle was aware that he was not going to be renewed in Mt. Healthy, he sought employment elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.183" offset="725188">In fact in June of 1971, obtained a job at the Miami Trace Local School District, which is 50 miles or so North of Mt. Healthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.809" offset="767715">One month later in July, he filed this suit along with two other school teachers and he filed the suit against the five board members in their individual and official capacity, he filed it against the Board itself as a political entity of a state, and he filed it against the superintendent.</text>

            <text syncTime="185.125" offset="840963">Let me ask you question there if I may Mr. Olinger and I will try to be parochial, but I am used to the Arizona Organization of School, first let me give you that and ask you if it is like Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.911" offset="896133">Where I practice in Arizona, there was a municipal corporation which was called a School District and it was very much analogous to counties or cities and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.737" offset="939392">Then the Board that administered that district was called the School Board it was not a sueable entity in itself, it was just a collection of individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.657" offset="983173">Now what is the situation in Ohio?</text>

            <label>Mr. Philip S. Olinger</label>
            <text syncTime="223.072" offset="992786">In Ohio, Your Honor, there are different types of school districts, but the particular district we are discussing here is a, what is known as a city school district and basically it encompasses the district or the same boundary lines as the municipality of Mt. Healthy.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.619" offset="1086932">Now, however, in Ohio school districts that are city school districts do not have to be confined to that precise municipal boundary, and I think you will find for example with the Mt. Healthy School District it encompassed a larger amount of territory than the city itself, part of a township, and the same would be true for example with the Board of Education for the City of Cincinnati which encompasses the city of Cincinnati.</text>

            <text syncTime="608.460" offset="2534324">I might say one another thing, Your Honor, these percentages of state contribution would have been higher except that in Ohio, the State of Ohio was finding itself in a very financially embarrassed position and has reduced the amount of equal yield of all the School Districts in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.158" offset="2625126">After conclusion of the trial, the District Court dismissed the board members and the superintendent and found that the board was guilty and should pay to Mr. Doyle something over $5000 in wages, should pay something over $6000 attorney fees, assessed costs against the board and ordered Mr. Doyle to be reinstated in the Mt. Healthy School System on a tenured contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.764" offset="2775591">On appeal, the only thing that Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals did was to reverse the District Court in so for as attorney fees on the basis of the Alyeska versus Wilderness Society holding that attorney fees are basically cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.391" offset="2838076">The evidence, I think establishes beyond doubt that Mr. Doyle’s contract was not be renewed because the board members felt that he simply lack the tact or for an use of another word, maturity to be given a tenured contract in the Board of Education.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.132" offset="2937028">The court in its opinion cites five examples, if you will, of Mr. Doyle’s immaturity and as one board member said over the five years, there appeared to be no improvement in his maturity or lack of tact problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.242" offset="3013515">Now, in fact, I think perhaps the most important thing that I can find in the judge’s opinion was when he states, “in fact", as this Court sees that and finds both the board and the superintendent basically had ample reason not to grant Mr. Doyle a tenured contract without regard to the First Amendment problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.987" offset="3124483">The Court also pointed out that four board members and the superintendent stated without any denial or rebuttal that they did not determine not to renew Mr. Doyle’s contract because of a free speech problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="828.074" offset="3412770">There is some argument, alright, the board did not consider that, but I am going to treat the matter as though the board and which they did, they were certainly well aware of the WSAI phone call.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.494" offset="3458432">My position is that I think as Judge Hogan who I an very fond of, looked at the case, he saw that the board had valid reasons not to renew the contract, but he saw the telephone call to WSAI and he felt under Pickering and as he cites ski him that he had no choice, but since there was a First Amendment problem in there that he had to rule against the board.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.476" offset="6858426">After that constitutional amendment was passed, the issue immediately arouse whether or not the State of Ohio had abolished its sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.500" offset="6906491">After numerous cases, particularly involving municipalities, the Supreme Court of Ohio said, well, based on Hans versus Louisiana, based on cases in other jurisdictions, we do not think that that provision of the constitution is self executed that there must be a legislation enacted to carry out that permission that has been granted by that constitutional amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1743.255" offset="7073466">Now, in the case of Aldrich versus the City of Youngstown, which was decided in 1922, as I said, it became clear that if the sovereign immunity of State of Ohio was to be abolished, it had to be abolished by specific provision of the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.382" offset="7154027">Now, trying to apply that theory to the Fourteenth Amendment theory and the First Amendment theory, first of all if I understand the problem, under 1983, it provides a remedy and a method to carry out the civil rights provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.113" offset="7232917">Now, the First Amendment, as I understand it, only provides that there shall be no violation of the right to freedom of speech, but it does not provide a remedy etcetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.486" offset="7294461">Now, under the Fourteenth Amendment, if I understand correctly, and this is where I maybe wrong, the Fourteenth Amendment, under Section 5, provides that the Fourteenth Amendment will be implemented or required to be implemented by a legislation passed by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.026" offset="7376590">Now, the problem I have is, I presume that that language in this Fourteenth Amendment has to apply to the First Amendment because if I understand correctly, the first state amendments apply to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment and that therefore to carry out the First Amendment, there also has to be some sort of a congressional legislation in order to carry out the provisions of the First Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2649.375" offset="10698008">But I think we have to recall the chronology here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2652.752" offset="10711487">When the Fourteenth Amendment was passed or enacted in the late 1860s, there was no federal question jurisdiction in the Federal Courts and so Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment of necessity had to say, as it did say, the Congress will enact such legislation as will be necessary to provide for the enforcement of this Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.965" offset="10788391">That was necessary because the whole predicate of the Amendment was there ought to be a Federal cause of action and there was no federal jurisdiction to enforce it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.622" offset="10819007">Now, Congress’ first response to that, to Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment was the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 which contain what are both now 1983 and 1343.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.359" offset="10869893">The cause of action and the jurisdictional provision were enacted together to provide a cause of action for damages under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2703.147" offset="10913048">Now at that time in 1871, Congress taking its first tentative step in this area made the judgment not to permit suits against Municipality so at least so this Court held in Monroe v. Pape, there are many commentators you think that is a misreading of the legislative history, but we would accept that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2722.309" offset="10989743">We are obviously bound by Monroe v. Pape.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.382" offset="11002073">In 1971, Congress said, we do not want to create this cause of action against the Municipality itself, but only against the officials and if that is where things stood, there would no predicate for bringing a suit in Federal Court against the Municipality.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.856" offset="11071872">But four years later, Congress enacted 1331.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.606" offset="11086919">At that time it expressed none of the cautions that it had expressed in 1871, indeed as this Court has repeatedly commented in discussing 1331, its intention was with certain very specific exceptions to invest the federal courts with the entire body of federal question jurisdiction which constitutionally could be invested in them.</text>

            <text syncTime="2809.237" offset="11337485">Now, the Court in Bell v. Hood said there are a lot of questions the Court has going to have to decide on the merits.</text>

Hood it was not a jurisdictional question, but a merits question which was not raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="3041.763" offset="12267549">Now, I guess -- it never occurred to me until Your Honor asked the question, but obviously for the same reason, the answer is no, it is not jurisdiction, although jurisdiction does depend on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.232" offset="12309449">That is to say, if I allege a cause of action under 1983 saying that a school board is a person, that is a merits question, is there such a cause of action and yet jurisdiction, I guess the mere allegation of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.918" offset="12376218">If in the same way that Bell v.

            <text syncTime="3621.836" offset="14587849">Now our view is that guidance is provided in a number of areas of what should you do when you have a mixed improper decision which is that you put the burden on the wrong doer, as Judge Leonard Han (ph) said in a very similar in NLRB case to disentangle the consequences for which he is chargeable, from those from which he is immune from responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.556" offset="14678755">It is his burden to persuade the trial effect that even without this incident he would have reached the same decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.248" offset="14705505">This court apply that same standard under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, last year in Franks versus Bowmen Transportation saying that where race was a factor in a employer’s decision to deny employment to somebody that does not mean that he might not have denied employment to him anyway, but the burden is going to be on the employer to show that would have reached the same decision even if race had not been a factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3674.635" offset="14799023">Now, these have all been statutory causes of action, where the violation of the statutory right shifted the burden to the defendant, and we submit that the rule surely must be at least the same, when it is a violation of one’s constitutional right which has created this mixed motive dilemma that the burden must be on the defendant and as we explain in our brief, there was no evidence introduced in this case from which the Court could have find and indeed the Court did not find that the defendant met that burden.</text>

            <text syncTime="3714.037" offset="14956594">So far as future conduct when future behavior on the part of school boards around the country would be almost meaningless or else they would put them in terribly bad trap because let us assume in that if we decide the case in your favor, thereafter would it not be true that any incompetent teacher who knew that because of his incompetence or misconduct or bad behavior he was not going to be rehired could simply go out and make a speech, a very insulting speech against the school board and if that or any part of their decision not to rehire him, then he would have to be rehired despite his misconduct and incompetence on the one hand, and would it not mean on the other hand that if we decide it in your favor that any school board that could read or whose lawyer could read would know that when they failed to rehire a candidate, a teacher, all they had to do is not mention this speech and then they could fail to rehire him, so are we not just talking about meaningless words?</text>

            <text syncTime="3797.948" offset="15292319">The labor board has been adjudicating for four decades in which the parties knew that a mixed motive termination led to what Judge Leonard Han said it led to it, disentangling of the consequences and the remedy dependent on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="3816.576" offset="15366821">Of course the school board never rarely say as this one so candidly did, we relied on this and yet you can find from other evidence on occasions that they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.583" offset="15402870">You can find that the disparate treatment for example, ten people did the other things they are lying on, the only difference is this teacher made a speech and how would he goes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3837.138" offset="15449054">The other side of the coin is to us more troublesome which is if we do not have a burden on the defendant in the mixed motive cases, every school board that wants to fire a defendant for a First Amendment reason, well, simply no teacher can teach for five years without having done something that somebody could find objectionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3853.844" offset="15515823">Even though their motivation is solely the First Amendment reason, they will just tack on to two or three other incidents that are just.</text>
