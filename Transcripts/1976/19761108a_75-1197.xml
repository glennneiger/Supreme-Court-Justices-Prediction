            <text syncTime="48.904" offset="296135">Thank you Mr. Chief Justice, may I please the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.650" offset="311077">In separate enactments, over the period from 1939-1958, Congress has gradually expanded the social security entitlements of wage earner’s wives.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.329" offset="353813">So that as of 1958, the wife of a wage earner with an entitled child in her care, may obtain benefits without regard or age when the wage earner becomes entitled to primary benefits on his own account.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.488" offset="418388">Also overtime, though for quite different reasons, Congress has expanded and it is extended secondary benefits to certain categories of divorced wives, including a provision that is involved in this case in 1965, that divorced wives defined as those who were married to their husbands for a period of 20 years or more prior to the divorce, are entitled to secondary benefits at the time that the wage earner becomes entitled to primary benefits, provided that they have reached age 62.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.998" offset="548478">So that prior to age 62 wives but not divorced wives, are entitled to receive secondary benefits on the basis of entitled children in their care.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="125.260" offset="601559">Any possibility under those regulations that a wife could collect benefits from more than one husband, or wife or a former wife?</text>

            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="136.290" offset="645653">I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.843" offset="655893">At least, should that be fairly all, she would have been married to two of them for a period of 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.454" offset="690270">As I read the legislative history that was the purpose of that 20 year requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.576" offset="702809">I suppose it would be conceivably possible just as the wives being plus 21 years, results of the possibilities of the fertile octogenarian, but that would be rare.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.610" offset="754950">The appellee in this case, Helen de Castro was divorced from Albert de Castro in February of 1968 after more than 20 years of marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.094" offset="792879">The divorce decree did not award her alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.214" offset="805314">Some three years later, after her ex-husband became eligible for primary benefits, Mrs. de Castro applied for wives benefits on Mr. de Castro’s account.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.465" offset="846378">She was then 56 years old and had in her care, a 22 year old disabled daughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.955" offset="868321">The daughter was entitled to and continues to receive child’s insurance benefits because of Mr. de Castro’s social security earnings record.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.947" offset="904266">At the conclusion of the administrative process, the secretary determined that Mrs. de Castro was not entitled to benefits, she there upon brought suit, contending with Section 202(b)(1)(b) of the act unconstitutionally discriminates against divorced wives.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.191" offset="965288">The Three-Judge Court ruled in her favor and this appeal followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.528" offset="986603">The key to the disposition of this case we submit is contained in two interrelated considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.942" offset="1024220">The first is the history of the statutory provisions in which Congress over a period of some three decades has gradually but continually expanded the Secondary Insurance Benefits available to wives and divorced wives, each with its separate rationale, with a single over arching rationale in the case of wives to benefit the family, but with the subsidiary rationale applicable to most of the individual ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.165" offset="1133098">The second dispositive consideration is the constitutional standard which Congress has held in performing its policy making function of allocating scarce social insurance resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.559" offset="1182731">I would like to address each of these separately.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.325" offset="1189732">First, the history of the relevant statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.729" offset="1203420">The controlling feature of the legislative history is that the secondary benefits to which wives and divorced wives are entitled did not result from a single legislative enactment but rather over a period of some 30 years, Congress has incrementally expanded these benefits with the history of each edition, clearly disclosing a proper objective but in no case that the rationale for the particular enlargement of secondary insurance benefits to the wife equally embraced, the class of divorced wives to which the appellee belongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.218" offset="1353363">When originally enacted in 1935, the Social Security Act provided only primary benefits to the wage earner himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.995" offset="1384501">The first expansion of secondary benefits occurred in 1939, it was a general expansion it had a general purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.882" offset="1416057">That purpose was very clearly set forth in the legislative history and resided by this court as dispositive of the issue in Weinberger v. Weisenfeld and it was to afford more adequate protection to the family as a unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.581" offset="1482826">In addition, on relevant to this case, the 1939 amendments contained the first instance of extension of benefits on an account of an entitled child in the care of either a wife or ex-wife.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.814" offset="1539772">It was a narrow extension, it was made only to widows who had reached either age 65 or had an entitled child in their care.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.612" offset="1582927">Once again, there was a precise rationale for this particular extension in addition to the general family protection that was applicable to the entire package of 1939 secondary benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.637" offset="1630992">Again this was quoted in the Weisenfeld opinion and it was that Congress wanted to give the child deprived of one parent, in this case through death, the opportunity for the person with detention of the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.703" offset="1687312">From 1939-1950, there was no change in the eligibility provisions for wives or widows.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.119" offset="1716987">In 1950, Congress extended the entitled child eligibility to the wife of a retired, whereas prior to that time it had only been diseased, wage earner.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.566" offset="1762754">The rationale was not the same as it was in 1939 because the wife unlike the widow is not faced with the choice of either foregoing income or leaving the child unattended all together because her husband is not dead, but retirement in the usual case means income reduction.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.229" offset="1829418">Extension of this benefit reduced the lead for major adjustments in the family patterns and the normal family relations coming at a time late in the wage earners life.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.041" offset="1872677">Eight years later, in 1958, benefits were extended to the wife of a disabled wage earner with an entitled child in her care.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.929" offset="1912174">So that as of 1958, we have all of the grounds covered, diseased, disabled or retired.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.992" offset="1944461">Once again, the rationale for extension to the disabled, to the wife of a disabled wage earner with an entitled child in her care was tailored to the particular extension, as the house committee report observes the child of a disabled wage earner will usually be younger than the child of a retired wage earner with correspondingly greater need to permit the mother to remain at home, and the house may report further observes that a person receiving disability insurance benefits, frequently has high medical expenses with attendant diminution on the family income.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.654" offset="2107048">Each of these extensions of secondary benefits to wives or widows on account of entitled children in their care was bottomed on a distinct but very proper rationale.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.385" offset="2162009">There is one unifying feature to the three, and it is that each rationale promoted in some way more adequate protection to the family as a unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.498" offset="2218434">Neither this general objective of affording protection to the family as a unit, nor the more precisely identified objectives of the 1939, 1950 and 1958 amendments has any relevance to divorced wives.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.571" offset="2274754">In the normal case, divorce works a fundamental and enduring change not only on family relationships but also on the financial dependents of one divorced spouse on the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.995" offset="2324491">The kinds of impact—</text>

            <text syncTime="562.650" offset="2351031">Well I assume not Mr. Justice White, but it is the kind of thing certainly that under the broad discretion that this court has afforded to Congress in its recent decision is the kind of thing that Congress could have taken into account.</text>

            <text syncTime="583.521" offset="2434519">We certainly know this at a minimum that in 1939, when the initial extension was made that the thing that Congress was attempting to afford more adequate protection for the family as a unit.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.709" offset="2499302">We know that in 1958 they had family internal ongoing family relationships in mind, because of the observation that family income would be reduced because of disability.</text>

            <label>Justice Byron R. White</label>
            <text syncTime="619.790" offset="2579655">On what basis do you say that the Congress determined or that generally it is true that more divorced wives are not dependent?</text>

          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="631.333" stopTime="654.615">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="631.333" offset="2625839">The best figures that we have are those that are set forth in our brief and they indicate that only about 14% of divorced wives are entitled alimony by virtue of the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.759" offset="2683518">And about 45% of those 14% actually receive it so we are down to around 6.5%.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.993" offset="2708491">Significance of that fact of course is this.</text>

            <text syncTime="659.557" offset="2738688">There is nothing in reports, so to indicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="662.476" offset="2750391">But the point is, what you really come down to then is the question of how much leeway do we give to Congress in making these kinds of judgments.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.091" offset="2788843">You do have the problem with the 6.5% of the over inclusiveness or the under inclusiveness, the same kind of problem that this court faced in Salfi, the same kind of problem that this court faced just six months ago in the Lucas case, in Dandridge v. Williams, the court said that Congress is entitled to face these problems one at a time and manifestly, when you have a program that is designed to handle the problems of tens of millions of people with desperate requirements and desperate circumstances, there are going to be some ragged edges, as Mr. Justice Stewart observed in his separate opinion Cramer v. Union Police School District.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.127" offset="2956968">That kind of imperfection is part of the inevitable consequence of line drawing.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.694" offset="2975253">You always have some instances in which Congress does not and indeed cannot exactly tailor its program to avoid any possibility of anomaly or inequity.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.187" offset="3037216">And if there is any message that comes out of Salfi and Lucas, and Dandridge v. Williams, that so long as there is a rationale basis which Congress could have taken into account but that is proper.</text>

            <text syncTime="772.031" offset="3188621">I might disagree, in fact, by the time you take into account the number of variables with which Congress has to deal, divorce status as opposed to non-divorce status, age, dependency, and you could go on for about five or six.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.708" offset="3251315">And then you consider all of the different combinations that can enter in.</text>

            <text syncTime="920.208" offset="3781288">Thank you Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.755" offset="3791528">There are at least three differences between wives in this context, and divorced wives, all of which fall within the broad egis or protection of the family as a unit and some of which very specifically were identified by Congress as constituting part of its basis which congress could rationally take into account in making the decision that it did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="952.165" offset="3909183">The first is that the death, retirement or disability for the wage earner has an effect on the family income in the usual case.</text>
            <text syncTime="963.989" offset="3956412">In the usual divorce situation, this is not true.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.503" offset="3966443">In 6.5% of the cases, it is but as I mentioned a moment ago, Lucas held that Congress may make distinctions based on the relative livelihood of dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.769" offset="4007508">In that case it was legitimates versus illegitimates, here it is wives dependency versus divorced wives dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.872" offset="4040004">The second difference is that there is a living benefit to the wage earner, in that secondary insurance to members of his family increases the family income and does so at the time that there is a reduction in the overall family income.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.333" offset="4105833">And finally, the payment of benefits to the wife minimizes the extent to which the family’s normal routine must be disrupted by the wage earners termination of his employment, which was the precise factor that Congress mentioned at the time that it enacted the 1958 edition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.801" offset="4183678">The problems of divorced wives Mr. Justice White are not to be denied but the disadvantages under which their labor are created by the fact of divorce and not by the Social Security Program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.796" offset="4239684">The aspects of impact on the family from death, retirement or disability with which Congress was attempting to deal in this incremental program which had enacted are simply lacking in the divorce context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.334" offset="4297781">The fact that her ex-husband has reached retirement has no effect on the extent of Mrs. de Castro’s need.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.352" offset="4333934">Therefore, unlike Weisenfeld, for example, this is not a case where the event that triggered the particular benefit to one class but not another is an event that is accompanied by some hardship on the non-receiving class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.353" offset="4409898">The final observation that I would like to make and I will reserve some time is that even if the legislative history in this case were not as clear as it is, and while Congress did not cover all the basis, we submit the reasons that we just discussed and as set forth in our brief, they did a pretty good job that under the consistent rulings of this court un-clarity as to whether Congress has chosen a proper purpose or an improper purpose works to the benefit, rather than to the detriment of the statute, because under the consistent rulings of this court, the purpose of statutory interpretation is to save and not to destroy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.740" offset="4575410">It would, we submit, be a gross distortion of this principle, to ascribe to Congress, a purpose that it did not have but that would raise serious constitutional questions, especially when both Congress and this court had made it so clear that the focus of these provisions is the protection of the family, it is as Mr. Justice Powell observed in his concurring opinion in Weisenfeld, social security is designed certainly in this context, for the protection of the family.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.885" offset="4700066">That was the over riding consideration at the time that Congress first got in to the business of extending secondary insurance, social insurance benefits in 1939, it has been the single over arching purpose since that time and every subsidiary rationale is consistent with it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1167.088" offset="4768821">The one item that remains for discussion in the course of this legislative history is the history of the one provision, in 1965 that extended secondary benefits to the divorced wife whose husband or who's wage earner, ex-husband is not diseased.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.558" offset="4858682">Here again, the legislative history is very precise and it reveals that Congress intended to handle or to take care of one problem, and one problem only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.458" offset="4906329">It might be said or one of the purpose might have been generally to provide for needy divorced wives, or to provide for the children of needy divorced wives, that was not the purpose of the 1965 amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.906" offset="4960141">The legislative history on this matter is very precise and I quote “It is not uncommon for a marriage to end in divorce after many years, when the wife is too old to build up a social security earnings record even if she can find a job”.</text>
            <text syncTime="1229.387" offset="5018029">Very narrow problem and that is the narrow problem which Congress dealt, and that is one of the two reasons, Mr. Chief Justice, for the 20 year requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.478" offset="5054391">The one was an attempt to avoid the multiple claimant situation and the other was to take care of the situation in which a couple are married for many years and at the conclusion of that marriage, the wife is simply too old even if she could find a job to get back into the market and build up a social security earnings record on her own account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.708" offset="5135266">Consequently it was the wife, the older divorced wife who was the focus of the 1965 amendment and not the child.</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.706" offset="5383325">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.428" offset="5398163">The issue in this case revolves around the constitutionality of Section 202(b)(1)(b) of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.232" offset="5437451">That section creates two classes of women.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.348" offset="5453856">The first class is composed of wives under age 62 with dependent children in their care to whom benefits are granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.872" offset="5491994">The second class is composed of wives who have secured divorces after at least 20 years of marriage who are also under age 62 and who also have dependent children of the marriage in their care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.166" offset="5549150">To this group no social security benefits are granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.299" offset="5565660">And the question that arises is whether this different treatment of married wives and divorced wives with dependent children in their care under age 62 is justified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1378.305" offset="5613725">Thus, the line that Congress has drawn between married wives and divorced wives with entitled children bear some rationale relationship to legitimate legislative purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.715" offset="5671299">It seems to me that it becomes very important for this court to determine what the purpose of this provision of Section 202(b)(1)(b) is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.476" offset="5714349">I submit that the purpose of that provision is to facilitate parental care for dependent children by enabling mothers to remain at home and care for those children.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.077" offset="5760742">I think this purpose is clear when you examine Section 202(b)(1)(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.265" offset="5785506">It provides first of all, benefits to wives and divorced wives upon attaining age 62 regardless of whether or not they have children in their care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1433.217" offset="5833363">But a young wife, under age 62 is given benefits only if she has a dependent child in her care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1441.759" offset="5867531">The young wife who does not have a dependent child in her care receives no benefits until she attains age 62.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.596" offset="5898878">It seems to me that if Congress were concerned solely for the welfare of the wife, there would be no necessity to condition her eligibility for benefits upon the presence of a child in her care.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.834" offset="5955825">Evidently, Congress was concerned not with the welfare of the wife herself but for the child that she bore responsibility for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.526" offset="5994590">Moreover, if you look at the provisions that terminate the benefits that are paid to a wife with a child in her care, you see that the benefits cease when the benefits that are paid to a child cease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.286" offset="6057598">In other words, the wives benefits are linked to the child’s benefits and are paid only so long as it was realistic to think that the child would need his mother's care.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.726" offset="6171387">Well, the standard for testing the constitutionality of congressional legislation, as I understand it, is that the classification drawn by Congress has to bear a relationship to a legitimate legislative purpose and I think it is important to identify that purpose and to see whether the classification drawn relates to it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1587.222" offset="6449330">I think the purpose of providing benefits to a wife with a child in her care was enacted or thought of, back in 1950 when benefits were first accorded to wives with children.</text>

            <text syncTime="1992.237" offset="8069444">The secretary has argued that there is a rationale basis for this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.436" offset="8098179">He argues first of all that wives as a class are substantially more likely to be dependent upon their husbands than divorced wives and are thus likely to suffer a loss of support when the husband becomes disabled or retires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.462" offset="8166306">The basis for that statement are two surveys, a 1925 survey and a 1975 survey, that he cites in his brief and the citation states that only 14% of divorced women receive alimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.565" offset="8238718">It is important, I think to reflect upon what we are not told by those statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.118" offset="8260974">We do not know the percentage of divorced women with children who receive alimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="2674.642" offset="10799031">First of all with regard to Mathews v. Lucas, I can understand the appellee’s reluctance to discuss this case we submit that it is dispositive for at least two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.140" offset="10845007">One is, that it is bare whole of thing amounts to nothing less in the proposition that Congress is entitled to make distinctions based upon the relative likelihood of dependency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2698.744" offset="10895475">In that case, legitimacy versus illegitimacy, in this case wives who are dependent on their wage earner husbands as opposed to divorced wives or whom the alimony picture is rather rebelling as it has been set forth in the statistics.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.142" offset="10969036">The second significance perhaps goes to an even more fundamental point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.205" offset="10993278">And it is that as I read Lucas, it contains a reaffirmation of the principle that if there is un-clarity in the statute, and its history as to what the purpose of the statute is, you do not describe to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2742.367" offset="11069973">That un-clarity works to the benefit of the statute and not to his detriment, that it does not result in ascribing to the statute, a purpose will declare it unconstitutional and specifically, in Mathews v. Lucas, the root error of the lower court was the same root error in this court and that is that that court concluded that that act was not intended to merely replace actual support of the child lost but also obligations to support or potential support.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.020" offset="11692523">Loss depends on the wage earner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.981" offset="11716452">And a different basis that is applicable to the family unit because of the loss of dependence on the wage earner, which does not exist in the non-family context, and that brings me to the proposition that I looked to very only tangentially earlier, and the point I think that Mr. Justice Stevens was making, and that is that here, unlike Weisenfeld, you have really a list of possible interrelating considerations that could enter in the Congress’s deliberations, age, widow had her survivorship, the relationship to the wage earner, dependency, the time the marriage endured and whether there were entitled children in her care.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.123" offset="11897010">Every one of those is a variable, and if you make your determination rest solely upon need, then virtually the entire statutory scheme has to fall because as my opponent has conceded and indeed must concede, the need of one who has been married 19 years by hypothesis will be just as great as the one who has been married 20 years and one month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.594" offset="12010904">The need of Mrs. de Castro does not increase the day that she turns 62.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.249" offset="12033474">And similarly, again the relevance to Mr. Justice White of the support figures, in all that 6 5% of the case, the need does not increase when the husband dies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.542" offset="12086659">So that if the focus is just on number one, an assumed purpose, and number two, a purpose that is not in fact the purpose, the Congress had in mind, then the attack on the statute will reach all across as of many-many of its aspects.</text>

            <text syncTime="3029.679" offset="12219152">All of which leads to the proposition that the only legal issue that is involved in this case, is the same legal issue that the court first considered in Nebbia v. New York, that it has thankfully reaffirmed in Williamson v. Lee Optical, in Salfi, and in Mathews v. Lucas that in the area of allocation of scarce social insurance resources as in the area of economic regulation, So long as Congress cannot be clearly identified to have relied to an improper purpose as it did in Weisenfeld, and so long it has not discriminated, as it has not done in this case, then those policy judgments in allocating scarce resources for social insurance, rest within the sound discretion of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.137" offset="12409010">Under that standard, it is very clear, we submit that the judgment of the lower court must be reversed.</text>
