            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="141016">We'll hear arguments first this morning in 86 Original, Louisiana against Mississippi and others.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.189" offset="177692">Mr. Palmer, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_i_palmer_jr" startTime="12.891" stopTime="158.368">
            <label>Mr. J. I. Palmer, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="12.891" offset="192529">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.176" offset="209666">Louisiana and Mississippi once again disagree about the location of our common boundary in the Mississippi River.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.163" offset="233594">In this litigation we're concerned with about a four-mile stretch of the river which is situated approximately three and a half miles north of the Natchez, Mississippi, bridge.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.071" offset="281241">This case is remarkably similar to the one that you decided in 1966, that being No. 14 Original, in that, while the facts are similar, we also have here an oil well which was drilled in 1972 from the Mississippi side of the river and your decision will in large measure determine, among several issues, in which state this oil well is located.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.490" offset="394926">Mississippi has filed exceptions to the report of the Master in this case and they focused on two basic areas: One is the manner in which the Master analyzed the evidence in the case and fashioned his recommendations to you; and the other is the Master's refusal to draw a specific boundary by geodetic coordinates for the entire area in dispute for the time period in dispute, which is essentially 1972 through 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.593" offset="519374">Now, as the Master's report correctly reflects, Your Honors, Louisiana and Mississippi both recognize that the law of the thalweg controls here.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.449" offset="558766">Your landmark decision of Iowa versus Illinois in 1892 announced the basic law of the case, and in 1906 when you decided Louisiana versus Mississippi in the first instance you told both states that the law of the thalweg controls.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.243" offset="625953">So to that extent we agree on the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.445" offset="634730">Of course, the thalweg principle has two basic predicates, one being the principles of accretion and avulsion... excuse me, accretion and erosion... and the other being the principles of avulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.603" offset="687393">Now, the Master on page 4 of his report suggests to you both in the text and in footnote number one that this Court now is involved only with the principles of accretion and erosion as they would apply to the so-called live thalweg of the river in this area.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="158.368" stopTime="160.485">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="158.368" offset="774433">Counsel, what page is footnote number one on?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_i_palmer_jr" startTime="160.485" stopTime="207.599">
            <label>Mr. J. I. Palmer, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="160.485" offset="782897">Page 4, Mr. Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.837" offset="792301">You'll see that the Master asserts in that footnote his presumption that all parties agree that only the live thalweg is at issue here and that, he says, that the sole evidence before this Court relates to that live thalweg.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.997" offset="852905">We say that is a rather bold and erroneous statement of what's in the record before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.536" offset="883103">You'll find, first of all, that in Louisiana's complaint, Your Honors, she alleges that the boundary that we're arguing about here was fixed by the law of avulsion as a result of the 1933 Corps of Engineers cut-off of Giles Bend, which is just to the south and constitutes the southern half of this boundary.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="207.599" stopTime="211.170">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="207.599" offset="971396">Well, that's not inconsistent with the thalweg being live, is it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_i_palmer_jr" startTime="211.170" stopTime="332.699">
            <label>Mr. J. I. Palmer, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="211.170" offset="985607">Your Honor, we say to the Court that the thalweg or the boundary in this case consists in the upper part of the live thalweg and in the lower part of the so-called dead thalweg in the Giles Bend Cut-Off.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.929" offset="1048719">The state boundary must be continuous, and in this particular location, Your Honor, the thalweg proceeds on its live course until it hits the upper terminus of the dead thalweg which was caused by the Corps of Engineers cutoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.439" offset="1106711">And that's one of the key contentions of Mississippi here, is that Louisiana not only asserted that the law of avulsion is involved here, but both states throughout trial introduced ample evidence to show the location of the old dead thalweg and also how that has been affected by the westwardly movement of the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.388" offset="1198557">I would call your attention, Your Honor, to the fact that, in addition to the assertions of both states in the pleadings, the very second exhibit which was introduced at trial, which was Joint Exhibit No. 1, is a map depicting several features in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.699" offset="1279746">The surface location of the well on the Mississippi side of the river, the bottom location, and the specific coordinates and position of the 1964 dead thalweg is shown on that very exhibit and described by metes and bounds coordinates.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.245" offset="1349963">Additionally, several exhibits introduced by Louisiana at trial show that 1964 dead thalweg.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.635" offset="1387475">Now, in questioning by the Master during the course of the trial, the witness at that time said that for the purposes of that present testimony that depiction of the '64 dead thalweg was not then relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.610" offset="1439406">But counsel for Louisiana was asked about those drawings; he said that they weren't relevant then, but might become so later.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="332.699" stopTime="355.378">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="332.699" offset="1471798">Well, Mr. Palmer, on reading footnote one of the Master's report to which you refer, he says:</text>
            <text syncTime="340.019" offset="1501055">"I take the position of all parties to be that the location of the Louisiana-Mississippi boundary relative to the bottom hole location of the well must be determined by reference to the live thalweg. "</text>
            <text syncTime="352.660" offset="1551628">Now, is that an incorrect statement in your view?</text>

          <turn speaker="j_i_palmer_jr" startTime="355.378" stopTime="375.709">
            <label>Mr. J. I. Palmer, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="355.378" offset="1562495">Your Honor, the implication or the suggestion of the statement is that all we are concerned about is the location of the boundary with respect to that well, and that we say is the fundamental problem here.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.340" offset="1630309">We're concerned about the location of the boundary throughout the area in dispute.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="375.709" offset="1643788">Okay.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.526" offset="1647027">But is that a correct statement if you don't draw the implication from it that you do, that with respect to the location of the oil well that it's the live thalweg that is going to govern?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_i_palmer_jr" startTime="389.785" stopTime="425.892">
            <label>Mr. J. I. Palmer, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="389.785" offset="1700108">Your Honor, a latitude line drawn through the bottom hole location in an east-west direction would intersect that portion of this boundary which is live.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.241" offset="1737934">It would not intersect that portion of the boundary which is part of the dead thalweg.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.795" offset="1756115">So to that extent that is a correct statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.830" offset="1768236">The problem we have, Your Honor, is the suggestion of the footnote, which is consistent with the Master's report to you, that all he wants to do is look at that one point on the boundary.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.269" offset="1810032">And we say no, because, as I will mention in a moment, the ownership of this well is but one of the results of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.042" offset="1841169">Now--</text>

            <text syncTime="429.011" offset="1857052">Is there a top hole?</text>

            <text syncTime="436.932" offset="1888712">The oil well was drilled deviationally, in an angular fashion, under the river.</text>

            <text syncTime="453.376" offset="1954436">I take it that you say the period that you're concerned with ends in 1982, and to the extent the thalweg is live, if you fix the boundary at the end of the period in '82, it would no longer be the boundary anyway, would it?</text>

            <text syncTime="493.019" offset="2113052">First of all, as we have said, both states have asked that the boundary be drawn, and here are the reasons that we say it's extremely important here.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.959" offset="2148787">First of all, Louisiana through its own exhibits in evidence has shown that their recommended boundary falls well to the west of the 1964 dead thalweg.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.782" offset="2200092">Now, that taken to be true, Louisiana herself has proved that she has lost land in that time period and Mississippi has gained land in that time period.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.490" offset="2242933">Therefore, Mississippi has acquired additional lands over which to assess ad valorem taxes, we have additional lands to exert our police jurisdiction over.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.446" offset="2282743">Louisiana conversely, having lost some land, has those drilling units, one of which surrounds this oil well, diminished in scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.886" offset="2320464">And if we sit here and let Louisiana continue to claim out to a dead thalweg which she herself proves doesn't exist any more, you're talking about giving a state more land than even she has said she's entitled to.</text>

            <text syncTime="585.613" offset="2483468">The Master in his suggestions to you as a basis for not drawing that line used your precedent, the old ICC case back in 1911 or thereabouts.</text>

            <text syncTime="620.902" offset="2624529">There are two more: One, this Court has in the past, and certainly will in the future probably, entertained petitions for the entry of a supplemental decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.677" offset="2667684">In the event that the evidence shows in the future that the boundary has moved radically to the west, then of course Mississippi would come before you and ask for the entry of a supplemental decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.167" offset="2713659">The case would be reopened, additional facts would be presented.</text>
