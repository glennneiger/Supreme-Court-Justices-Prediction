            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="93.210" offset="522472">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the consolidated cases involving the same Chapter 11 debtor in possession, the Court of Appeals in this case prescribed a standard to be used by a bankruptcy court in determining whether to approve an application to reject a collective bargaining agreement as an executory contract, and how that approval of such rejection operates retroactively to deprive employees of rights under the contract during the entire post-bankruptcy petition period, and thus to deprive the National Labor Relations Board of authority to remedy as an unfair labor practice the debtor in possession's unilateral departure from the contractually prescribed terms and conditions of employment during the post-petition, pre-rejection period.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.715" offset="780457">We believe the court of appeals erred in both respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.559" offset="799788">Because I have only 15 minutes, and hope to reserve a little time, because much can happen during the ensuing 45, all I can try to do is summarize what we think are the governing principles, and why our position best accommodates the two federal statutes involved and maximizes the effectiveness of each.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.000" offset="889649">All the courts of appeals that have considered the question have agreed, and the respondent in this Court does not dispute that a special standard must govern rejection of a collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.246" offset="954537">This is partly because of the special nature of such an agreement, as prescribing a code of industrial conduct, and because the employees, unlike others, are totally dependent for their livelihood on their relation with the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.785" offset="1036770">But the basic reason is because of a statutory conflict between the application to a collective bargaining agreement of the bankruptcy court's authority to set aside an executory contract and the Labor Relations Act's prohibition of mid-term modification or termination of a collective bargaining agreement unless both parties to the agreement agree.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="252.521" offset="1159650">Mr. Wallace, is it so much a conflict between two statutes as a problem of executory contracts of a different character, one with a supplier, perhaps, and one with an employee?</text>
            <text syncTime="267.015" offset="1217642">Is that really conflict in the statutes?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="270.653" stopTime="338.891">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="270.653" offset="1232166">Well, the Labor Act does say that there cannot be midterm rejection or modification, termination or modification of a labor contract, of a collective bargaining agreement, unless both parties agree pursuant to prescribed procedures, and yet there is reason to think that the authority of the bankruptcy court to set aside executory contracts does extend to collective bargaining agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.300" offset="1354837">On the face of the statutes, they do look in opposite directions, and Congress has not explicitly said how this conflict should be resolved, but as we explain in our brief, we believe it implicitly ratified the resolution that had been developed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which was the only appellate decision at the time Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Code, and Congress did indicate some awareness of those decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="430.650" offset="1872166">We do think that the Eleventh Circuit's opinion is very close to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="438.754" offset="1904663">Although it explicitly says it disagrees with it, it does say in another passage that it thinks that a factor that the Second Circuit says is essential is going to be an important inquiry in many, many instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.357" offset="1971014">The case will turn on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.639" offset="1980104">And that is the inquiry whether rejection of the collective bargaining agreement is necessary to avoid collapse of the business as necessary to the preservation of the viability of the business.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.225" offset="2042485">This, we believe, should be the central inquiry, because for one thing it is a question that is properly within the competency of a bankruptcy court to determine, unlike the kind of second guessing of the collective bargaining process that otherwise is suggested in opinions about balancing the equities to determine whether terms and conditions of employment other than those bargained for would be fairer under the circumstances to both the employees and the employer, and to take into account what is the likelihood that a strike might be provoked if the collective bargaining agreement is set aside, the kinds of inquiries that Congress, as this Court has emphasized, has left to the bargaining process and the parties themselves, and has prohibited even experts in labor management relations, such as the Labor Board, from second guessing the bargaining process with respect to, and the kind of inquiries that it is difficult to conceive of Congress asking a bankruptcy court to resolve.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.940" offset="2385316">And while the standard focusing on preservation of the business, its viability, thus would preserve the basic policy of the Bankruptcy Act, it would also maximize preservation of rights under the Labor Act by reducing only to a risk of error in the resolution of that question the preservation of rights that otherwise would survive under the labor contract, and by making it less apt that the bankruptcy court's decision will provoke a work stoppage because of unacceptability to the employees who have been operating under the contract if they perceive that the question that has been answered is whether their contract rights can survive in any event, and that has been the inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.928" offset="2649361">It also puts in the proper context for bankruptcy court resolution such emotional matters as evidence on anti-union animus that may have motivated the employer to go into bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.795" offset="2728774">The bankruptcy court by and large should regard that as going to the credibility of the employers being able to show that it is necessary in the context of a comprehensive look at his operations and his obligations, that it is necessary to set aside the collective bargaining agreement in order for the business to survive.</text>

            <text syncTime="673.988" offset="2845593">Mr. Wallace, if it is legitimate for a company to file a bankruptcy petition because executory contracts are making successful continuation of the business impossible, is it permissible for a company to file a bankruptcy petition for the express purpose of freeing itself from an executory collective bargaining agreement that it feels is making it impossible?</text>

            <text syncTime="703.627" offset="2964085">We see nothing improper about that, if the company can make the requisite showing in the context of all of its obligations and operations that it needs to have that contract set aside in order for the business to remain a viable one, or to be converted into a viable one.</text>

            <text syncTime="745.484" offset="3131582">It is a predictive matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="746.502" offset="3135657">There is no way that the future can be proved with certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.014" offset="3161675">On the relation back issue, if I can advert to that basically, we see no conflict between the bankruptcy law and the labor law.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.868" offset="3209113">The bankruptcy law sharply differentiates between pre-petition and post-petition obligations of the trustee or debtor in possession in order to encourage persons to continue to provide goods and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.346" offset="3279017">A vendor, for example, obligated to provide lumber or potatoes or what have you, is prohibited by the bankruptcy law from terminating the contract merely because the other party goes into bankruptcy, and the obvious meaning of that is that as he continues to supply those goods until the contract is set aside he is operating under the terms of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="811.300" offset="3394792">The same thing would be true of employees where terminable at will but who are kept on by the debtor in possession.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.221" offset="3422481">It would never occur to anyone that the debtor in possession could four months later go to the bankruptcy court and ask the bankruptcy court retroactively to change the salaries or the health benefits that those employees were told they were entitled to while they were performing those services, and the mere fact that there may be reason to ask the court to set aside further obligations under a collective bargaining agreement does not provide a reason to treat employees operating under that agreement any differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.457" offset="3563438">If anything, it brings in considerations of the Labor Act as well.</text>

            <text syncTime="869.512" offset="3627699">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I adopt the position of the Solicitor General with respect to the standard issue, and instead I would move on to the subject of 8(D), which is the requirement in the National Labor Relations Act which compels a party seeking to modify or terminate a contract to give notice to and to negotiate with the other party.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.126" offset="3734070">We think that 8(D) should be a condition precedent to the rejection of a union contract, because we think 8(D) is in the public interest as a public statute designed to protect the common weal.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.868" offset="3789032">We are only asking for purposes of this discussion that not all of the trappings and the trimmings of 8(D) be superimposed upon the employer or the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="917.975" offset="3821528">Rather, we simply ask a party to give notice to and to negotiate with the other party to that contract before the contract is automatically rejected ipso facto.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.189" offset="3878370">If the employer refuses to come to an agreement, and mind you that we have never suggested that concessions must be made by the employer, but if the renegotiations do not work out, or if the union simply refuses to negotiate, the employer is then free to seek rejection of the contract in the bankruptcy court, and Justice O'Connor, in response to your question, we do indeed agree with the Solicitor General that generally a labor contract is an executory contract which may be, in appropriate circumstances, subject to the correct standard, be rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.644" offset="4020163">But again, as a legitimate and viable condition precedent to that rejection, we think there should be negotiations.</text>

            <text syncTime="980.897" offset="4073139">It is designed, above all, to again protect the public interest and to pay due respect to the Bankruptcy Code, and to the interests and to the rights of employers who are financially embarrassed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1642.759" offset="6720597">Either a new entity is or is not bound, and the entire problem of new entity, as the successorship theory, gives pause.</text>

            <text syncTime="1664.315" offset="6806906">And I think... not a commentator, but I think at least one and perhaps two of the circuits have said the same thing, that it is... it makes no sense to say that the employer who is a new entity must nonetheless go in and apply to reject the contract... the contract.</text>

            <text syncTime="1860.718" offset="7592460">First, this case does not concern the issue of whether a financially healthy company should be or will be permitted to utilize the provisions of Chapter 11 for the sole purpose of escaping from a union contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.900" offset="7649198">Such a factual setting and motivation have never been alleged in this case, and there is no suggestion in the record that this was Bildisco's situation or motivation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.084" offset="7693920">In addition, the balancing of the equities test formulated by the Third Circuit will itself prevent this result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.942" offset="7725371">Under this test, the bankruptcy court is required to scrutinize the good or bad faith of the debtor who seeks to reject a labor contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.061" offset="7765809">Moreover, if a company is not truly financially distressed, the equities will undoubtedly tip in favor of the union, and rejection will not be permitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="3059.797" offset="12388751">Number One, the debtor must show as a threshold that the contract is burdensome, and then, the burden is still on the debtor to show that the balancing of the equities tips in favor of rejection, that the harm to employees is outweighed by the benefit to everyone else involved in the reorganization process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.901" offset="12477254">I think that that in itself is quite a stringent standard, especially in the absence of any suggestion in the Bankruptcy Code that collective bargaining agreements are to be treated differently than any other type of executory contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3094.910" offset="12529290">Under all other types of executory contracts, the so-called business judgment test, of course, is applied, and that is simply a requirement that the debtor show that rejection of the contract would benefit the estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.370" offset="12591043">I suggest that any time a debtor in possession moves to reject a contract, it is going to be able to show that, at least in the majority of the cases, or it wouldn't be seeking to reject.</text>
            <text syncTime="3120.088" offset="12629913">But in place of that benefit to the estate concept, which doesn't give any import whatsoever to the harm to the non-debtor party to the contract, the Third Circuit has said, courts must focus attention in collective bargaining agreements on the harm to the non-debtor party, in this case the union employees, and consider what the potential impact of rejection is going to be on those employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.389" offset="12735134">I think that in itself is quite a leap forward from the business judgment test, and it is quite a bit of a more stringent showing which must be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.554" offset="12779856">If I might in the time remaining address myself to some of the arguments which have been made in opposition to the new entity theory, what we have is a criticism that... of the theory on the grounds that since management and operations and work force of a debtor in possession are often unchanged, the debtor in possession is more properly deemed as the alter ego of a pre-bankruptcy company rather than as a new entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.135" offset="12930112">I suggest that the Second and Third Circuits, both of which have adopted the new entity analysis, really had it right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3574.982" offset="14449499">In closing, I would just like to state that what I believe the Third Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit in Brada Miller have done is to truly accommodate the goals behind the bankruptcy laws and the goals behind the labor laws, without forcing one to give way before the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.783" offset="14556705">The test that was formulated by the Third Circuit does not unduly promote the interests of organized labor to the point where it holds a stranglehold position on the fate of a Chapter 11 debtor, and at the same time, it does not unduly sacrifice the rights and the interests of organized labor to achieve a successful reorganization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3630.581" offset="14671957">It is an integration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.785" offset="14676764">It is truly a balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3634.753" offset="14688571">We think that it is fair to all parties involved in the reorganization process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.751" offset="14712604">We think it is workable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.267" offset="14718664">And for those reasons, we urge that this Court affirm the decision below.</text>

            <text syncTime="3659.040" offset="14785747">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.477" offset="14795464">As we point out on Page 16 of our brief, the National Labor Relations Act refers specifically to trustees in bankruptcy as persons covered by the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3676.018" offset="14853665">The Board here in its findings on Page 34-A of the appendix to the petition found that the respondent was an alter ego of Bildisco, using the term in much the way this Court used it in the Howard Johnson case, in a footnote that began,</text>
            <text syncTime="3698.241" offset="14942586">"It is important to emphasize that in that case it was not an alter ego. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.506" offset="14963588">And the collective bargaining agreement itself specified that it would apply to successors to Bildisco.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.096" offset="15006011">Here you have the same ownership under a different arrangement operating the same enterprise, and the contract therefore continued to apply under standard principles of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3734.526" offset="15087722">Now, if a vendor of lumber or potatoes continues to supply the bankrupt debtor in possession until that contract is rejected, his rights are prescribed by the contract, as we understand the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.409" offset="15159193">The contract not only says what he should be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.391" offset="15171210">It will specify terms of delivery, when the payment should be made, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.264" offset="15194615">There are rights prescribed by the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.232" offset="15206527">The bankruptcy court doesn't have some general measure of the market value of what he is entitled to for the services that he continued to--</text>

            <text syncTime="3776.181" offset="15254279">But, Mr. Wallace, doesn't the Bankruptcy Act, Section 365(g)(1), if an executory contract is rejected, expressly provide that then it will relate back to the date of filing of the petition, so technically perhaps--</text>

            <text syncTime="3796.423" offset="15335259">--confusion, because all that refers to in our view is a damage claim for rejection of further rights under that contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3808.230" offset="15382488">The other party to the contract can then claim that he was damaged, and can show what the monetary damages were, and that claim relates back, and he stands on the same basis as pre-petition creditors for those further claims, but while he was performing, up until the time of rejection, his rights are prescribed by the contract, and that is part of the administrative expense of trying to make this business thrive by assuring people that they can continue to deal with this business without worrying that their rights are going to be compromised by the pre-existing indebtedness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3849.994" offset="15549567">And the same thing is true for employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.948" offset="15557404">The contract here under which they were working didn't just prescribe wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3856.818" offset="15576839">It has many provisions about health contributions, welfare contributions, union dues, sick leave rights, paid holidays, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.221" offset="15622501">All of those rights were prescribed by the contract just as if the employer had said to non-contract employees, if you stay on with me, it will be at $800 a month, and I will pay health insurance benefits.</text>
