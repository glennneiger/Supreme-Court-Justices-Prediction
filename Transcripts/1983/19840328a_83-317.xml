            <text syncTime="31.602" offset="265786">This matter is before this Court on a petition for certiorari to the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed two injunctive orders concerning operational aspects of the Los Angeles County men's central jail, a 5,000 inmate facility operated by the sheriff of the County of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.782" offset="358573">The first order required the sheriff to select up to 1500 inmates from the 5,000 inmate population who he determined presented the least likely opportunity or risk of escape or drug potential and to permit them to visit in a setting where they could touch, kiss and embrace their visitors, a practice that has been referred to in the courts as contact visitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.570" offset="481662">The second order required the sheriff to permit inmates to observe routine cell searches and to ask questions during the searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.545" offset="525548">This is a large jail, as a reflection of the size of the County of Los Angeles, which encompasses over 4,000 square miles and a population approaching eight million people.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.768" offset="578524">That's roughly half the size of the State of Maryland, with about twice that state's population.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederick R. Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="126.561" offset="645607">Although all male inmates are centralized at one facility, in part because of the size of the County and because of some duties that are imposed upon the sheriff under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.752" offset="694403">He is required to accept the prisoners from the police departments of the 82 independent cities within the County of Los Angeles.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.393" offset="736931">He has no discretion to refuse them, and is required to transport on a daily basis one-fifth of that jail's population to 26 separate jurisdictional courts located throughout the wide expanse of the County and bring them back again at night.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.871" offset="818851">The jail has a high turnover.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.092" offset="835778">It receives over 200,000 prisoners a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.246" offset="860438">The stay for most of these is quite short because of the state's rather liberal pretrial release statutes, primarily with regard to misdemeanants.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.951" offset="899203">Most inmates stay within the facility less than ten days.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.172" offset="916131">On the other hand, there are longer-term inmates within the facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.576" offset="937760">These are primarily persons accused of more serious felonies, that are involved in protracted criminal process and appellate process, and they may serve between two and four months or longer between arrest and sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.102" offset="1003798">The Court's order with regard to--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="220.323" stopTime="229.095">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="220.323" offset="1020725">Mr. Bennett, when you say they're involved in appellate process, you mean perhaps a motion to suppress that's appealed prior to trial, that sort of thing?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frederick_r_bennett" startTime="229.095" stopTime="269.720">
            <label>Mr. Frederick R. Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="229.095" offset="1055834">--It could be that.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.611" offset="1061894">We have really three classes of prisoners within the jail as far as are relevant here.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.951" offset="1091256">Many of these inmates when they're arrested are picked up on warrants from many of the courts around the jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.521" offset="1121453">They may be sentenced on one charge, awaiting trial on another.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.240" offset="1136395">The state sometimes leaves those sentenced inmates with us during some appellate processes before they may be transferred to a state prison facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.865" offset="1182893">So it is possible, in both appeals and writs, which is a common practice in the California courts, that they could be involved in appellate process.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="269.720" stopTime="274.457">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="269.720" offset="1218315">But they're not members of the class, are they?</text>
            <text syncTime="271.438" offset="1225107">Isn't the class just pretrial detainees?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frederick_r_bennett" startTime="274.457" stopTime="288.967">
            <label>Mr. Frederick R. Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="274.457" offset="1237228">Technically, it was certified as to all prisoners within the jail, which at the time of certification involved a significant number of sentenced inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.730" offset="1278292">Now the facility is predominately pretrial.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="288.967" offset="1295324">I thought the Court of Appeals' opinion referred only to pretrial detainees, that the order only referred to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="296.221" offset="1324268">In the progress of this case, virtually all counsel and the courts at all levels focused only on the matters that dealt with pretrial detainees, although--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="307.595" offset="1369825">I mean, the legal issues would be quite different if they were sentenced people, would they not?</text>

          <turn speaker="frederick_r_bennett" startTime="312.963" stopTime="314.665">
            <label>Mr. Frederick R. Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="312.963" offset="1391246">--That's perhaps true as to some issues.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="314.665" stopTime="325.640">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="314.665" offset="1398038">But there still are within the technically certified class a small minority who are not pretrial detainees?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frederick_r_bennett" startTime="325.640" stopTime="516.560">
            <label>Mr. Frederick R. Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="325.640" offset="1441923">We can't say how small, because if an inmate is sentenced on one charge and is a sentenced inmate, but is awaiting trial on other charges, of which there are many within our facility, we treat him for our classification purposes as if he is a pretrial detainee.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.351" offset="1520813">The court's order requiring us to select up to 1500 inmates for these contact visits is in addition to the sheriff's existing procedures to provide inmates an opportunity to maintain their personal relationships, and the sheriff has a three-pronged plan and program to accomplish that.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.566" offset="1617675">All inmates in the jail have daily access to telephone calls, for unmonitored telephone calls.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.970" offset="1651321">There is fairly unrestricted mail.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.438" offset="1661143">And all inmates have the daily opportunity for a non-contact visit in a setting where inmates and their visitors sit in separated booths on either side of a large glass window and speak over telephones.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.466" offset="1733241">In this fashion the sheriff, rather incredibly, handles over 2,000 visitors a day, over 63,000 visitors a month at this one facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.726" offset="1790292">The sheriff has two concerns which led him to adopt this three-pronged plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.749" offset="1822371">As the district court noted and observed, the sheriff is committed to and well recognizes the importance of permitting inmates to maintain their personal relationships.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.841" offset="1882766">At the same time, the sheriff is also committed to housing his prisoners in as safe a manner as possible and free from injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.399" offset="1924980">And to accomplish these two goals, he has chosen this three-pronged plan of daily telephone calls, unrestricted mail, and non-contact visits because it maximizes the frequency of the opportunity to maintain these personal relationships, while at the same time minimizing the risks involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.216" offset="2032291">And it's fairly obvious why there's no risk under this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.918" offset="2047128">The visitors never enter the security of the facility, the inmates never leave it.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.489" offset="2069385">There is no opportunity to pass contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.957" offset="2083282">Because of this and in this fashion, this large number of visitors can be easily handled with minimal risk and without intrusive security measures associated with most other types of visitation: no strip searches, no appointments, no screening, no limitation on the visitors that you can see or their names... without any of those intrusive measures.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="516.560" stopTime="539.692">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="516.560" offset="2205639">Is there a claim here, Mr. Bennett, that those objectives could have been accomplished by less intrusive, less restrictive measures?</text>
            <text syncTime="527.534" offset="2249525">That is, using a wire screen that would prevent the passing of weapons or narcotics, but eliminating the telephone?</text>
            <text syncTime="537.992" offset="2291425">Is there a claim?</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederick R. Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="539.692" offset="2298217">They did not make that request.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.294" offset="2312532">Unlike some district court cases concerning other jails where the phones were always inoperative and people had to scream back and forth to be heard, I think the record reflects that this is a fairly modern visitation facility, with well-maintained telephones.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.239" offset="2376376">The thrust of the plaintiff's claim was contact visits, permitting kissing, touching and embracing, and not so much the fact that one had to communicate over the telephone.</text>

            <text syncTime="583.038" offset="2471566">Well, I think that the New York facility is certainly different from ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.259" offset="2492464">Even though it's maybe the second or third largest jail in the country, ours is more than twice its size, with unique problems that make it quite different.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.816" offset="2538648">Plus, administrators place different priorities on things within their own circumstances and exercise a different level of prudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.922" offset="2579086">I think the most telling evidence in this case was the testimony of Warden Gaston of the Ryker's Island facility, who was the warden of their largest jail that had permitted contact visits for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.265" offset="2636451">He said two things:</text>

            <text syncTime="665.259" offset="2800395">We do have a drug problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.959" offset="2807291">Within our jail are probably as large a group of drug-oriented gangs that are organized to control drug trafficking within the jail through threats and violence, more than you'll find in any other facility in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.736" offset="2874374">Drugs do exist in our facility, because we can't control the inmates at court, they can be hidden in packages in mail, and that is a problem within our facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.861" offset="2918887">Significantly, at the New York facility, if we listen to Warden Gaston from Ryker's Island, when they permit contact visits he's found that the most prevalent use is the use of a balloon, that is swallowed... that is passed through a kiss and swallowed to retrieve later.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.323" offset="2988686">He pointed out that their drug problem was so pervasive that on more than one occasion these empty balloons have clogged up their sewer system.</text>

            <text syncTime="925.258" offset="3840487">Not only the centralized activities, but this incredible logistics task of pulling out, sometimes with an order telling you who it is only the night before and which court he's going to only the night before, 1,000 inmates, one-fifth of the jail's population, that have to be commingled by court destination and transported out to these courts and brought back again at night on a daily basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.295" offset="3972562">The significance of that is that even if you found some inmates that could be trustworthy, and no doubt there are many, that you can't preclude the use of coercion and threats by those with a compulsion to obtain the drugs to coerce these people permitted contact visits to do their deeds for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.245" offset="4060438">And these prison drug trafficking-oriented gangs are a major problem in that respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="986.932" offset="4087082">But I think another thing about contact visitation that we have to think about is that the necessary security measures for it are very intrusive and have adverse effects on the inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.158" offset="4144029">Justice Marshall well pointed out that these strip searches, which are almost universally determined to be necessary with contact visitation, may themselves have adverse psychological impact upon the inmate, that they're certainly degrading, and that they may present the potential--</text>

            <text syncTime="1025.923" offset="4243086">Also, contact visitation is more protracted, time consuming, and personnel intensive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1034.027" offset="4275478">It may limit the number of non-contact visits that we can permit to other inmates, and may take immediate personnel away from other important duties within the jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1046.203" offset="4324170">Finally, the jail was not designed for contact visitation, and if we were forced to try and deal with such an order it's clear that rather expensive and complex additional construction would be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.344" offset="4380803">Two decades of prisoner' rights litigation have taught us that the problems of jails are difficult and intractable and not easily solved by judicial decree, and this is because they involve sensitive judgments concerning the confinement of people against their will, to many of whom violence is no stranger, and where the compulsion to obtain narcotics and other contraband may override rationality, and most importantly, were the cost of miscalculation may be human life in its forfeit instant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1595.153" offset="6520023">Perhaps Mr. Bennett can clarify that on his rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.604" offset="6529845">The trial court first found, following the teachings of Wolfish, that the total prohibition on contact visits was an exaggerated response by County officials to security concerns, which the trial court found to be punishment in violation of the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.434" offset="6613123">Also going through this issue are the fact that the total prohibition results in unconstitutional interference with important familial rights of detainees and their families, following a long line of Fourteenth Amendment cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.230" offset="6684281">On the first argument, Wolfish teaches us that a detainee has the right to be free of any punishment, and whether a condition or practice, the total prohibition in this case, is punishment is essentially a factual question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.155" offset="6744049">The County argues that to find inferred punitive intent you must have a condition that on its face appears punitive and the condition must be very harsh, and they refer to footnote 20 in Justice Rehnquist's opinion in Wolfish, the example of loading a chain with detainees in shackles and placing them in a dungeon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.688" offset="6842165">In other words, they argue for a return to the hands-off doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.091" offset="6859719">That assertion I submit flies in the face of the facts of this case, the example I gave you of Mr. Rutherford before, and historical facts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1699.903" offset="6939027">So that we have to analyze it in terms of someone who has been there 35 days as well as someone who's been there 39 months.</text>

            <text syncTime="1705.957" offset="6963269">--That's precisely what the district court did, and if you'll notice, the district court in its original order provided that detainees there only 14 days were entitled to visits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.432" offset="7005169">Then... that's after the 17-day trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.049" offset="7015618">Then, on the County's application, the court held another four-day hearing, took further evidence on the contact visit issue, and made a factual finding that 30 days would be more appropriate, to accommodate the County's concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.159" offset="7076013">But many practices that historically started for valid reasons, as I started to say, are today punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.249" offset="7108405">We know that the penitentiary in this country was started by the Quakers for rehabilitative purposes, and their concept was that you lock people up in silence and in solitude for many years and that they would become penitent and be rehabilitated, and of course most of them went mad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1758.925" offset="7175069">Today we would characterize that treatment as punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.226" offset="7188340">Corporal punishment and whipping was common in our prisons for deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1767.130" offset="7207879">It was a benign thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.399" offset="7216970">We would deter bad conduct by publicly whipping a person.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.768" offset="7230449">Now, of course, we would consider that punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1775.136" offset="7239958">It is true, as the Court said in Wolfish, that effective management and security concerns are legitimate government interests that may justify certain conditions or restrictions on detainees, the kinds of things that Mr. Bennett was talking about, and that the Court should ordinarily defer to corrections officials in the absence... this language from Wolfish... in the absence of substantial evidence in the record which indicates that the officials have exaggerated their response.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.905" offset="7359076">In other words, the deference is not absolute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.607" offset="7369838">It is true that contact visits, like any other practice, present a security problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.095" offset="7391781">But as Judge Duffey said in the Boudin case I referred to before:</text>

            <text syncTime="2613.198" offset="10592199">"It is inescapable that, in the words of the Supreme Court, the County's action was excessive in relation to the alternative purpose of security assigned. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.636" offset="10629920">"The deprivations exceeded the reasonable requirements of security. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.355" offset="10644862">"To deprive a prisoner for long periods of time of any opportunity to embrace his wife or hug his children is very traumatic treatment, and such treatment is not made necessary by reasonable security requirements. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.848" offset="10702749">"It constitutes severe punishment. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2642.633" offset="10709959">As to the rights specifically of wives and children, those important familial rights, protected by the many decisions of this Court, those fundamental values we would argue should be measured by an even stricter test than that which is set forth under the due process clause in Wolfish, but under the kind of test that Procunier versus Martinez suggests: if the complete elimination of the opportunity to touch their loved ones is greater than necessary or essential to the protection of the governmental interest involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.121" offset="10847886">In closing on this issue, I would just ask you to visualize, as I think the trial judge did, to visualize a person who is a father or a grandchild behind a glass wall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2695.685" offset="10922178">For months or even years, you can see but not touch that child.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.654" offset="10942031">I would find that, as I said earlier, not just punishment; I would find that torture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.373" offset="10964914">Let me turn very briefly to the other issue, which I recognize at the outset is a closer question, the cell search issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.681" offset="11010158">But let me redefine or correct the impression that was left earlier about what that order says.</text>
            <text syncTime="2726.721" offset="11046312">It is not an order that says that any prisoner has the right to observe a cell search of his cell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.227" offset="11080271">What it says is that any prisoner who is in the area may, under these very specific provisions, observe the cell search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.950" offset="11123216">So that a prisoner who is in the dining room or at recreation or out at court or visiting and they want to search his cell, they don't have to go get that person and bring him back.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.342" offset="11168774">The protection was, if the prisoner happens to be in the cell or right on that block of cells and is there, then there was this special accommodation to allow the prisoner to observe the cell search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2773.852" offset="11234811">And this is a procedural due process issue, as Judge Gray dealt with it, rather than freedom from punishment as a matter of substantive due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.458" offset="11273264">And he distinguished from Wolfish, which was decided basically on Fourth Amendment grounds.</text>

            <text syncTime="2839.294" offset="11496558">Well, what he found was that, I think, that it was not a search and seizure question, but since we have already determined that a prisoner does... that the state may not take property without some procedural due process, he found that if those things were taken there was no adequate procedural protection, such as the damage claim mentioned by footnote 38 in Wolfish; and that under Parratt v. Taylor, which reaffirms that a state may not take property without some sort of hearing or, as the Court said in Parratt, a meaningful hearing at a meaningful time, the only time to do that is in a prophylactic way, to prevent the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.489" offset="11669385">I think that was his analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.025" offset="11675549">But he clearly limited it, I think because of Wolfish, to those prisoners in the immediate area of the cell search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.012" offset="11707419">He did not strike down the search rule in its entirety, which is what was at issue in Wolfish.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.166" offset="11732078">He found, after evidence and personal observation, that the risks of improper confiscation of cherished possessions was great and could not be redressed in any future action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2908.390" offset="11772934">That was the basis for his ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.342" offset="11784741">I submit, I agree that it is a closer question because the facts are so close to the Wolfish case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.496" offset="11809401">But I think, for all of the reasons that I have set forth, this Court should affirm the decision of the Ninth Circuit.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frederick R. Bennett</label>
            <text syncTime="2931.054" offset="11863631">I'd like to direct my attention just briefly to this 39-month inmate, because it may cause some concern to some members of the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2944.064" offset="11915667">There's nothing in the record to indicate that's a routine or other than an exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.467" offset="11937296">And I point out that every one of these pretrial inmates is before a judge in a pending criminal case, which regularly makes orders concerning confinement and the treatment of that prisoner during trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.810" offset="11994661">What's significant about that is one portion of the record that's easy to overlook, and it's set forth on page 62 of the joint appendix, and it was a fact stipulated to between the parties at the outset of the litigation, and it reads:</text>
            <text syncTime="2982.605" offset="12069789">"Physical contact between prisoners and visitors is not routinely permitted. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.127" offset="12103958">Not routinely permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.412" offset="12113048">We do get orders from judges in cases that are particularly protracted, that are handled on a one on one basis, which is manageable within our facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3006.637" offset="12165920">In fact, I'm not sure if it appears in the transcript or not, but I was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.576" offset="12197685">Judge Gray himself ordered some such visits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.112" offset="12215866">I can't remember if it dealt with Mr. Rutherford himself, but with regard to one inmate who made such a request.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.984" offset="12247318">In conclusion, we do argue that the Court as a matter of law should not find contact visits constitutionally required; given the unavoidable risks, given the availability of relatively risk-free alternatives, that the Court should not find that a court is warranted in substituting its judgment either for the jailer who operates that jail or for the local and state officials and government for which they work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.179" offset="12428085">New York is a prime example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3074.198" offset="12436235">It has gone far beyond constitutional mandates and has indicated that that may occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.202" offset="12464238">With regard to the findings, as we've indicated in our brief I don't think the findings of the court support either its conclusions or the position of the inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.212" offset="12524216">It's clear when you compare the three decisions that the court merely substituted its perception of what was reasonable for that of the sheriff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.670" offset="12570087">When you look at the first initial decision, the court looked at two different tests: a compelling necessity test that came out of the New York courts, which required strict scrutiny; and it then looked at the reasonably necessary test, which came out of another circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.016" offset="12647514">And it said even then, between those two tests, at the petition appendix page 30, that even those two tests were the same, that only they differed in theoretical analysis, but the result was the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3146.378" offset="12724940">Still a balancing test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.763" offset="12734449">When you get to the final decision after remand after Wolfish, the court no longer talks about the compelling necessity test, but he talks about his prior test and he says, even the test of Wolfish and what I did before is the same, that really... and that was at the appendix 25.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.295" offset="12828594">Whether you're talking about the compelling necessity test, strict scrutiny, the reasonably necessary test, or the test of Wolfish, the court says, I read the tests the same and the result is the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.122" offset="12887945">And what that tells us is that the court worked in reverse order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3190.657" offset="12902051">He first looked at his perception of what was an appropriate way to deal with this problem of permitting inmates to maintain personal relationships, and worked backwards to try to make the test fit that result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3207.035" offset="12967566">And really, the one thing that Wolfish tells us is that you go in reverse order.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.272" offset="12992539">You first look at the determination of the jailer or of the local entity or state government for which he works, and you examine his choice of the range of reasonable solutions and see if it is sufficiently related to legitimate government goals that it's not punishment and thus constitutionally permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.356" offset="13092849">And with that, I will submit.</text>
