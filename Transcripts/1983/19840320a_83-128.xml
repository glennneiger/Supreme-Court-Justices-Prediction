            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="155241">Mr. Frey, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="53.033" stopTime="138.824">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="53.033" offset="367355">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="57.020" offset="383238">In this case the Court has under review a judgment of the Ninth Circuit reversing respondents' convictions for brutal murders committed while they were inmates at the Federal correctional institution in Lompos, California, and ordering dismissal of the indictments against them on the ground that they were denied their Sixth Amendment right to the assistance of counsel when they were held in administrative detention for more than 90 days after the killings, when that detention was, in the court's view, based in part on the pendency of a criminal investigation by the FBI for the murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.295" offset="536420">Now essentially while there are differences in the case, the two groups of cases, the Gouveia group and the Mills group, followed a similar pattern.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.683" offset="577902">There was a murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.435" offset="580932">Either immediately after the murder or within several weeks thereafter the respondents who were inmates at the prison were confined in administrative detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.927" offset="630879">Within several weeks of that prison disciplinary hearings were held and they were adjudicated to have violated the prison regulations against murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.449" offset="672988">They were then confined in the administrative detention unit until the time they were indicted, some months later.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="138.824" offset="710500">Were they free to communicate with the outside?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="141.693" stopTime="296.076">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="141.693" offset="721994">They were free to make phone calls to the outside, to lawyers or to others.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.212" offset="748012">In fact, two of the individuals involved called the public defender and asked for their assistance and were told that they couldn't because they had not yet been indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.022" offset="807257">So they were free to communicate with the outside world, including communicating with lawyers.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.693" offset="834007">They were eventually indicted, and at that point they were transferred for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.597" offset="857621">In the Mills case, motions to dismiss were made and although the ground that is now the issue before the Court was not raised by respondents Mills and Pierce the District Court in granting the motion said that their right to counsel had been denied and dismissed the indictment on that ground, among others.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.997" offset="959185">The government took an interlocutory appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.766" offset="970261">A panel of the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.485" offset="985099">In the Gouveia case, the District Court denied the motion for relief in which all the grounds that had been relied on by the District Court in Mills were raised by the Gouveia group of defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.911" offset="1042882">And in Mills there was one trial after the remand from the Court of Appeals; the defendants were convicted and appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.748" offset="1070154">In Gouveia there was a trial that resulted in a hung jury as to the present respondents, an acquittal of co-defendant Flores, and an acquittal of respondent Reynoso on one lesser count.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.322" offset="1120518">Those defendants also appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.674" offset="1133892">The two cases were consolidated and heard by an en banc panel of the Ninth Circuit, which held that the convictions should be reversed and the indictments dismissed.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.068" offset="1183421">Now as we see it, the case presents one primary and one secondary issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.553" offset="1205363">The primary issue is whether respondents' right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment attached prior to the time of the commencement of judicial proceedings against them by indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.629" offset="1257713">If this Court disagrees with the Ninth Circuit and finds, as we urge, that the right to counsel did not attach prior to that time, that would be the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.303" offset="1304420">If the Court agrees with the Ninth Circuit that their right to counsel attached, then there would be the further question as to whether there was a sufficient showing of prejudice.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="296.076" stopTime="302.130">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="296.076" offset="1339528">Excuse me, Mr. Frey.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.993" offset="1343185">The time of indictment is the time for appointment?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="302.130" stopTime="439.269">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="302.130" offset="1363665">In this particular case, the time of indictment is the time that we say that the right of appointment of counsel attaches, the right to assistance of counsel and for indigents appointment of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.287" offset="1416328">Now given the time limitations, I'd like to focus my attention in my opening argument on the primary issue of the attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.843" offset="1462513">Now the first and most obvious point about the attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is that it does derive from the Sixth Amendment, and the Sixth Amendment says in any criminal prosecution the accused shall enjoy the right to the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.638" offset="1533775">There must be, then, something that the Court can say is a criminal prosecution before, I think, the Court can legitimately say that the right defined in the Sixth Amendment has attached.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.964" offset="1591035">The second obstacle to respondents' position and the Court of Appeals position is that this Court has a consistent line of decisions in which it has recognized the significance of the need for their to be a prosecution in existence, and it has in the context of Miranda as against Massiah rights or in the context of whether a lineup without counsel claim or presents a due process or a right to counsel claim, it has consistently looked at the question whether there is some kind of charge against the defendant charging him with the crime filed in a court somewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.845" offset="1770549">Of course, in this case there is nothing remotely like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.963" offset="1783088">The sole exception to this line of cases is the Escobedo case, which the Court has subsequently held to be limited to its facts and plainly rejected in its rationale in the later decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.557" offset="1841393">And I would just point out about Escobedo that that was a case that at least directly involved an interference by the police between the defendant and his retained counsel, who was down at the station house trying to to get in to see him and was not permitted to see him while he was being interrogated.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="439.269" stopTime="439.769">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="439.269" offset="1912237">Out in the hallway.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="439.769" stopTime="578.157">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="439.769" offset="1914222">So it's understandable, perhaps, that the Court thought the right to counsel would be relevant there, although I think subsequently doctrinally it's become quite clear that it wasn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.024" offset="1959257">Now, as I said, there is no dispute in this case that there was nothing resembling a formal judicial charge of any kind prior to indictment, and the rule has been, I think, fairly clear and fairly easy to administer as to when Sixth Amendment rights attach.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.686" offset="2029892">The Court of Appeals, however, has basically thrown us into seas of uncertainty by developing a concept of the functional equivalency of a prosecution or an accusation, and stating that "whether a person stands accused"... and I'm quoting from their opinion...</text>
            <text syncTime="490.449" offset="2117037">"can only be determined from the totality of the circumstances. "</text>
            <text syncTime="495.336" offset="2136577">Now I hope this Court will decline the invitation to set sail in these murky waters.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.173" offset="2167923">Now let's... let me talk for a minute about what the Court of Appeals thought would satisfy the Sixth Amendment requirement that there be a prosecution in being or the functional equivalent of a formal accusation of the defendants for a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.454" offset="2249008">It held that the retention in administrative detention unit for more than 90 days, where part of the reason for that detention is the pendency of a criminal investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.948" offset="2314941">Now respondents Mills and Pierce, perhaps fearing that the Court would find the breadth of that rule somewhat difficult to accept, have proposed a considerably narrower principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.827" offset="2386516">They assert that the rule of the Ninth Circuit is only that where people are detained more than 90 days with no legitimate security purpose but solely because of the pendency of a criminal investigation by the FBI, then they should be considered accused within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="578.157" stopTime="586.427">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="578.157" offset="2467809">But fear was part of the administrative detention for the security of other inmates and staff of the prison?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="586.427" stopTime="595.233">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="586.427" offset="2500932">Well, I think our position, of course, is that that is exactly what the administrative detention is for, is for purposes of security, and I do--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="595.233" stopTime="599.171">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="595.233" offset="2536145">Well, wasn't that expressed in the process?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="599.171" stopTime="836.558">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="599.171" offset="2551923">--Well, there is some... there is some controversy over exactly what the record shows or what the Court of Appeals could decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.842" offset="2586510">I might point out that the time that Mills and Pierce made their motions in the District Court the only Sixth Amendment right to counsel claim that they made was a claim that they were entitled to have counsel there the day that they were arrested, when their physical wounds were examined, and when evidence was seized from their person.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.273" offset="2672296">There was no claim that they were deprived of their right to counsel during the period of detention, and there was really no focus during the hearings on the pretrial motions on the question of why they were being detained, although there was considerable focus in both cases on the consequences of detention in terms of the difficulty of ultimately mounting a defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.186" offset="2759963">The result is that the record contains very little as to why they were detained, but it does contain forms that state that the reason that they were detained was for the security of the institution and the safety of inmates within the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.450" offset="2840942">Some of those forms also indicate that they were... there are boxes that can be checked off and the pendency of a criminal investigation was also a reason given on those forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.210" offset="2899979">Now, when the case went up to the panel of the Court of Appeals on the government's appeal, that was the first time that this question of why they were being detained, whether it was for security purposes or others, was brought into focus by the parties, and at that point the panel simply said the evidence shows that they were kept in for security purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.760" offset="3006245">And, more than that... and this is a point where I think the Court of Appeals made a fundamental error... the Court of Appeals misconstrued the Bureau's regulations and the regulation that's relevant is at Section 541.22 of Title 28, CFR.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.421" offset="3072910">The regulation says that people can be retained, placed in administrative detention when the inmate's continued presence in the general population poses a serious threat to life, property, self, staff, other inmates, or to the security or orderly running of the institution, and when the inmate... and then it lists six factors, including the pendency of an investigation or trial for a criminal act, the pendency of a transfer, and several other factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.258" offset="3192237">These regulations mean that an inmate cannot be held in administrative detention except where there is a finding that releasing him into the general population would be inconsistent with the security of the institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.834" offset="3250542">The only exception for that holdover is inmates who are in transit from one institution to another and are being held waiting for the next bus, and they can be held and customarily are in administrative detention without a finding of security need.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.629" offset="3321700">So under the regulations they cannot be held except on the basis of a security need.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.283" offset="3348345">And I might say that in this case it does not take a great deal of imagination to see the security reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.556" offset="3385439">The prison authorities had found that these people had committed brutal murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.042" offset="3407381">To return these inmates to the general population at Lompoc was, I think, totally out of the question both in terms of the safety of these inmates themselves, who might be subject to retaliation by friends of the deceased, and in terms of the safety of potential government witnesses or informants or people who they might think are government witnesses or informants.</text>

            <text syncTime="1448.131" offset="5947737">I don't agree with the basic assumption that it's no good to have a lawyer later on and you need one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.468" offset="5977099">In fact, going back to the point that Justice Rehnquist made, it can't be that the Court of Appeals is saying you need the specialized talents of a lawyer in this situation, which is what the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is about, if it would be a satisfactory substitute for that to let them just back into the prison population to conduct their own investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.500" offset="6065184">Just as you would not say if you had a defendant who was arrested and indicted and released on bail and then his lawyer became ill and no substitute lawyer was appointed for him until the morning of trial, nobody would entertain a claim that he was out and he could conduct his own investigation, he didn't need a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.525" offset="6129341">The point is that once he is going to be tried he needs a lawyer and we supply him a lawyer at critical stages of the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.029" offset="6159329">But prior to that time he does not have a right to a lawyer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1563.019" offset="6407283">There is such a thing as... pre-indictment plea negotiation does go on, not in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.756" offset="6434242">I don't think that's very practical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.289" offset="6440302">What... in the real world, what happens is it's very important to have that indictment or information or charge because that's when the lawyer knows what the government's case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.613" offset="6497667">At that point he does get some discovery, gets physical evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.080" offset="6511460">He gets his client's prior statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1590.980" offset="6519088">If he starts doing a very active investigation before then, one of the reasons why it's not common is he may only put himself in a position where he is handicapped in representing his client once he knows what the government is actually charging him with and what his case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.159" offset="6583871">So even where the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches for purposes of a preliminary hearing, a bail hearing, and so on, it is simply not the fact that the lawyer immediately goes out and starts investigating the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.767" offset="6634235">They may or they may not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.202" offset="6639982">It may or may not be helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.502" offset="6649177">Our position here does not depend on any conclusion that it would have been useless to these respondents to have lawyers, but I think they greatly exaggerate the value that it would have been to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.376" offset="6696720">Now I wanted also to make just one other point, which is that their emphasis on the utility of a lawyer, even if you accept it, does not put them in any different position from lots of other people, such as people who get in a serious automobile accident and are in a hospital for six months while the government is investigating their case, people who are arrested on other charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.848" offset="6822630">And I believe Mr. Levine is going to argue this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.033" offset="6831303">I am told he had a client who was in precisely that situation... arrested on state charges, put in a state prison, and meanwhile a federal investigation was going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.638" offset="6869755">Or if we had let these folks out of jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.007" offset="6883234">If their mandatory release date had come, they would not have been held in administrative detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.144" offset="6899744">They would have been released.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.111" offset="6903610">They would have been just as unable to conduct an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.963" offset="6919074">One other point I wanted to make, and that is that the whole code of guilt rationale falls down if you look at what they did with respondent Gouveia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.769" offset="6954288">He was transferred within 90 days out of ADU in Lompoc and sent to Levenworth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1706.056" offset="6979365">There was no question that he was being held in ADU as some kind of symbolic accusation of the crime of murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.711" offset="7006010">He was transferred to Levenworth, and they still dismissed the indictment against him.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles P. Diamond</label>
            <text syncTime="1724.953" offset="7055016">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1727.305" offset="7064420">In the time allotted to me to address the right to counsel issue I would like to make four principal points concerning the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.077" offset="7103499">First, the decision does not limit the right of the government to order an inmate into segregated confinement or to hold him there indefinitely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.100" offset="7135577">It simply recognizes that under limited circumstances an inmate can be rendered an accused by that confinement and under limited circumstances is entitled to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.824" offset="7182493">The government does not point to any adverse consequences which could flow from that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.659" offset="7201824">Point two, the decision of the Court of Appeals fully accommodates the interests of the government in responding promptly to disruptive events.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.398" offset="7240799">Indeed, it only pertains to those who have been held under Bureau of Prisons' own regulations to answer in a pending criminal indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.390" offset="7280714">In that respect, the decision of the Court of Appeals is far less rigorous than standards that have been promulgated by the American Bar Association and other legal groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.812" offset="7322405">Point three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.580" offset="7329510">The Court of Appeals did not require the appointment of counsel for all inmates confined in administrative detention for more than 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.286" offset="7368381">Contrary to what Mr. Frey says about this case, this case concerns only inmates who have been detained to answer in pending criminal charges and thus who in a constitutional sense have been accused of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.479" offset="7429089">Point four.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.581" offset="7433478">The decision below does not represent any radical departure from anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.483" offset="7453122">It simply stands for the proposition that those arrested within the walls of a prison are as much entitled to legal representation as those who are arrested outside the walls of an institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.475" offset="7505053">In light of Mr. Frey's comments, I'd like to diverge from the order in which I was going to cover these points and plunge right into the constitutional basis for what the Court of Appeals did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.764" offset="7550297">That really goes to the third point that I wanted to cover this morning in that the Court of Appeals recognized a right to counsel only in inmates who have been held in a constitutional sense because they have been accused of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1864.193" offset="7611946">What the Court of Appeals looked to were the Bureau of Prison regulations which state an inmate can be detained indefinitely... and in this case we have up to 20 months of detention... without a lawyer while he is pending criminal investigation and trial for a criminal act committed in the institution.</text>

            <text syncTime="2694.960" offset="10935035">It is a secondary issue, the issue being the remedy that was fashioned by the Ninth Circuit, only in the sense that if there is no right to counsel, as has been discussed by Mr. Diamond, then there is really no need to discuss what the remedy should be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.706" offset="11010059">However, I think as a prefatory remark I should state to the Court that if there were no prejudice as pervasive as existed in this case there would be no need for us all to be standing here discussing whether the right to counsel should apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.633" offset="11073693">And as we weave our way through ten appellate briefs and the oral arguments that have been heard here today I think that one thing becomes apparent, and that is throughout all those arguments nobody has suggested an alternate remedy that works.</text>

            <text syncTime="2800.146" offset="11355816">Really the attempt to bifurcate these two issues is probably a little unfair to this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="2871.758" offset="11642222">But we are dealing with defendants who are indigent, who did not have the ability to retain an attorney either at the time of these murders or 20 months later.</text>

            <text syncTime="2898.893" offset="11750787">He further needed to ask for an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2901.511" offset="11761236">And if he was held outside the general prison population for a period in excess of 90 days then Judge Sneed said, with the majority of the court, that he would either have to be released to the population of the prison or afforded an attorney.</text>

            <text syncTime="2970.441" offset="12036985">In that inmate population are going to be, especially if he is released within a relatively short period of time from the murder, are going to be persons who may know something about the murder, who may know something about the witnesses the government is going to call, and who may also know something about other persons who, let's say, had a grudge against the decedent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3418.021" offset="13827313">When we talk about the potential prejudice or prejudice, as the Morrison case discusses, when you have six people who are serving life plus 99 years in prison, the claims of prejudice begin to get your attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.597" offset="13885618">And in this particular case I think the Solicitor General's office is beginning to take a rather inconsistent position when you hear them argue in the case immediately preceding this that it is the government's interest to bring people to trial while the evidence is new and the memories of witnesses are clear and in this particular case they seem not to have very much concern for that position, and that's our position, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="3494.955" offset="14135035">And I think it's a very, very good illustration of how fast the government really does come up with their evidence in one of these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.192" offset="14163979">Maybe they don't do it within 90 days, maybe they don't do it within 45 days, but when they... when a murder occurs at an institution such as Lompoc what happens is the FBI goes out and interviews perhaps half, if not more than half, of the prison population.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="3640.996" offset="14719133">I think they all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.046" offset="14723417">I'm not certain what the sentences were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.631" offset="14729687">I assume they all got life sentences for these murders.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.250" offset="14740240">No, Pierce in fact was, after the indictment was dismissed and while the government was appealing, his mandatory release date came up and he was let out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.189" offset="14779946">He robbed some banks in northern California and he's in state custody now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.326" offset="14796456">So if the mandatory release date comes, this symbolic accusation evaporates and they are let out of prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.180" offset="14827907">It's the prison authorities who decide to put them in administrative detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.667" offset="14849850">It is not the FBI and not the prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3675.935" offset="14858941">It is not a foregone conclusion that there will be a prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3679.004" offset="14871166">In this case, we have a statement by the assistant that as to Mr. Levine's client, Mr. Segura, it was only several months before the indictment was returned that he felt he had a prosecutable case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3690.179" offset="14915888">They have based much of their argument on a witness named Giffin, an individual named Giffin, who gave us information about the murders, who was going to be our main witness, and he didn't testify at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.503" offset="14969177">Fortunately Mr. Kinard, one of the co-defendants did, but we would not have had a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.257" offset="14992165">These cases are very fragile.</text>
            <text syncTime="3710.926" offset="14998852">We may be quite confident that people are guilty, but that is not enough to justify returning an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.329" offset="15020482">We have to be able to secure convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3719.381" offset="15032707">I wanted to make one point about the District Court's finding with regard to the lack of a security basis for the detention of these people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.137" offset="15067711">That is tucked away in a conclusion of law, not a finding of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3733.122" offset="15087669">It was not an issue in this case at all until the Court of Appeals, when it was really raised by Mr. Diamond, refuted by us in our reply brief in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3742.997" offset="15127166">The panel of the Court of Appeals ruled in our favor and said there was a security basis, which, as I say, under the regulations has to be there, and under the... what evidence there was showed that there was a security basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.554" offset="15181396">Now it is true that they were under investigation for a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.589" offset="15193517">We don't deny that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.441" offset="15200936">We do deny, however, if there were a hearing I think we could plainly establish that that was not a necessary condition for their detention.</text>

            <text syncTime="3771.247" offset="15240224">Mr. Frey, if one of these people had plenty of money and apart from prison regulations, would he have had a constitutional right to retain counsel of his choice before indictment?</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="3782.372" offset="15284632">Well, I kind of discussed that a little bit back in December in the Flanagan case, but that would sound to me something like a substantive due process right, and I am not sure what this Court would find.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.564" offset="15345445">There would be a decent argument, I think, that if somebody wants to retain a lawyer it is the kind of associational interest in running one's own affairs that the government could no arbitrarily interfere with or prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.756" offset="15394242">The point about the Gulag business, about holding people indefinitely without a lawyer, of course, raises a due process claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3818.562" offset="15429455">You can't hold people indefinitely, not because of their right to counsel but because they can't be deprived of their liberty without due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.282" offset="15456309">So, therefore, in order to hold them there must be a charge and a judicial findings and a judicial proceeding.</text>

            <text syncTime="3849.999" offset="15555156">Well, I want to make a point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3851.366" offset="15560694">The Court of Appeals said in its opinion that holding them in ADU was equivalent to an arrest because it serves the important need of investigative officers to protect witnesses and evidence, facilitate an effective investigation, prevent further criminal activity by the suspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3868.495" offset="15629135">And it said these are the interests that lead to an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3872.430" offset="15644913">Well, the Court of Appeals, I think it forgot about bail.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.965" offset="15655048">That is not the purpose of an arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3877.850" offset="15666542">That is preventive detention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3879.302" offset="15672394">We don't generally have that in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3882.404" offset="15684828">Most arrests are not for the purpose of preventive detention, but they may lead to the institution of a judicial proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3890.576" offset="15717533">That is a different story.</text>
            <text syncTime="3892.393" offset="15724743">In this case we do have preventive detention which is perfectly legitimate in the context of the prison situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3899.516" offset="15753269">It is not an accusation of a crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.132" offset="15759747">There is no prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.101" offset="15767584">No right to counsel.</text>
