            <text syncTime="72.000" offset="425069">This 1983 due process case arose out of the firing of an employee of the Florida Highway Patrol in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.154" offset="457670">Although the district court ultimately held that the law regarding pre-termination due process was not clearly established at the time of the firing, it nevertheless continued on and ruled that the Florida statute, Chapter 110, was unconstitutional in that it violated post-termination due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.189" offset="557771">It also continued on and found that the employee was entitled to damages under 1983 not for any violation of clearly established constitutional law, but because the defendants did not follow a departmental regulation recently enacted in terminating this employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="341.370" offset="1502568">The facts are somewhat convoluted, but essentially the employee Scherer requested permission to work a second job with the Escambia County Sheriff's Department in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.694" offset="1555857">That permission was erroneously granted when a letter that the captain had instructed his secretary not to mail was mailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.469" offset="1598907">The employee immediately went out and bought a handgun and a uniform and proceeded work.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.360" offset="1626493">A couple of weeks later the captain found that the employee was working, went back, found out that the letter had been inadvertently mailed; and he was instructed, both orally and in writing, to cease his second job because there was a potential for a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.274" offset="1698173">He was a radio teletype operator, not a trooper.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.645" offset="1715622">There were only six radio teletype operators in that particular troop in Pensacola, and they worked around the clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.769" offset="1756164">The troopers in that particular... in the Highway Patrol were the beneficiaries of a collective bargaining agreement with the Police Benevolent Association by which troopers could work second jobs, and their employers, the Highway Patrol, were required to allow them to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.666" offset="1847697">No such benefit was accorded to the radio teletype operators or to other administrative support personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.226" offset="1881970">But in any event, he continued his second job, the sergeant found out about it and advised him that he was in violation of the captain's orders to cease his second job.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.671" offset="1935678">And the record is clear that there were numerous conferences on this point and that he refused to terminate his second job.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.415" offset="1974653">He was stating I don't see any reason for a conflict, not that one did or did not exist... that's not the point... but whether he didn't see one.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.240" offset="2009970">And as a result of his not seeing it, although he had been told to cease his job, refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.770" offset="2052079">This was reported up through channels.</text>

            <text syncTime="776.743" offset="3243995">And the court found in analyzing 1983 that because the state, or in this case an agency of the state, had promulgated a regulation, that that was a sufficient basis under 1983 to award damages for a violation which... of... of state law and state regulation and not of any clearly established constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.275" offset="3366143">Now, the court originally found that there was a right that was there, but they retreated from that in a subsequent opinion in June of 1982 which was announced a couple of weeks before the Harlow.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.709" offset="3411910">So admittedly, the district court did not have the wisdom of this Court in the Harlow decision, but... and Harlow did away with the subjective prong and looked to was the violation of the law clearly established, and was it clearly established constitutional law, not state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="843.920" offset="3512742">Because you looked to the decision of Procunier v. Navarette, and there was an allegation in that case that prison officials had violated clearly established state law and regulations regarding the prison mailing regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.596" offset="3599469">And the Court specifically rejected that as a finding and found that the law had to be one that was clearly established and was under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.217" offset="3645862">Now, to look at the law and in preparing for this case I came across an admonition of former Solicitor General and dean Irwin Griswold, and his statement to his students was look to the law; and when we look to the law, we find 1983, and it says that... that the individuals will be subject to the... within the jurisdiction thereof the deprivation of any rights, privileges or immunities secured by the Constitution and the laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.888" offset="3792566">And it's our contention that the laws therein do not address state laws but rather federal laws, because this act, the Civil Rights Act of 1871, was designed and directed toward the abrogation of state... by states of the rights secured by the Constitution, particularly under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Wilkins</label>
            <text syncTime="1112.010" offset="4585121">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.635" offset="4595570">In defining the contours of the concept of qualified official immunity, this Court has attempted to balance two important but competing interests: the right of the individual to a remedy for a constitutional wrong against the necessity of protecting public officials from the hazards of litigation so as to prevent undue disruption in the conduct of public affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.969" offset="4688879">Beginning with the Court's first case in this area, in Pierson v. Ray, and continuing through its decision in Butz v. Ecnomou, it accommodated these interests by casting the qualified immunity defense as a wide-ranging inquiry into the subjective and objective good faith of the defendant public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.161" offset="4769650">In Harlow, however, relying on the past experience of the federal courts... that is, in Harlow v. Fitzgerald... the Court recast the qualified immunity doctrine as a single, strictly legal inquiry that turned on one factor; that is, the Court extended immunity to public officials unless they violated clearly established rights of which a reasonable person would have known.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.325" offset="4870378">The Court left little doubt why it was so dramatically restructuring the doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.215" offset="4889918">It did so because the prior test had rarely resulted in the dismissal of claims prior to actual litigation because it turned on so many evidentiary variables.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.644" offset="4935580">The new test was specifically designed to permit the disposition of immunity claims without the necessity of subjecting all public officials to discovery and trial on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.815" offset="4984272">The question... the important question presented here that's left in this case at this point is whether or not the Court will remain with the position so recently taken in Harlow, or whether the qualified immunity test will once more evolve into a consideration of multiple factors, thereby robbing the test of the ability to settle litigation prior to actual discovery or trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.974" offset="5092942">In this case, the Appellee entered federal district court with a claim that he'd been denied due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.190" offset="5117810">Although the district court ultimately concluded that he was denied no clearly established due process right... although I would reply to one of the questions from the bench I think it's clear from the decision that he found that under current law the statute would be... would be violated now, or the Constitution had been violated in the current provisions, although in 1977 when he'd been dismissed it wasn't clearly established at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.178" offset="5217807">He nevertheless or the court nevertheless denied the Appellants qualified immunity, and it did so by citing what it called the totality of the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.111" offset="5273500">It said looking at all the facts in the record, I see that there was a violation of a regulatory provision here that renders their conduct unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.359" offset="5306519">Unreasonable conduct is not eligible for qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.434" offset="5322819">That sort of analysis, of course, has some force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.260" offset="5338075">Indeed, it was the analysis that prevailed prior to Harlow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.088" offset="5353435">But it was specifically rejected by this Court in Harlow, and the Court made clear in that case that immunity would no longer depend upon an analysis of the totality of the circumstances, but rather whether or not there was allegation of clearly established rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="1320.720" offset="5419890">Counsel, would it be... would you make the same argument if the administrative regulation were perfectly clear, so that you could objectively say we don't have the problems we have in a subjective analysis or totality of the facts on summary judgment?</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Wilkins</label>
            <text syncTime="1335.514" offset="5479136">Yes, we would, Justice Stevens, for one important question... for one important reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.339" offset="5498362">It becomes extremely difficult, even when you say the regulation is very clear, to keep the analysis from going beyond the narrow bounds set in Harlow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.757" offset="5544024">And let me try and explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.052" offset="5549248">It is a little difficult.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.112" offset="5553533">What... what the Court did in Harlow was not say that good faith is irrelevant to qualified immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.329" offset="5586342">The Court simply concluded that the benefits of making qualified immunity depend upon proof of absolute good faith, were simply not worth the cost of subjecting all public officials to discovery and trial on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.026" offset="5653111">Now, the Appellee's argument here, and the only argument that really can be made in support of the approach below, is that a violation of a regulatory or statutory provision demonstrates the absence of good faith but does so in a way that doesn't incur the kinds of costs associated with the approach prior to Harlow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.016" offset="5749137">And so taking from your question, the argument would be well, when they're clear, isn't that really a cost-free means of determining the absence of good faith?</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.916" offset="5792710">We don't think that's so at all for this reason: when... when a public official violates a clearly established constitutional right, we think that it can be fairly assumed or it can be fairly... that conduct can be fairly described as lacking in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.522" offset="5863136">After all, if it's a clearly described constitutional rule, the public official should be aware and should not transgress it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.202" offset="5897826">However, the same thing cannot be said with regarding to the vast majority of regulatory or statutory provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.404" offset="5926666">They're rarely as clearly established as constitutional provisions once they're announced by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.449" offset="5950803">Indeed, in this case the Appellants had the advice of counsel before they dismissed the Appellee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.366" offset="5978493">The district court looking even at all the conduct in this case said that they acted in ultimate... in... in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.100" offset="6005451">As we describe in our brief, even with clearly established sorts of provisions, there are all kinds of reasons why a public official might or might not comply with the provision in a given circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1479.813" offset="6056337">Also, it's very difficult for a court to determine after the fact whether or not something really was clearly established in the heat of battle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.325" offset="6094372">It's easy for a judge or easier perhaps for a judge sitting back looking at a developed trial record to say well, from the words of this regulation you should have done A.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.397" offset="6150587">But the Court has not imposed liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.505" offset="6163022">Until we've determined that it's clearly established, we don't impose liability on those public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.345" offset="6190398">Another great danger in this area is that if we accept the argument that regulatory or statutory violations are relevant to the general good faith of public officials and hence to their qualified immunity, there's no reason not to expand the analysis beyond at that point at the behest of other plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1533.728" offset="6272004">In other cases there might be commissions of common law torts or violation of professional codes of ethics.</text>

            <text syncTime="1583.302" offset="6470222">A court faced with an immunity claim will once more have to look at that particular violation to determine whether or not in the circumstances of that case that violation demonstrates a lack of good faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="1637.150" offset="6685679">I'm really at complete odds with opposing counsel in this case from the very beginning point of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.804" offset="6720266">The first issue is whether or not the law was clearly established when Gregory Scherer was fired, as to whether or not he had some opportunity, some right to have an opportunity to be heard before he was terminated from public employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.768" offset="6784109">The district court judge found that he did not have that right to some opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.732" offset="6812008">The district court found that Scherer's right to due process was clearly established and that it had been violated by his termination without an opportunity to be heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.978" offset="6868955">What happened in this case was was that Scherer did have a conflict with the people in his troop.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.721" offset="6911900">His supervisor recommended a three-day suspension on October 12, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.675" offset="6935724">Twelve days later Colonel Beach fired him without an opportunity for Scherer to be heard by Colonel Beach in any fashion... in terms of a written letter, in terms of an opportunity to appear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.544" offset="6987237">And from Fuentes v. Shevin, and Perry v. Sindermann, and Roth v. Board of Regents, and Arnett v. Kennedy, the law was clearly established that there should be some opportunity to be heard before the disciplinarian takes the disciplinary act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.677" offset="7059753">And the disciplinarian in this case was Colonel Beach.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.145" offset="7069575">And the law that clearly established it beyond peradventure was Thurston v. Dekle, a 1976 Fifth Circuit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.686" offset="7107818">When Mr. Franks was discussing the law, I think he misspoke, and he called Weisbrod v. Donigan Thurston v. Dekle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.905" offset="7136657">Thurston v. Dekle is the case in the Fifth Circuit that said the accommodation that must be struck must include some minimal opportunity to be heard by the determiner of the ultimate sanction before the sanction is imposed, and then, of course, there would be a post-termination hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1776.457" offset="7242819">What... if the district court vacated its holding concerning the 1977 statute and decided instead something in connection with the 1981 statute, which even you agree was error for it to do, what's left for it to base a damages award on at all?</text>

            <text syncTime="1827.992" offset="7448977">The question, the threshold question is was the constitutional right clearly established, and was Scherer deprived of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.146" offset="7481578">If he was, there is no need to reach Harlow v. Fitzgerald or anything else in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.832" offset="7504357">And what I am saying is given this Court's opinions and given Thurston v. Dekle, the district court's initial ruling, which was that the law was clearly established, was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.298" offset="7546257">Then the district court retreated in light of Weisbrod v. Donigan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.138" offset="7565588">And Weisbrod v. Donigan is a page and a half decision that never even makes a mention of all of the due process cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.009" offset="7601115">And the only thing I can say about Weisbrod v. Donigan is that it is an anomaly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.164" offset="7621699">It certainly was no basis for the district court to have retreated from its initial conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.756" offset="7644060">And oddly, if one follows through on Thurston v. Dekle, and the district court did... there's a case called Glenn v. Neuman at 614 F. Second, a Fifth Circuit case in 1980, which says very clearly that Thurston v. Dekle sets forth the due process law in this circuit, which is some chance to be heard before you're fired.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.018" offset="9205137">The Harlow problem that's raised by the other side is they neglect at all to make the distinction between discretionary and nondiscretionary duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="2283.935" offset="9272742">Harlow says that when a public official is performing a discretionary duty, then if he or she violates clearly established law, then they're liable in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.398" offset="9314643">This... in this case we're dealing with a nondiscretionary, mandatory duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2300.036" offset="9337213">Colonel Beach had a mandatory duty to give Scherer, under the state regulation, an opportunity to be heard; and he didn't do that under the state regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.548" offset="9379217">So we're dealing here with a nondiscretionary duty, and once the concern about discretionary/nondiscretionary functions is removed from the case, then the question becomes whether or not the official was acting in good faith and whether or not damages can be awarded on a summary judgment basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.977" offset="9456958">The Court had two concerns in Harlow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.274" offset="9466153">Once is if a defendant... if a public official has to choose between A and B, the public official should not worry about the potential of a damage action being filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2342.568" offset="9507322">The clearly established constitutional right principle would mean that in choosing between A and B, if he violated that clearly established principle, there would be damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.326" offset="9550372">But if it weren't clearly established, then he shouldn't have to worry about the choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.405" offset="9566672">When you're dealing with a nondiscretionary duty as in this situation, then we come to whether or not the official's conduct was objectively reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2390.734" offset="9700001">And I've set it out in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.797" offset="9708256">When an official is performing a discretionary function, then generally he or she should not be held liable in damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.448" offset="9738871">And... and what we've got in this situation is a nondiscretionary function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.511" offset="9755067">And one of the other concerns about Harlow was summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.571" offset="9771368">Can you decide a case on summary judgment, or will you get tied up in trying these cases on good faith/bad faith?</text>
            <text syncTime="2416.066" offset="9801356">If one looks at this situation, Beach's violation of the regulation is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.988" offset="9824971">It's an objective criteria.</text>
            <text syncTime="2424.048" offset="9833226">So the violation of the regulation and the due process violation, albeit it not clearly established the way the district judge came to his second conclusion, allows there to be a decision on immunity without having to have a full trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.356" offset="9898427">So we have a violation of an established constitutional principle and a violation of a regulation which parallels that principle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.256" offset="9930088">And that then allows a district court to award damages without the need for a trial on whether or not the official was acting in good faith or bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.676" offset="9967704">And that's why Harlow is really no problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2460.628" offset="9979511">And, Justice White, I can defend this case on the Harlow grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2463.753" offset="9992050">The Solicitor General nor the state have made the distinction between discretionary/nondiscretionary duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2470.655" offset="10019635">They lump them all together.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.171" offset="10025696">That's not what Harlow talks about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.747" offset="10032070">And in terms of the focus being on objective criteria, the violation of the regulation here, along with the violation of the Constitution, meets the objective criteria... objective criteria test and does not require the case to be tried.</text>

I like to take them one step at a time... and I think that when you're dealing with a regulation that parallels the constitutional right... and that's exactly what this regulation does; in fact, it looks like it was passed to enact really the meaning of Thurston v. Dekle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.955" offset="10536860">I think in that situation there is no need for a district court to make further inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.106" offset="10557444">Whether or not in some subsequent case that might be, that's what the Solicitor General suggests in this parade of horribles about what may happen in the future; but my concern is this case and the constitutional due process right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.132" offset="10605614">And Harlow certainly did not preclude the use of a regulation or statutory violation when it's clear and mandatory as being a portion of the basis for making the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.629" offset="10659531">The essential basis, of course, is the violation of the Constitution which existed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2635.424" offset="10678757">There is another problem in this case, and that's a jurisdictional one.</text>
            <text syncTime="2640.295" offset="10698192">Under 28 U.S.C. Section 1254(2), this Court's jurisdiction to review a case on appeal is limited to those federal questions presented in the declaring unconstitutional of the state statute by the federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2655.164" offset="10757751">This Harlow federal question presented is... is clearly not... is clearly not one that arises through the decision of the court of appeals that the state statute was unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.392" offset="10818564">Once I've conceded that portion of the case, that the court should not have reached that, what is left?</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.236" offset="10845941">Only possibly an issue that should be decided on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="2681.014" offset="10861092">There was no petition for certiorari sought in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2684.232" offset="10873944">1254(2) limits the federal questions presented not to the question that's been presented, a subsidiary question presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.416" offset="10914695">And so our position is is that the Court should not exercise its jurisdiction to reach the Harlow problem in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.379" offset="10946564">I call it a problem only because the other side has called it a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2707.519" offset="10967149">But on those three grounds, then, we think that the decision below regarding to damages should be affirmed: a) that the law was clearly established and therefore there's no need to get into any question of whether or not there is an immunity problem in the case; b) if the law was not clearly established, Harlow is no problem because Harlow focuses on a discretionary duty, not a nondiscretionary duty, and Harlow focuses on deciding these cases on summary judgment, and this could have been decided on summary judgment because Colonel Beach violated a nondiscretionary duty, and he also violated the Constitution; and finally, that there's no need to exercise the Court's jurisdiction since under 1254(2) it's limited, and we've conceded the point dealing with the declaring unconstitutional of the state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2759.484" offset="11174979">So for those reasons we suggest the decision below should be affirmed.</text>
