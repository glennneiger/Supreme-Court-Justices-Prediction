            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="74.469" offset="445175">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="76.903" offset="454892">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.152" offset="475895">The question presented is whether an accountant privilege should be created to shield from the IRS the tax accrual work papers that were prepared by an independent public accountant in connection with his audit of a publicly held corporation pursuant to the federal securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.724" offset="550187">The Court of Appeals established such a privilege and on that basis denied enforcement of the IRS summons for the tax accrual work papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.345" offset="588744">This marks the first and only occasion that any federal accountant privilege has ever been adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.153" offset="615911">The background of this case may be briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.060" offset="631585">The federal securities laws require that publicly held corporations, such as Amerada Hess, file financial statements that have been audited and certified by an independent certified public accountant.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.536" offset="689472">Under generally accepted accounting principles, the corporation must accrue as a charge to earnings a reserve for contingent tax liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.986" offset="731268">This reflects the possibility that the corporation will owe more in taxes than it paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.482" offset="757286">In accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the independent public auditors must determine the adequacy of this reserve in order to certify that the financial statement fairly presents the financial condition of the corporation and was prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="173.490" stopTime="179.378">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="173.490" offset="841296">Now, federal law doesn't require that; that's a matter of accounting standards, is that right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="179.378" stopTime="186.140">
            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="179.378" offset="864806">Federal law requires that the financial statement be audited in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="186.140" stopTime="192.359">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="186.140" offset="891869">Right.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.377" offset="892809">But that just is determined by the practice of the accountants generally, not by federal law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="192.359" stopTime="197.433">
            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="192.359" offset="916737">That's correct, and then it is incorporated, as it were, into the SEC regulations.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="197.433" stopTime="206.304">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="197.433" offset="937008">Mr. Levy, would your position be any different if this were a small closely held corporation, not listed?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="206.304" stopTime="230.469">
            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="206.304" offset="972535">Well, I think that would be a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.319" offset="984551">Our position would be the same, that the IRS is entitled to those work papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.535" offset="997508">That case would not raise the dimension that this one does about the conflict that the Court of Appeals perceived between the tax laws and the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.627" offset="1037841">In that situation there would only be the unfairness rationale of the Court of Appeals to sustain any claim to privilege.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="230.469" stopTime="234.933">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="230.469" offset="1069188">Well, certainly some of your arguments here would be inapplicable in that situation, I would think.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="234.933" stopTime="257.329">
            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="234.933" offset="1087056">Well, I think it's really more that the accounting firm's arguments would be inapplicable in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.931" offset="1111088">They are the ones who have to come forward and justify the privilege, and one of the grounds that the Court of Appeals relied on in sustaining the privilege here was that to allow the IRS to have access to these papers would in some way undermine the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.408" offset="1165005">That simply would not be a problem in the hypothetical.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="257.329" stopTime="262.077">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="257.329" offset="1176603">Wouldn't some of your arguments be inapplicable, to wit, the duty owed to the public?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="262.077" stopTime="379.871">
            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="262.077" offset="1195621">Well, it would be inapplicable in the sense that we wouldn't need to respond to that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.514" offset="1217355">In that situation, Justice Blackmun, essentially the argument would be that there is some sort of an accountant privilege that shields in-house work by a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.587" offset="1257688">That's an issue that could be litigated, but we think it's very unlikely that any court would recognize a privilege in those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.271" offset="1284437">There are some cases, I should add, that approach the hypothetical that you put.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.112" offset="1307738">The El Paso case that's pending here on certiorari here involved in-house auditors, but their work was done in connection with a public securities review.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.297" offset="1348489">The case the Eleventh Circuit recently decided, In Re Newton, did involve a closely held non-public corporation, but the auditors in that case were outside auditors rather than in-house auditors, so that they approach but are not exactly the same as your hypothetical, Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.274" offset="1420378">In this case, the IRS was conducting a tax investigation of Respondent Amerada Hess.</text>
            <text syncTime="325.255" offset="1448381">Respondent Arthur Young is the independent public auditor that audited and certified Amerada Hess' financial statement for the years in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.813" offset="1486625">The IRS issued a summons to Arthur Young for, among other things, the tax accrual work papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.606" offset="1517763">Arthur Young, acting both at its own instance and at the directions of Amerada Hess, declined to comply with the summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.150" offset="1551931">The Government then brought this enforcement action in district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.680" offset="1566037">The district court held that the tax accrual work papers are relevant and not privileged and it ordered that they be produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.162" offset="1599996">A divided Court of Appeals reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.036" offset="1611490">Although it agreed with the district court that the tax accrual work papers are relevant, it held that they are protected by an accountant privilege and that the Government had not made an adequate showing to overcome that privilege.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="379.871" offset="1666765">Mr. Levy, a special agent had shown up before the summons was issued, hadn't he?</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="385.151" offset="1687977">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.853" offset="1690693">It was a joint civil-criminal investigation at that point.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="388.040" stopTime="390.992">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="388.040" offset="1699470">Would your case be stronger if he hadn't appeared?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="390.992" stopTime="456.263">
            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="390.992" offset="1711278">I don't believe our case would be materially different.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.334" offset="1724652">We think the IRS has summons authority to get these work papers in a civil case, in a criminal case, or in a joint investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.455" offset="1761119">Now, our case would be stronger, and the Court of Appeals recognized that if the IRS were investigating fraud or some other state of mind issue, there would be no privilege for the work papers, and in a criminal investigation that is much more likely, of course, to arise.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.808" offset="1830605">But it could also come up in a civil investigation as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.040" offset="1843457">We think the Court of Appeals made a fundamental mistake in saying that because the IRS had not alleged fraud at the time it issued the summons, then the privilege applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.333" offset="1888701">That put the cart before the horse, since the whole purpose of the investigation was to determine whether there was any basis for liability, including penalties for fraud or any other violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.457" offset="1929139">So that would be the difference if there were a criminal case here, and the Court of Appeals simply ignored the fact that this was a joint civil-criminal investigation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="456.263" stopTime="461.121">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="456.263" offset="1972398">Well, certainly the appearance of a special agent has criminal case overtones.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="mark_i_levy" startTime="461.121" stopTime="666.052">
            <label>Mr. Mark I. Levy</label>
            <text syncTime="461.121" offset="1991833">Yes, a special agent does investigate for criminal purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.463" offset="2005208">But the Court of Appeals put great weight on the fact that in that investigation the IRS had not made any allegations of fraud in issuing the summons.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.036" offset="2035510">We think that was a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.834" offset="2042615">The IRS should have the authority to get these work papers for, among other reasons, to determine whether there's any basis for an allegation of fraud, and the Government can't make that allegation before it conducts its investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.343" offset="2092666">The Court of Appeals' creation of an accountant privilege in this case rested on two theories: first, that IRS access to tax accrual work papers would be unfair and prejudicial to the taxpayer; and second, that IRS access would chill candor in communications between the corporation and the independent public auditor, and that this would work to the disadvantage of the investing public and be contrary to the policies of the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.129" offset="2219830">And me consider each of these theories in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.969" offset="2235190">But even taken together, we think the Court of Appeals took too expansive a view of its role to weigh competing policy considerations against the Government's entitlement to obtain information pursuant to statute, and that neither of its theories justifies the creation of a novel accountant privilege or overcomes the strong presumption in the law against the establishment of a new privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.694" offset="2338112">First, the claim of unfairness.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.036" offset="2351487">This claim seems to derive from one of three sources, that IRS access here is unfair: one, because of something about the process or the balance of advantage between the taxpayer and the IRS in a tax investigation; or two, because something in the relationship between the corporation and its independent public auditor makes it unfair; or three, that there's something in the contents of the work papers that makes it unfair for the IRS to summon these.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.319" offset="2492652">I'll address each of these in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.222" offset="2508221">The claim that the process of tax investigation makes it unfair for the IRS to have access must be assessed in the context of our self-reporting tax system.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.964" offset="2571229">IRS enforcement of the tax laws serves two basic purposes: First, it furthers the fundamental government interest in collecting revenues; and second, it achieves equity among taxpayers by ensuring that a taxpayer who fully complies voluntarily is not put at a disadvantage in relation to a less scrupulous taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.565" offset="2673629">Now, under our tax system the taxpayer has an affirmative obligation to pay his fair share of taxes and to compile and to provide to the Government a great deal of information to demonstrate his compliance with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.638" offset="2737890">That's the nature of the tax system.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.871" offset="2750847">While it is of course often true that the IRS and the taxpayer may have opposing views, the nature of the tax system is not arm's length or adversarial in the same sense that a system of litigation is.</text>

            <text syncTime="695.520" offset="2929420">Whatever may be true in the litigation area, there is no room in a tax investigation system for a sporting theory of justice that requires that the relative advantages between the taxpayer and the IRS be equalized.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.122" offset="3027849">A tax investigation is not a competitive event like a horse race or a golf match, in which each of the participants has to bear an equalizing handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.771" offset="3070377">The fundamental point here, to get to it, is that... is whether the tax accrual work papers will be available to help to ensure that all facts and all issues are brought out into the open so that the IRS can form a judgment about the taxpayer's tax liabilities and any issues can be resolved through the processes provided by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.857" offset="3162746">There's no room for the taxpayer to complain, as Respondents do here, that the IRS' enforcement is too effective or that the relevant information will be too helpful to the IRS in determining the taxpayer's liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="844.258" offset="3524385">Now, the claim of unfairness may also rest in part not on this balance of advantage, but on the idea that IRS access will intrude into a sensitive relation between the accountant and the corporation that the law should protect.</text>

            <text syncTime="1631.177" offset="6672035">But as I understand it, both the requirements of the profession and the implementation of those requirements are somewhat vague.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.049" offset="6707562">There's room for discretion and the practices among the accountant firms vary quite widely about the degree of detail that's disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.577" offset="6749671">I did, for example, look at the Amerada Hess 10k's in this case and did not see any separate item even for tax accrual liabilities, let alone broken down by the kind of item.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.539" offset="6809439">Let me just touch briefly on the second half of the Court of Appeals' reasoning, that there is some perceived conflict between the securities laws and the tax laws and that IRS access here would chill the candor of communications between the corporation and the auditor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.998" offset="6887284">This is clearly in the nature of an accountant-client communication privilege and we think therefore inconsistent with Couch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.717" offset="6914243">We also think it's inconsistent with this Court's decision in St. Regis Paper, that holds that a statute is not to be read to create a privilege unless it clearly so provides.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.103" offset="6951755">There's nothing in the securities laws here that establishes a privilege or cuts back on the IRS summons the Service would otherwise have.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.301" offset="6988535">The Court of Appeals' reasoning on this point was quite speculative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.580" offset="7005671">They may be right that in some circumstances there will be some effect on some corporations in their communications with their auditors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.047" offset="7035555">But beyond that no generalization is possible, and there was no adequate basis for the Court of Appeals' broader generality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.294" offset="7068470">Indeed, there's substantial room for doubting whether the absence of a privilege would have any effect on compliance with the securities laws, because both the corporation and the auditor are under independent legal duties to perform their functions in accordance with the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.707" offset="7134194">In particular, the auditor will not give an unqualified opinion if he is not satisfied that the financial statement fairly presents the financial condition and has not had access to adequate information on which to form a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.765" offset="7198350">That provides him with a strong means to obtain the cooperation of the corporation in getting access to the necessary materials.</text>

            <text syncTime="1818.165" offset="7419973">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.351" offset="7432721">What the Government seeks here is this Court's sanctioning an invasion into the thought processes of the independent auditors by obtaining the tax accrual work papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.641" offset="7485906">To understand the issue that is presented to this Court, it is essential to understand what is in the tax accrual work papers and, more importantly, what is not in the tax accrual work papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.200" offset="7528120">The tax accrual papers are prepared by the auditors and are primarily the auditors' opinions, judgments, assessments and thought processes in determining whether the provision for taxes shown on the financial statements of a corporate taxpayer are reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.581" offset="7613697">It is not to determine whether the amount provided for on the financial statements are exact or the exact amount of taxes that will eventually be paid by the corporate taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.421" offset="7661031">They do contain some facts, but these are purely incidental to the judgmental processes of the auditors in evaluating the contingency reserve for taxes on the financial statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.569" offset="7721635">And, contrary to the Government's position which is sprinkled throughout its papers and in the argument today, the facts comprise a very minimal or minor element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.030" offset="7767402">As in the attorney work product doctrine, an analogue to which the Second Circuit looked in drafting a carefully crafted exception for tax accrual work papers, the fact that there are some facts incidental to the independent... the lawyer's thought processes, does not make the materials otherwise discoverable unless there is a particularized need shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.834" offset="7866667">Now, the components of the tax accrual are essentially two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.128" offset="7883803">One is an evaluation of possible disallowances by the IRS and possible overpayments by the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.359" offset="7920793">It is not infrequent that in a review of the tax accounts we will find that a client has provided too much of a tax reserve and will not pay the taxes that it proposes to pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.558" offset="7973560">The second component is the evaluation of pending disputes with the IRS, either in the form of existing revenue agent reviews or sometimes in actual litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.990" offset="8023297">Now, to make these evaluations the auditor must review the corporate records.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.192" offset="8044091">I note, it is the same universe of corporate records that are available to the IRS when it conducts its audit, and in this case the IRS agents made over 400 document requests to Amerada, 398 of which were complied with, and Amerada produced close to 45,000 pieces of paper to the IRS and expended some 11,500 person-hours of work prior to the time that the IRS sought enforcement of the summons against Arthur Young &amp; Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.146" offset="8167911">The auditor must make a series of judgments on worst case scenarios, what could happen, what might happen, what's the likelihood of something happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.832" offset="8206677">But it is a judgmental process reviewing those facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.736" offset="8222246">It needs to discuss matters with the client's personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.765" offset="8234367">For example, if there's been a revenue agent review and a disallowance, it needs to know the client's position with respect to that disallowance to determine whether or not the client has provided for a potential tax liability or whether the client intends to fight it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.120" offset="8291836">It is not infrequent that we will find statements in the tax accrual work papers such as, the client will pay and let someone else litigate and preserve a claim for refund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.412" offset="8336976">Similarly, there may already be a litigation and we will have counsel's opinion in the tax accrual work papers on the potential outcome of that litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.049" offset="8371562">It is not unusual to find statements in there from counsel to the effect that, although there is a split in the circuits and we believe the client should prevail, we nevertheless recommend that the client settle this matter in the following amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.665" offset="8429972">The tax accrual papers, therefore, are an amalgam of opinions and only incidentally, as I noted, do they contain facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.603" offset="8465707">The Government's speculation on this is unsupported by the record below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2086.271" offset="8492457">In addition, contrary to the Government's reply brief, the fact that an item is included in the contingency reserve does not mean that there is a substantial question about the correctness of the return.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.578" offset="8541671">Rather, it means that we are trying to evaluate the totality of the reserve in relationship to all the other accounts on the financial statements for the reasonableness of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.434" offset="8585035">As I noted at the start, it is not the taxes that we think the client will necessarily pay, but whether the amount provided for in the financial statements bears a reasonable relationship.</text>

            <text syncTime="2929.022" offset="11863402">What authority in our past cases is there for that sort of a thing, to just evaluate something in terms of "fairness"?</text>

          <turn speaker="william_e_jackson" startTime="2937.065" stopTime="3153.695">
            <label>Mr. William Eldred Jackson</label>
            <text syncTime="2937.065" offset="11895585">I think, Your Honor, this Court has held in a series of cases, the Powell case being one, that an IRS summons will be enforced only under certain conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.228" offset="11980221">And one condition is that the Service is not already in possession of the information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2965.369" offset="12008852">That was part of the ruling in Powell.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.148" offset="12023898">Here there is no question that the Service is in possession of practically every piece of paper in Amerada's books and records relating to the factual transactional aspects of its tax liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.795" offset="12098504">That is, therefore there is no need for the Service to seek the tax accrual papers when it has had access to all the great volume of materials which Mr. Liggio mentioned earlier from the taxpayer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.958" offset="12183141">And in Euge, which is a later case, the Court reinforced that aspect of enforcement of an IRS summons by saying that enforcement must in the case be necessary to the enforcement of the tax laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3036.027" offset="12291392">Now, we say that access by the Service to the judgmental and private thought papers contained in these tax accrual work papers is not necessary, first because there is no claim of fraud in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.110" offset="12379790">And by the way, Your Honors, when the summons to Arthur Young was issued which is here involved this investigation had been under way for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.530" offset="12421482">The Service had had the records of Amerada Hess and it should have known by that time whether there was any basis to claim fraud or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.257" offset="12456381">But fraud is not in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.118" offset="12471846">Therefore, it is not essential for the Service to seek for evidence of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.646" offset="12497864">And indeed, the reply brief, I believe at page 19, disclaims any interest in the judgmental portions of these papers, which I think is certainly a concession that they are not needed for those purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.338" offset="12592636">And so, if there is no need then I say it is unfair to enforce the summons against the taxpayer, against his independent auditor, to compel the revelation of his private thoughts as to his strategies in audit and in litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.376" offset="12688871">And that's... this Court in a recent case involving an IRS summons, the Badgett case, adverted to considerations of fundamental fairness in the context of the enforcement of an IRS summons.</text>

            <text syncTime="3172.784" offset="12838501">Under the alternate ground, the additional ground, which is the intrusion upon the independent auditor's function, they would not be under that rationale because they're not independent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.576" offset="12893671">But certainly from the point of view of compelling the taxpayer to reveal all in this adversarial process to the IRS while the taxpayer can't get the same information from the IRS, it would be most unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.675" offset="12962008">And that was the situation, Your Honor, that was involved, of course, in El Paso, where the papers had been prepared internally.</text>

            <text syncTime="3336.102" offset="13491771">But isn't the entire tax system established on the theory that every person who evades or avoids a tax, particularly evades a tax, puts a burden on every other taxpayer, and doesn't that fundamental fairness have to take into account all of the taxpayers' interests?</text>

            <label>Mr. William Eldred Jackson</label>
            <text syncTime="3366.000" offset="13611307">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice, I could not differ from that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.324" offset="13628652">But I don't think that answers the question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.040" offset="13643490">Here what is involved is not the normal aspects of a tax audit in which the auditor seeks... the IRS seeks to determine whether there's liability and if so the amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3402.561" offset="13757593">This is a far more intrusive process, and I would not want the members of the Court to feel that in some way this privilege which we are arguing for is meant to serve as a cover for nefariousness or for deliberate tax evasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.986" offset="13871278">That is not at all... this was not at all in the mind of the Second Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.438" offset="13897087">But, Mr. Chief Justice and Justices, as you all know probably from personal experience how difficult the Internal Revenue Code is to read, let alone understand, with its qualifications and its exceptions and its cross-references and what-not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.711" offset="13970125">And there exist many times good faith grounds for differences of opinion as to whether a given transaction is, say, subject to normal regular income or capital gains treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.938" offset="14035118">And these are the areas in which we think that the private thoughts of the taxpayer, often informed and assisted by his counsel as well as his independent auditor, should not be subject to the intrusion of the IRS, and that it would be unfair to do so, because as the Second Circuit found, and I think common experience bears this out, the relationship between the taxpayer and the Service is at heart adversarial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3510.188" offset="14188091">Certainly that is true in the case of a large corporation which is audited automatically, constantly, and the Service... they are constantly having differences over the treatment of certain items, and the Service's intent is obviously to maximize tax liability, the intent of the taxpayer is to take advantage of all lawful provisions in the tax laws to reduce liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.874" offset="14354857">Now, I would like to say one word on the subject of Congress' intent, which was raised earlier during the argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.415" offset="14433015">I think Congress' intent in this area must be found not only in the tax laws and not only in the securities laws, but also in Rule 501 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which was enacted pursuant to Congressional authority and approved by Congress, and that is the rule which authorizes... indeed, the legislative history shows invites... the federal courts to develop the law of privilege under the principles of the common law, on the basis of experience in cases where development of new privileges are warranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.014" offset="14671356">This is a provision which the Government admits gives the courts the power to develop new privileges, as the Second Circuit did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.355" offset="14732796">Their argument is that Congress should be the forum to decide this issue before the Court, rather than... that is, the issue of privilege... rather than the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.943" offset="14783056">Well, I submit that is no answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.143" offset="14799879">However this Court decides the case, it will be decided one way or the other and it will decide in favor of one policy or the other, in favor of fairness or that fairness is not offended.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.586" offset="14885665">This Court will be making the decision, and indeed this is what Congress envisioned in Rule 501.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.658" offset="14925998">And indeed, even before that rule was adopted this Court in the Hickman case, which the court below relied on as an analogue, the Court did not leave the question to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.635" offset="14997887">This Court decided it and held proper the creation by the lower court of the attorney's work product privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.318" offset="15036548">In short, Your Honors, we think that the position which is taken by the Government here is contrary to the position of the Service itself in its revised guidelines which permit access to the tax accrual work papers only as a last resort, only after all other avenues of factual inquiry have been exhausted, and only on a showing of particularized need for specific issues, not some generalized desire to see whatever may turn up in the tax accrual papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.549" offset="15225570">We think, in short, that the position of the Government on this case is belied by the position of the Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.374" offset="15268829">We think the Government seeks to overreach and that this Court should not countenance that result.</text>
