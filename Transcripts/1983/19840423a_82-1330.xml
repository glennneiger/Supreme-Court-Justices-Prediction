            <text syncTime="45.277" offset="336295">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the ultimate question which we are here about today is to resolve whether the respondent was denied his rights under the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment when he was indicted, tried, and convicted of manslaughter by culpable negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.502" offset="429186">Our discussion this morning will focus on three principal areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.031" offset="455309">The first is the appropriate federal or constitutional standard to be applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.545" offset="477356">Two, that with the exception of the denial of post-conviction relief herein, which was without opinion, the Mississippi Supreme Court has never addressed the question of whether reckless driving is a lesser included offense of manslaughter by culpable negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.756" offset="550185">And three, that both the District Court and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has misconstrued the law of the state of Mississippi when they held that reckless driving was a lesser included offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="136.850" offset="702532">Let me qualify that with this.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.442" offset="716951">It was initially done that way or was later done that way in this case, that the justice courts of the state of Mississippi in which they were at the time of this case, five per county, one for each supervisor's beat, that the misdemeanor charges, they have primary jurisdiction of misdemeanor charges.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="164.540" offset="813291">Well, was there any Mississippi statute that required the trial of those charges, the misdemeanor charges, in the justice of the peace court independently of any other court?</text>

            <label>Mr. William S. Boyd, III</label>
            <text syncTime="176.629" offset="861670">None that would require it.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.473" offset="869088">However, as I pointed out in the reply to the brief of amicus in this matter, that in Stenson v. State, which has been recently decided by our Supreme Court, they have held that it was a... that the conviction was reversible where the individual was indicted in a multi-count indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.605" offset="945575">In other words, we cannot charge more than one charge per indictment, nor can we try under Stenson more than one charge per case unless it is with the agreement of the parties, which was done so in this case on appeal from the misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.068" offset="1003462">So, unlike the federal government, or unlike the federal procedure under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, we do not have a requirement that all of the charges be contained in one indictment, but instead it is just the opposite, the old common law rule that they have to be brought by separate indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.216" offset="1392060">We have in essence or had at the time that this case came down four different types of prosecutors in the state of Mississippi.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.055" offset="1423407">We had municipal prosecutors who were limited in jurisdiction to the municipalities in which their court sat plus they were only appointed in cities where we had a population in excess of 10,000.</text>

            <text syncTime="343.310" offset="1528419">They have prosecuted cases involving misdemeanors in the justice courts and in county courts in those counties which have county courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.794" offset="1558303">They have assisted the district attorney, who is normally elected from a multi-county district or a circuit district in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.103" offset="1591531">Under the constitution of the state, the district attorney has primary jurisdiction of all felony cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="367.693" offset="1625908">Now, in 1979, after this case was tried, the Mississippi legislature clarified the jurisdiction between all of these various and sundry prosecuting authorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1036.479" offset="4301056">I will parenthetically add that the order entered by the Mississippi Supreme Court in this case has recently been interpreted to include procedural bars, that is, under Wainwright versus Sikes as decided by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.722" offset="4374094">However, at the time frame in which this case came up, I must candidly admit that under Ulster County Court versus Allen, the state did not proceed under the theory of procedural bar, so consequently we do not argue it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1069.825" offset="4434489">The Fifth Circuit and the District Court both relied on deciding the double jeopardy question upon the test articulated by this Court in Blockburger versus the United States, the same evidence test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.335" offset="4500527">Our position as expounded upon by Justice White in his opinion in Vitalli v. Illinois is that the state is not precluded from prosecuting respondent notwithstanding the fact that there was a substantial overlap in proof required to prove both the crimes of reckless driving and manslaughter by culpable negligence because each offense requires proof of a statutory element the other does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.807" offset="4618391">In Albernaz versus United States, Whalen versus the United States, this Court indicated that the test articulated in Blockburger was a rule of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.645" offset="4685787">Applying that rule of statutory construction to the case at bar, we find that the application of the test should focus, one, upon the statutory elements of the offense of reckless driving, and two, upon the statutory offense or the general catch-all statute of manslaughter by culpable negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.791" offset="4790277">Now, this distinguishes this case from the statutory situation in which we found in Vitalli.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.804" offset="4814414">In Vitalli, the state of Illinois had a specific statute dealing with the reckless use of an automobile, of a motor vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.988" offset="4851090">We do not have that in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.550" offset="4861330">Instead, we have a general or omnibus statute dealing with manslaughter or a catch-all statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.780" offset="4890274">They specifically define various and sundry forms of manslaughter in other statutes, and then say all other homicides, including homicide by culpable negligence, shall be construed as manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.634" offset="4945653">Therefore, we find that there are two separate and distinct statutory provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1397.534" offset="5745314">I believe Justice O'Connor asked a question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1400.159" offset="5755763">To clarify a procedural point, the state of Mississippi could have indicted Mr. Roberts at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1410.200" offset="5795991">The thing about it is... and could have called a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.747" offset="5814172">The thing about it is, this particular judicial district was at that time the busiest judicial district in the state of Mississippi, processing over 4,000 criminal cases a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.994" offset="5855132">As a matter of actual practice, they did not call grand juries except during the terms in which the court was in session.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.065" offset="5899436">In particular, the court was in session, I believe, 48 weeks out of 52 in every given year at that particular time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.018" offset="5927230">They had one judge, one district attorney, and one assistant district attorney to handle that many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.609" offset="5953562">So, as a consequence, it simply was not done, although it could have been done in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.308" offset="5980416">I want to direct my attention here in the last few minutes to two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.696" offset="6009986">The first is that the Fifth Circuit misconstrued the state... or the case of Smith v. State in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.475" offset="6045095">The Mississippi Supreme Court has never addressed the question of whether reckless driving was a lesser included or is a lesser included offense to the offense of manslaughter by culpable negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.375" offset="6096713">The case cited by the Fifth Circuit applying this judicial veneer as they call it was not in fact a judicial veneer but was in fact addressing the particular facts of that case to the law as it applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.809" offset="6150421">In particular, Smith v. State dealt with whether gross negligence was sufficient, or proof of gross negligence was sufficient to prove culpable negligence under this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.972" offset="6203083">They held that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.191" offset="6211965">We also note that the Court has held that DWI is not a lesser included offense to the crime of manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.281" offset="6248327">That was in Outshall v. State.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.341" offset="6256478">Finally, we look to the legislative intent, following the Albernaz line of reasoning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.153" offset="6283750">We note that we have separate statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.527" offset="6297229">The manslaughter statute was enacted in 1848.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.541" offset="6309350">The reckless driving statute was enacted in 1938.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.993" offset="6327113">Manslaughter is contained in Title 97 of the Mississippi Code dealing with criminal offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.424" offset="6360863">Reckless driving is in Title 63, dealing with traffic offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.954" offset="6383015">Manslaughter carries its own separate penalty of up to 20 years maximum in the state penitentiary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.295" offset="6416347">Reckless driving has its own separate offense or punishment of ten days in the county jail or a fine of $500 or both.</text>
            <text syncTime="1574.541" offset="6453336">Both provisions are unambiguous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.335" offset="6468487">There is no legislative history behind either one of these things, so consequently following the presumption that this Court discussed in Albernaz, we should presume that the legislature of the state of Mississippi, which as pointed out by this Court about the Congress is primarily a lawyers' body.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.107" offset="6551557">It therefore must be presumed that the legislature was familiar with this Court's doctrine in Blockburger versus the United States and that they construed reckless driving to be a separate offense for which separate punishment could be imposed other than in the manslaughter situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1756.343" offset="7180585">We filed a brief upon which the argument to be presented today relies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.622" offset="7205663">The single question presented to this Court is, does or did the Fifth Circuit correctly apply the holding in Vitalli.</text>
            <text syncTime="1771.774" offset="7242234">As will be further discussed, and as is discussed fully in our brief, we think it is clear that the Fifth Circuit did correctly apply the language in Vitalli for a two-trial situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1787.423" offset="7304824">Have there been two trials?</text>

            <text syncTime="1792.172" offset="7323841">We think the test to be applied where two trials have been held is as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.622" offset="7341604">There is double jeopardy where the same factual elements used for the second prosecution were proved in the other or first prosecution, which simply is what I believe this Court held in Brown versus Ohio.</text>
