            <text syncTime="73.607" offset="439445">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="76.891" offset="452610">This case is here on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of the Fifth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.763" offset="476121">The battle lines were drawn in this case on the issue of whether or not the Education of All Handicapped Children Act requires public schools to provide and perform medical treatment prescribed by a private physician and delegated to the school as a related service in order for the child to benefit from education, special education, and to receive a free, appropriate public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.170" offset="601717">Initially, the plaintiffs, the respondents here, filed an application for preliminary injunction seeking an order from the district court ordering the district, the Irving Independent School District, to provide a medical procedure subsequently stipulated and found to be medical treatment to the respondent, Amber Tatro.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.863" offset="708506">The school district denied the application... I'm sorry... the district court denied the preliminary application for injunction relief and held that the medical treatment requested did not arise from the effort to educate, and that Section 504 of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act could not be converted into a statute requiring the setting up of governmental health care.</text>

            <text syncTime="173.037" offset="837237">Mr. Deatherage, I guess there's some question, is there not, whether this is indeed medical treatment?</text>

            <text syncTime="181.987" offset="872973">Justice O'Connor, the record reflects there is no question at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.247" offset="894080">Ultimately, the plaintiffs stipulated... or the respondents stipulated in the pretrial order found in the joint appendix that clean intermittent catherization, the procedure in question, was medical treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.645" offset="959595">Their physician... Dr. George Hurt, who was one of the co-authors of the document ultimately adopted by the American Medical Association... testified it was the medical treatment of choice of a disease state suffered by Amber; that is, an urgent bladder.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.807" offset="1036290">So there's never been a question or a dispute, at least since the administrative hearing, as to whether or not the procedure is medical treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="233.071" offset="1077355">If... if a child had to have some medication administered routinely during the school day in order to remain in school would it be your position that it constitutes medical treatment for someone at the school to administer the medication?</text>

            <text syncTime="256.062" offset="1169306">Under Texas law, Justice O'Connor, I don't believe that is construed as medical treatment by the school employee who gives the medication.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.821" offset="1220297">It is medical treatment when the doctor prescribes it so that the parent or the child can go to the pharmacy and obtain the medication.</text>

            <text syncTime="285.877" offset="1288529">Whether or not it has to be administered personally by the physician does not take it out of the realm of medical treatment as defined under the Texas Medical Practice Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.278" offset="1350178">Under that act as amended since trial of this case, the physician... and at the time of trial... the physician may, in accordance with the act and the Board of Medical Examiners rule, prescribe certain medical tasks and delegate them to another party, a third party other than the patient, for performance, such as a scrub nurse in surgery, so long as that physician retains supervision and control of the delegatee and the act to be performed; but it is still medical treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.725" offset="1559993">There is a specific statute... even if we construe it as being medical treatment, if the school teacher gives what the parent had brought, the pill, in a container... there is a Texas statute attached as an appendix to our reply brief that specifically authorizes the public school employee under certain conditions, if the parent sends the medication in its original container, that allows the schoolteacher to give that child that pill and be immune from civil liability for damages if something adverse happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="395.629" offset="1727595">There is no similar statute in Texas that is applicable to this type of procedure involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.313" offset="1762286">The district court initially, as I related earlier, held that the requested medical treatment did not arise from the effort to educate and that it could not be converted into a statute requiring the setting up of governmental health care under Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.285" offset="1874194">The Fifth Circuit panel initially in Tatro I held that the district court was wrong on both counts and vacated and remanded for further proceedings consistent with what we believe... we believe to be an advisory opinion, since the court acknowledged initially it had no facts before it.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.571" offset="1971370">On remand, the district court, feeling constrained by Tatro I, found that the petitioner, the school district, could not lawfully provide the medical treatment under Texas law without additional services of a licensed physician; that under--</text>

            <text syncTime="526.840" offset="2252447">Suppose this were a prescription drug, and it was just a question of the... someone in the school digging it out every four hours and handing it to Amber.</text>

            <text syncTime="549.192" offset="2341786">There is a distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.799" offset="2348264">When the doctor writes a prescription for medication, he writes the prescription directed to the pharmacist to fill this prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.685" offset="2411794">He does not direct that prescription to the public school employee and does not delegate to the public school employee the administering of that pill.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.538" offset="2471249">That's dedicated to the... the prescription is written to the pharmacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.334" offset="2490370">The parent may choose to bring the medicine in its original container, under the state statute, and in writing authorize the school employee to give out of that original container that medication in accordance with the label on... on the container.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.463" offset="2582948">But in that instance, you see, the employee of the school is making no judgments, forming no judgments, is not exercising any medical judgment in merely removing the capsule and giving it to the student with the consent of the parent, because the prescription is not directed to the school employee.</text>

            <text syncTime="638.436" offset="2698828">Your reply brief has the statute about the immunity from liability if they follow that procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="686.385" offset="2890566">Under the Texas Medical Practice Act, the district court found a physician may prescribe medical treatment and delegate its performance to a nonlicensed person or institution that he deems qualified subject to control, supervision and adequate monitoring by the physician; that the physician may prescribe the medical treatment to be furnished by the public school if he believes the school has personnel qualified to perform it.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.324" offset="3038315">The school employee was found... or the school was found to employ professional nurses that with sufficient training, the court found, the school's nurses are capable of performing the medical treatment, and that when the medical treatment is performed by such nurses in accordance with a valid doctor's prescription, it would not constitute the unlawful practice of medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.516" offset="3147089">Until that occurs, the court had found, relying on an amicus brief of the Texas Medical Association attached to its memorandum opinion... opinions, that if the school had provided catheterization without a doctor's prescription valid under Texas law, it would have unlawfully been practicing medicine.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.659" offset="3247713">Also, the court found that if these conditions are met, the medical treatment then becomes services provided by a qualified school nurse or other qualified person, which is the definition of school health services under the regulations implementing the Education of All Handicapped Children Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="800.761" offset="3348127">Therefore, these are school health services and are therefore related services because also under the regulation they define related services to include school health services, and that's not mentioned in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="818.317" offset="3418344">The district court, based on these findings, ordered the petitioner to: one, secure the services of sufficiently trained persons to allow a trained doctor to prescribe medical treatment to be furnished by the school, and to modify Amber Tatro's individualized education plan to provide for the medical treatment as prescribed by her personal physician.</text>

            <text syncTime="1015.516" offset="4207138">The statutory provision in question here is found in Section 1401(17) of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="1046.957" offset="4332839">But there is a limitation placed by Congress in its definition as it relates to medical services, and it limits medical services to diagnosis and evaluation only.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.046" offset="4389264">The implementing regulations define medical services to mean services of a licensed physician for diagnosis, evaluation of a handicapping condition only.</text>

            <text syncTime="1344.790" offset="5524232">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.429" offset="5546801">The true issue of this case before the Court is one of access to public education; more specifically, whether an eight-year old girl of normal intelligence who is capable of doing schoolwork in regular public elementary school will be able to attend class in a regular public elementary school alongside her nonhandicapped age group peers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.120" offset="5653486">If she is to receive a free public education in the public schools, it's been found as a fact that she must be provided the safe, simple, quick, effective and inexpensive service of clean intermittent catherization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.286" offset="5722240">As was brought out this morning in questioning by Justices O'Connor and Blackmun, the service of clean intermittent catheterization is closely analogous to the dispensing of medication by school personnel during the school day to permit a handicapped child to attend school.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.353" offset="5802488">And that service, even the petitioners concede, is not medical treatment within the meaning of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.993" offset="5829028">For example, an orthopedically handicapped child who suffers arthritic pain may have his physician prescribe for him aspirin at regular intervals during the school day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.502" offset="5883050">Without the provision of that medication, the pain that is a symptom of his handicap may prevent him from participating in a public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1444.640" offset="5923592">With the provision of the medication, the child has access to a free public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.059" offset="5949296">A similar analogy would be the child disabled by the handicap of epilepsy whose physician prescribes anti-seizure medication during the school day.</text>

            <text syncTime="1489.028" offset="6101120">Well, the... to the extent that medical equipment... equipment is involved, the school district would not be required to provide the equipment, just as it is not required to provide the catheter in this case, and just as it is not required to provide, for example, a hearing aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.444" offset="6170815">However, the school district would have to make some accommodations so that a... a child who is in traction, and if there are not other reasons to remove him, would be able to attend and participate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.125" offset="6221597">I think that the... what makes the catheterization so analogous to the type of service we talked about this morning is that although it is prescribed by a physician, it is actually delivered quite easily by nonmedical school personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.087" offset="6289410">And although it can be said to treat a health-related symptom of the handicap, it is a service that's needed to enable the child to have access to the public education.</text>

            <text syncTime="2025.786" offset="8248176">One of the things that's led to so much misunderstanding is the assumption that the word "medical" has a fixed meaning from one context to another, and I'd like to give you an example.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.250" offset="8294047">In the Education of the Handicapped Act, medical service is defined not to include physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech pathology, audiology, psychologic services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.900" offset="8344620">Now, in another act of Congress, the Medicaid statute, 42 U.S. Code 1396 and the sections following, those very same services, by name, are defined as medical services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2063.334" offset="8398328">So it's obvious that Congress is not using the word "medical" with as much scope in each situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.171" offset="8429779">And it was the task of the Department of Education to determine in the first instance where to draw the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.077" offset="8457365">And I think what the Department did was to balance two policies that are clear in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2085.027" offset="8485159">One is the policy of nonexclusion, or as this Court pointed out in the Board of Education v. Rowley case, the inclusion into public school of previously excluded handicapped children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.615" offset="8551510">On the other hand, balanced against that was that strictly medical services are not included in the array of related services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.003" offset="8585051">And the way they drew the line was to define medical services as the services of a licensed physician.</text>

            <text syncTime="2154.106" offset="8761430">But that would not exclude it as a service that is also needed during school hours to enable the child to be educated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.542" offset="8799255">We're not asking here that a school district cure the child of the handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="2169.021" offset="8821094">And so the amount of catheterization that Amber happens to receive during the school day would not by itself be enough to accomplish the complete medical purpose, because she still needs it elsewhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="2457.885" offset="9976542">They gave an illustrative list.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.727" offset="9979990">And if the... if I can, I think there are three ways that I can discuss in which this service is needed to assist Amber to benefit from special education.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.394" offset="10038609">Congress clearly envisioned a number of types of educational benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.721" offset="10059925">One, of course, is the benefit of an academic instruction in the classroom; and we've discussed how this is needed in order to get Amber to the classroom and allow her to remain there, just as physical therapy might work with a child's mobility so that a child can move from room to room or so that a child can get into a desk and get out of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.712" offset="10143935">But there's another important educational benefit to which Congress attached at least as much importance, and that's the benefit derived from just being in that classroom with nonhandicapped children, with sharing the normal educational experience in public schools that shapes most people and prepares them for independent life in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.953" offset="10236826">That's a key benefit, and so much stress is laid on it in both the legislative history and the key words of the Act that it's clear that... in fact, it even goes so far as to say that a child is not to be denied that benefit unless it just can't be provided, even with the use of supplementary aids and services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.319" offset="10318328">So that the only children who should be removed from this normal educational experience are those whose special instructional needs are so complex and so special that they can only be provided in an environment that's separate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.345" offset="10386455">But here there's no question but that the type of instruction that Amber can benefit from, not to mention the extracurricular activities that the National School Board Association amicus referred to, all the attributes of normal public school experience, that for Amber the type of instruction needed is precisely the kind that can be provided in a regular public school setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.333" offset="10486348">And for that reason, the Act mandates that she be given a service, especially a service as simple as this, which in a certain amount of time she'll even be able to do for herself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2622.987" offset="10637022">And while we're on the subject of wheelchair, let me recall a very important example that's given in the legislative history by both the principal co-author of Section 504, Senator Humphrey, and one of the major co-authors of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, Senator Stafford.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.261" offset="10718106">They gave the example of a building that's architecturally inaccessible, and said... each of them said it's still discrimination not to do something, even if... whether it's a ramp or whether it's adult assistance to go and get the child and bring the child up; that for a school district... a school district is still violating both acts by failing to extend that additional service needed to overcome this obstacle.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.110" offset="10833463">Now, in Amber's case, the obstacle is different, but it's an obstacle posed by the handicap; that is, to get through a school day she needs adult assistance with her toileting function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.699" offset="10887797">If she receives that adult assistance, which involves a very small amount of time and trouble, then she can share with other children the public school experience that Congress wanted to make available to the maximum extent practicable to handicapped children.</text>
            <text syncTime="2702.782" offset="10956134">If she doesn't receive the service, then she can't be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2706.378" offset="10970553">And the cost... it was brought out in questioning this morning, I believe by Justice O'Connor, as to the disparity in cost between excluding her and segregating her from the regular public school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2717.874" offset="11016529">I'd like to say that the cost is not only in terms of the extra amount of dollars which the taxpayers have to pay to support her in this expensive private school; there's a cost in frustrating the intent of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.757" offset="11088104">Congress made the judgment that the... whatever additional burdens are required to admit handicapped children and integrate them into the normal public school experience is more than offset by the savings in that by being part of this normal experience, which is social as well as instructional, they are better prepared to be independent in later life, which means that for the rest of their lives they don't have to be paid, for example, supplemental security income, or they don't have to be paid as much; they don't have to be institutionalized; they don't have to have as many adults or as many publicly paid caretakers to assist them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.350" offset="11254452">And this also is... it's a policy judgment Congress made, for better or for worse.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.611" offset="11279530">Looking at that policy and trying to judge the facts of this case in terms of it, it's clear that... I think, that the balance should be struck in favor of Amber to provide this service, allow her to participate, and that this falls well within the meaning of the Act, especially as illuminated by the regulations involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.319" offset="11370331">And it also is a reasonable accommodation under the nondiscrimination against the handicapped statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3091.421" offset="12510733">I think that I can just summarize by going back to the original point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.341" offset="12526406">This is really an access case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.435" offset="12534766">This is a case that poses the question of whether a child who's capable of doing schoolwork in the public schools, who's entitled by law, will be given the simple and safe and inexpensive service that will permit her access and prevent her exclusion and segregation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3119.864" offset="12624522">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.565" offset="12639255">Let me answer one issue or, as counsel says, the only issue, and that is access.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.703" offset="12671856">If I read this Court's opinion in Rowley and if I read the intent and purpose of the Education of the Handicapped Act, it is... I don't find any... anything... any authority to say that it's to guarantee access to any particular, specific class, program or activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3156.240" offset="12769972">But as I believe this Court said in Rowley, it is access to special education and to an appropriate public education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.204" offset="12809887">The underlying theory or philosophy of the Education of the Handicapped Act, in addition to its purpose of providing for early identification, proper evaluation and appropriate placement, is the individualization of an education plan for a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.195" offset="12901838">And as Rowley again said, I believe in footnote 4 of that opinion, Congress recognized that not all children are going to be able to be safely educated in what is referred to as the least restrictive environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3208.966" offset="12980937">It recognizes the health and safety conditions of a child.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.887" offset="13000581">So to characterize the issue in this case as access to a particular classroom is to disregard a record made in this case since June of 1979 which has been always, until counsel's brief, whether or not medical treatment required to be prescribed by a private physician is mandated by Congress to be provided as a related service by the public schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.089" offset="13165361">That is the issue.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3256.746" stopTime="3270.425">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3256.746" offset="13172049">Well, I suppose... I suppose, Counsel, that physical therapy can often be by... on prescription of a physician and nonetheless required to be provided by the public school under the Education for the Handicapped Act.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="james_w_deatherage" startTime="3270.425" stopTime="3389.629">
            <label>Mr. James W. Deatherage</label>
            <text syncTime="3270.425" offset="13226697">Yes, Justice O'Connor, it may be, depending on the doctor's purpose in the prescription and to the degree whether it's related to benefitting from special education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.937" offset="13280823">But to merely prescribe a particular physical therapy may or may not in a given case fall within the requirements of the Education of the Handicapped Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.196" offset="13333799">Further, the recitation of physical therapy in the statute doesn't have the limiting language volume as medical services does, which says except for diagnosis and evaluation only.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.987" offset="13400986">As to what other courts deal with the extent or parameters of physical therapy, I would not represent to this Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.920" offset="13440692">But certainly, there would appear on the face of the statute exceptions, and there are in the state plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.277" offset="13470158">Another issue or a matter to keep... that's involved in this case is remembering what qualified Amber for special education under the Act in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.350" offset="13526478">That was an orthopedic impairment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.878" offset="13544555">That is what entitled her to special education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.064" offset="13565348">The medical treatment prescribed by the doctor in this case is for treatment of a condition completely unrelated to what qualifies her for special education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.746" offset="13624072">And there's never been a dispute in that in this case, and in fact, that has been stipulated to as to the orthopedic impairment, and that the neurogenic bladder to which this case is designed is not related to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3383.850" offset="13680496">Under the court's reasoning below, whatever--</text>

            <text syncTime="3389.629" offset="13703588">Is it your position that a child with the spina bifida condition cannot qualify as a handicapped child under the Act?</text>

            <text syncTime="3397.140" offset="13733577">--No, Justice O'Connor, I'm not saying it cannot qualify.</text>
            <text syncTime="3400.997" offset="13749041">I only say the record in this case indicates that only the orthopedic impairment with some speech impairment is what qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3409.229" offset="13781956">In another case it very well could, in a more severe case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3413.195" offset="13797838">May I ask what the orthopedic impairment was?</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.321" offset="13822289">There seems to be a great mystery about it?</text>

            <label>Mr. James W. Deatherage</label>
            <text syncTime="3421.037" offset="13829185">Developmental delays in gross and fine motor skills, which is why the physical therapy was designed for the improvement of gross motor skills, so the child can benefit from special education, can participate in physical activities, i.e., physical education classes offered by the school district; occupational therapy designed to develop and improve fine motor skills in which Amber was developmentally delayed, so she can grasp a pencil to write, so some day she can learn to grasp a catheter and take care of her own self.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3457.634" offset="13975575">Well, we've had comments all through the argument about an orthopedic impairment, and no one ever said what it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.002" offset="13997100">Because it seemed to me we're talking basically about a urological problem, and urology and orthopedics are somewhat different.</text>

            <label>Mr. James W. Deatherage</label>
            <text syncTime="3472.174" offset="14033776">Correct, Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.734" offset="14039941">And my point is that the urology problem is not what qualifies her for special education, but is what the respondent seeks the medical treatment for.</text>

            <text syncTime="3482.902" offset="14076617">Well, to the extent this case turns on whether... whether under state law administering CIC is a medical service, aren't we... aren't we entitled to rely on the court of appeals for that?</text>

            <text syncTime="3498.726" offset="14139938">Justice White, let me answer it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3502.895" offset="14156656">As I said in my opening argument, the history of this case has been a battle as between whether this is a medical service or whether it is a school health service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.997" offset="14209006">We submit to the Court that the question is whether or not this medical treatment is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3525.792" offset="14248189">It's not who may be qualified to perform it under either the federal act or the state act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3532.632" offset="14275566">It is the nature and purpose of the treatment.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3535.990" offset="14289045">Well, so let's suppose that it was... that you just agreed that this was not a medical service within the... within the meaning of... of the... of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.970" offset="14332930">It was not medical service.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.030" offset="14341185">Then would you concede that this is a... another supportive service?</text>

            <text syncTime="3561.403" offset="14390609">--In this case I cannot concede that, because the district court found that the school could not lawfully provide this treatment without a doctor's prescription.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3571.195" stopTime="3590.267">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3571.195" offset="14429793">Well, I know, but the court... that may be true, but the court of appeals nevertheless said it was not a medical service within the meaning of the Education for the Handicapped Act, didn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="3584.285" offset="14482142">And that nothing in state law made it so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.984" offset="14500950">It had to hold that.</text>

            <label>Mr. James W. Deatherage</label>
            <text syncTime="3590.267" offset="14506070">The court of appeals had no facts and did not have the facts that this Court has before it now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.826" offset="14524356">It had no record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3595.606" offset="14527490">But in that regard, Justice Goldberg in the Tatro I opinion in his three-pronged test in dealing whether a life support system is a related service, said that excluded from the term "related services" are those health-related activities which must be performed by a licensed physician that are not provided to determine a child's medically related handicapping condition which results in the child's need for special education.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.547" offset="14663223">By looking at Texas Medical Association brief requested by the trial court, made a part of its memorandum opinion, page 25 and 6 of our brief are listed numerous services of a licensed physician that are required in this case in order for the school district to provide what is prescribed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.144" offset="14773668">And we have listed some seven or eight Texas Medical Association--</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.675" offset="14791745">So by... under the Fifth Circuit's own reasoning and its exclusion, in this case this medical record falls within that exclusion, because it requires the services of a licensed physician.</text>
            <text syncTime="3681.901" offset="14872620">Under the reasoning of this... of this case and of the courts below, whether the treatment prescribed by the doctor is simple or complex, whether it is costly or cheap, will have to be provided by the public school, whether that treatment might be sterile catheterization, which prior to CIC was considered the treatment of choice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3712.263" offset="14994142">If a doctor, who may not be knowledgeable of the current standard of practice, prescribes sterile catheterization or another procedure to empty the bladder called purveying the bladder, and delegates that treatment to the school, under the reasoning of the courts below, the school will have to provide it or will have to challenge that prescribing physician over his standard of medical practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.250" offset="15126008">They'll either have to do it or be subjected to having knowledge it's not the current treatment of choice and yet going on and doing what the doctor prescribed.</text>
