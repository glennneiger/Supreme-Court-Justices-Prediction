            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="145800">We'll hear arguments next in Monsanto Company against Spray-Rite Service Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.197" offset="182580">Mr. Bartlit, you may proceed when you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Fred H. Bartlit, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="13.150" offset="198358">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.683" offset="212464">This case is the first opportunity for this Court to consider the antitrust illegality of non-price vertical restraints since the 1977 Sylvania decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.990" offset="265754">Sylvania recognized that non-price vertical restraints are not per se illegal even though they may have some effect on price.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.469" offset="315596">Sylvania said that the rule of reason would apply to such restraints, and noted that there will be no departure from the rule of reason unless there is a demonstrable economic effect, not formalistic line drawing.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.449" offset="383514">Despite Sylvania, the Seventh Circuit found non-price vertical restraints to be per se unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.035" offset="413921">They did that, Petitioner urges, by using two rules of law that seriously cut away from and limit the usefulness of Sylvania to businessmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.903" offset="461359">What the Seventh Circuit did was this: the Seventh Circuit said that the non-price restraints in this case were part of a price-fixing conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.830" offset="505036">They used a rule in determining whether a conspiracy existed which makes it very easy to find a resale price fixing conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.217" offset="550593">The Seventh Circuit said that all you need is an interest in a manufacturer on the part of price, a concern about price, which you will almost always have, coupled with complaints from distributors followed by a distributor termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.878" offset="613287">In this case, of course, the situation was exacerbated because the complaint occurred... the last complaint of record occurred 15 months prior to the termination, and in the interval between the last complaint and the termination, there was a renewal of the distributor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="135.460" stopTime="146.016">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="135.460" offset="687580">Mr. Bartlit, you're not suggesting, are you, that the only evidence before the Court of Appeals were complaints from distributors plus the fact of termination by Monsanto?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="fred_h_bartlit_jr" startTime="146.016" stopTime="594.909">
            <label>Mr. Fred H. Bartlit, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="146.016" offset="729793">No, Justice Rehnquist, I'm not.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.886" offset="737317">There was other evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.469" offset="743586">We don't believe it was sufficient to go to the jury on the issue of conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.701" offset="760513">But the Court used a standard for finding a conspiracy which was a very slender standard and made it easy to get to a jury in almost any business context on the question of the underlying conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.390" offset="811296">Then the Seventh Circuit, having made it easy for a plaintiff to get to the jury on the question of whether there was the underlying conspiracy made it even easier for the jury to find that the programs in question were part of the conspiracy, because the court didn't require that there be any evidence at all linking the programs in question to the conspiracy.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.926" offset="909411">The result is that it is now very easy for a plaintiff to get to the jury any time a manufacturer uses procompetitive, non-price programs like these.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.824" offset="965000">We think that it's particularly troublesome in this case where the economic effect of the programs was demonstrated and where the programs are so much like those in Sylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.284" offset="1014842">Sylvania gave an example of the kind of non-price program that might be procompetitive, even though it was a restriction.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.159" offset="1050368">The Court in Sylvania said that there might be instances where a manufacturer who had a new product might find it worthwhile to motivate or inspire distributors into engaging in non-price promotional activities, devoting their labor, devoting their capital to selling this new product in order to get the product off the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.004" offset="1141797">Of course, that's what happened here in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.056" offset="1154022">Monsanto had a new product, a series of herbicides.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.339" offset="1171054">There names are Ramrod and Lasso.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.370" offset="1179204">They were good products.</text>
            <text syncTime="260.151" offset="1186309">They'd been around for a number of years, but Monsanto hadn't been able to get off the ground with these products.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.554" offset="1212014">In 1968 Monsanto had about 3 percent of the soybean market and about 15 percent of the corn market.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.201" offset="1242525">Monsanto was facing large, dominant, entrenched competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.923" offset="1261438">They had one main competitor in corn, a Swiss or German company that had 70 percent of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.438" offset="1287456">Their competitors in beans had between them about 70 percent of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.530" offset="1307831">Monsanto management took a look at the situation and tried to figure out why if the products were good hadn't they been able to get off the ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.819" offset="1349000">They determined that it was a question of customer knowledge.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.030" offset="1365823">Herbicides can kill corn, they can kill crops.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.252" offset="1378780">Farmers were sticking with...</text>
            <text syncTime="310.012" offset="1385780">"Dance with them what brung you. "</text>
            <text syncTime="311.945" offset="1393513">as I think Bear Bryant once said.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.494" offset="1399678">They were happy with the products that had done the job in the past, and they didn't want to take a chance.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.309" offset="1419008">Monsanto felt that they had to put in some programs which would encourage distributors, wholesale distributors to get out in the grassroots, in the farm belt and get across the story of Monsanto products, and that's what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.221" offset="1486613">Monsanto put in a whole series of sophisticated marketing programs all designed to create an incentive for the distributors to get out and do the job of educating the retail stores and educating the farmers.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.081" offset="1550038">Of course, the farmers would go to grain elevators and feed stores and little stores throughout the farm belt; and it was thought necessary to have distributors who would go out and do the job.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.316" offset="1587028">The programs were interesting.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.097" offset="1598104">They ranged from Monsanto actually paying cash money to distributors who would convince the employees in the feed stores and grain elevators to go to technical herbicide schools and learn about the product.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.757" offset="1652752">Monsanto paid cash money for distributors who would go out and get the products on the shelves early in the season so they'd be there when the farmers came in.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.955" offset="1689532">Monsanto had a territorialization and a shipping policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.416" offset="1711371">Distributors were assigned territories, 15 or 20 distributors in a territory, not exclusive, and distributors could only pick up at shipping points within their territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.023" offset="1753793">So they would be focused on the area in which they were in, and they would try to do a good job at developing their territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.148" offset="1778349">Monsanto also announced... and this was the first thing they did... Petitioner announced that we want distributors who will get out in the farm belt and do the grassroots job of working with the retail stores and educating them.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.189" offset="1842505">All distributors got that notice a year in advance in 1967.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.920" offset="1861418">Monsanto told distributors if you're not willing to do that, we're not going to work with you in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.664" offset="1884406">And Respondent in this case, Respondent's president testified he understood that Monsanto... he knew what Monsanto wanted, and he understood what they wanted, and he knew they were serious about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.742" offset="1924739">The result of this sophisticated series of marketing programs was very procompetitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.478" offset="1959638">Plaintiff's expert testified that the programs did have the effect desired by Monsanto.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.891" offset="1989313">The programs did tend to focus the distributor's sales attention on the little retail stores throughout the farm belt.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.059" offset="2022019">And, of course, the market share figures, the bottom line market share figures show that the programs work.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.671" offset="2048455">The corn market went from a market in which Monsanto had 15 percent and Geigy had 70 percent to a much more competitive market.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.828" offset="2089101">Monsanto went up to almost 30 percent, and Geigy down to 50 or 55 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.301" offset="2106969">The same thing happened in soybeans.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.314" offset="2115015">The plaintiff's expert testified that the reasons for Monsanto's dramatic improvement in the four-year period from 1968 to 1972 were: good products, which we'd always had; emphasis on technical sales; product promotion; and Monsanto hired a lot of salesmen.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.718" offset="2208638">So we know that the vertical programs in this case actually worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.740" offset="2228700">Furthermore, while Sylvania acknowledged that to achieve these kinds of gains in interbrand competition between brands of two different manufacturers, Geigy and Monsanto, there might have to be some loss of intrabrand competition... that is, competition between Monsanto's various distributors.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.156" offset="2322322">It doesn't look like there was much diminution of intrabrand competition in this case, because what happened is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.152" offset="2358371">This market had always been characterized by deep, intense price discounting, and it continued throughout the period of time from 1968 to 1972.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.569" offset="2404033">Indeed, prices were lower in 1972, in 1971 than they'd been back in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.494" offset="2431723">So we didn't see a situation where the prices that were paid went up during this period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.349" offset="2455129">Similarly, there isn't any evidence of any pattern of terminating distributors who were deep price cutters.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.824" offset="2489088">It's true that the distributor who was terminated in this case had been a price cutter.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.128" offset="2506224">He'd been a price cutter since 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.618" offset="2516256">Nothing changed.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.078" offset="2522107">He'd been--</text>

            <text syncTime="619.677" offset="2624507">Now, certainly the jury was entitled to believe that.</text>

            <text syncTime="650.596" offset="2748118">I can't.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.027" offset="2749895">The evidence... the evidence showed that, by way of background, that the plaintiff in this case made 75 percent of his sales to only six customers; that he testified that he didn't have salesmen; that, as the appendix shows, he advertised that he... his margins were so low because he sold as a broker that he didn't have the money to provide the services which he admitted were required in this technical market.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.914" offset="2865356">That's at the appendix at page 101, his own advertisement.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.600" offset="2892105">But nevertheless, there was evidence in which the jury was entitled to disregard all of that evidence and determine that Monsanto had a price motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="694.594" offset="2924079">The effect of the termination, of course, there was no effect on prices in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.609" offset="2952187">There was vigorous price competition at all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.612" offset="2964203">Plaintiff's expert testified at trial... and this is a quote... that the market was</text>
            <text syncTime="711.227" offset="2990639">"highly competitive at all times before and after the termination... highly competitive at all times before and after the termination. "</text>
            <text syncTime="719.992" offset="3025748">So we didn't have a situation where products were in the hands of discounters, and after the decisions were made and the programs were implemented suddenly people were paying a lot more for toasters or mixmasters or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.930" offset="3073500">That was not the case we had here.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.871" offset="3081232">The programs were unusual because it was not strictly a territorialization.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.846" offset="3109131">We also actually paid distributors to do the work that we thought they had to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.569" offset="3128043">Now, at trial plaintiffs agreed on the record that there was no claim that these programs violated the rule of reason, nor could they have, I suppose, in light of the evidence showing what happened in the marketplace.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.149" offset="3198365">Instead, plaintiffs said that they were part of price fixing, and that without the price fixing, the programs would have been okay, but there was a price fixing conspiracy.</text>

            <text syncTime="780.631" offset="3268269">Now, the key to this case and the reason why this case threatens the ability of businessmen to use Sylvania is this: the evidence which plaintiffs relied on and the evidence which the Court relied on in finding a conspiracy is the kind of evidence which one would expect to see in a marketplace where you have people like Monsanto trying to stimulate competition with other brands through the use of programs like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.908" offset="3381431">Obviously, on the fundamental question of whether there was a price fixing conspiracy, the statement of the court below that all one needs are complaints, price concern, followed by a termination fifteen months later.</text>

            <text syncTime="1008.760" offset="4180778">Plaintiffs relied at trial and rely before this Court on two kinds of evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="1018.398" offset="4219335">One would expect any manufacturer to be concerned about prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.271" offset="4234799">One would expect a manufacturer like Monsanto who wanted to make sure that distributors had the wherewithal to engage in non-price competition to be interested in margins.</text>

            <text syncTime="1035.980" offset="4289656">Secondly, the... the court relied on internal Monsanto documents which showed that in putting these programs into the field, Monsanto was considering the sizes, the margins, was considering all aspects of pricing, as one would expect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.843" offset="4373144">The result of this decision was that, a) distribution systems are, as a practical matter, frozen.</text>

            <label>Mr. William F. Baxter</label>
            <text syncTime="1107.797" offset="4576899">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.237" offset="4590691">I am here amicus on behalf of the United States government, and I think this case is here because there is an important and fundamental conflict between the policy that is reflected in the Sylvania decision and the policy that is reflected in Dr. Miles and its progeny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.565" offset="4692047">Each of those two rules is addressed to the form of agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.180" offset="4718482">Non-price agreements are to be judged by the rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.681" offset="4732484">Price agreements are illegal per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.643" offset="4744291">The conflict arises because non-price agreements work only through and to the extent that they have an effect on intrabrand pricing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.044" offset="4805940">In almost all commercial contexts the two different types of agreement will have the same function, the same purpose, and the same basic economic effects, and accordingly, will leave the same evidentiary footprints, if I might put it that way, so that it becomes empirically impossible unless we have evidence about the form of agreement to know which it was that was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.077" offset="4942091">If both these rules are to remain operative... and I assume for the purposes of my presentation today that both are to remain operative... it is necessary for this Court to build a fence of some sort, a fence that will produce contained enemies, if not good neighbors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.180" offset="5030489">And I offer to the Court the following reconciliation of these two bodies of doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.686" offset="5060478">If a supplier adopts a bona fide program, distribution program embodying non-price restrictions, and if that program is reasonably addressed to an identifiable distributional problem such as the dissemination of information at the point of sale, then the case must be judged by the rule of reason unless the plaintiff is able to show by direct or circumstantial evidence that there was an explicit agreement about the prices that the distributors were to charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.649" offset="5268308">Now, if I may stress what I regard as the most critical of these points I have made here, namely that non-price and price agreements have essentially identical functional consequences, I would like to say there's nothing particularly new or startling about that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.035" offset="5369872">Indeed, the shadow of that proposition appeared in the Sylvania decision itself, most visibly in Justice White's concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1317.602" offset="5416161">And I ask you to consider with me the exact role that was seen for non-price agreements in Sylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1326.200" offset="5450538">By hypothesis, a supplier has decided that a program involving non-price restrictions is necessary for him to succeed in interbrand competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.978" offset="5513650">Now, what is it that these non-price restrictions are to achieve?</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.201" offset="5534548">They are to achieve, as Sylvania explicitly recognized, an attenuation of intrabrand price competition, an attenuation that is sufficient to allow distributors who are complying and incurring the costs of complying with non-price restrictions to cover those costs with the resulting intrabrand prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="1382.955" offset="5677594">If someone else not complying with those rules is beating intrabrand prices down below a level which is sufficient to cover the compliance with the programs desired by the supplier, the non-price program must fail in its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.494" offset="5779681">And therefore, if Sylvania is to have any operational meaning as opposed to existing as a mere theoretical possibility in the literature, it must enable a supplier under these circumstances working together with his distributors to build an operational non-price program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.513" offset="5907785">We were told in Broadcast Music that the characterization of conduct that was arguably subject to a per se rule was not to be determined by literal definitions but by a sensible, functional approach to the question of whether the behavior had desirable efficiency effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.023" offset="6025859">The lesson in Broadcast Music in this context, I urge upon the Court, is to recognize the need for functioning a fence of the kind I have described so that both the Sylvania decision and Dr. Miles and its progeny may themselves have functional roles to play in the shaping of our distribution systems.</text>

            <text syncTime="1532.003" offset="6273709">Well, it would depend, Justice O'Connor, on the characteristics of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.127" offset="6298264">In a large number of cases... I take for an example the Cernuto decision in the Third Circuit below... there is no evidence that there was an articulated non-price set of restrictions put into effect, no evidence that there was a point of sale problem that needed to be addressed by point of sale non-price restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.704" offset="6400559">Under those circumstances, Dr. Miles, Parke-Davis, et cetera, would continue to apply in just the way they apply today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.460" offset="6435563">But, as I indicated in what I proposed as an accommodation, if a supplier was able to show that he had adopted an articulated program involving non-price constraints addressed to an identifiable problem of the sort that Sylvania recognized, a distributional problem that is appropriately addressed by non-price restraints, then under those circumstances a plaintiff would have to show that in addition to agreeing on the non-price restrictions, there was an explicit agreement with respect to price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.817" offset="6609016">It would change the burden of proof faced by a plaintiff in this subcategory of cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="1780.796" offset="7268974">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.518" offset="7287782">This Court decided the Sylvania case in a decision written by Justice Powell in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.287" offset="7342848">That case started with the proposition that the district court had committed error in giving the appropriate instruction to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.176" offset="7394466">The district court was asked in Sylvania to give the jury a rule of reason instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.411" offset="7427380">The district court in Sylvania refused to give a rule of reason instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1826.004" offset="7449741">The case went up, and this Court decided that a rule of reason instruction should have been given.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.748" offset="7472729">That was in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.912" offset="7489447">Now, Mr. Yapp started trial in Rockford, Illinois in 1980 in January.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.097" offset="7522153">At no time during that trial did Monsanto tell Judge Roskowski, the trial judge, that he ought to submit a rule of reason instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.457" offset="7575547">Indeed, the trial court was instructed on this issue that it is per se illegal for a manufacturer to utilize territorial restrictions pursuant to a comprehensive price fixing plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1877.609" offset="7656213">Therefore, if you find that the defendant basically agreed on a stabilization plan and the resale price maintenance was part of that or part of a plan to restrict access to the product, then you've got to find essentially for the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1901.185" offset="7750463">There was no objection to that instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.785" offset="7760912">Indeed, the word "pursuant to" in the instruction was suggested by Monsanto's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.309" offset="7782959">Further, the court was... the jury was instructed that under the per se rule, you don't consider business justifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.306" offset="7826949">You don't consider the reasonableness of these restraints.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.600" offset="7844190">When this case was in the Seventh Circuit, Monsanto told the Seventh Circuit that they should apply a rule of reason and the instruction was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1938.789" offset="7900928">That's the first point they made in the brief they filed in the Seventh Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.705" offset="7932589">We're here now on another issue it seems, but how are we going to try cases if the district judge isn't first given the opportunity of ruling on the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.368" offset="8007194">Perhaps Mr. Baxter should have tried this case and said to Judge Roskowski in January of 1980 please instruct the jury in the following way in helping you determine how you apply the facts to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.670" offset="8072396">But that isn't what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.530" offset="8079919">That isn't what happened at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1985.270" offset="8086816">Indeed, in this case, in the reply brief Monsanto now says on page 4 of their reply brief that they do not argue the jury instructions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1997.599" offset="8136135">If they do not argue the jury instructions, I respectfully suggest to this Court that the jury had every right to do what they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.966" offset="8173647">The jury had ample evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.887" offset="8185245">Mr. Bartlit's statement to this Court is not a statement of the inferences that the jury had a fair opportunity to resolve in favor of Spray-Rite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.723" offset="8228608">That's the same statement Mr. Bartlit made in opening statement to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.138" offset="8250342">It's the same statement he makes now.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.079" offset="8258074">The fact of the matter is if Monsanto stabilized the price of Lasso... Lasso was a new product; it came out in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.177" offset="8298407">Lasso determined to get rid of price cutting on this productive new product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.058" offset="8317947">The jury found that Lasso was in fact a success.</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.300" offset="8334979">The reason it was a success is because it was proprietary, and the farmer is the person who had to pay the different margin as a result of a price stabilization plan that Monsanto visited upon this industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.951" offset="8389522">The testimony of Mr. McCormick, which we've cited at length in our brief, is a classic case of how you go about to stabilize a market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.949" offset="8437588">He contacted every distributor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2075.871" offset="8449186">He got every distributor to agree to the procedure and those that didn't they cancelled, they coerced.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.885" offset="8473323">They told them directly if you sell out of this territory which we've arbitrarily set up as a primary area of responsibility, if you sell outside this area, we're going to not renew your contract next year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.753" offset="8528807">They did the same thing to our client, Mr. Yapp, twice.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2099.896" offset="8545317">Well, Mr. Foote, is it your position that Monsanto could not unilaterally discontinue the respondent here because of dissatisfaction with his price activities, his price cutting?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edward_l_foote" startTime="2114.015" stopTime="2420.415">
            <label>Mr. Edward L. Foote</label>
            <text syncTime="2114.015" offset="8601846">Under Colgate, Your Honor, as counsel, all of us agree, you can unilaterally do about anything in this field.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.831" offset="8637059">Our point, and the jury believed and found a special interrogatory submitted by counsel for Monsanto, that the termination was part of a stabilization plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2134.078" offset="8682094">That is a jury question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.240" offset="8694737">I didn't know, and I suspect the Court very seldom has cases in which the issue before the Court is the sufficiency of the evidence to go to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.497" offset="8731727">But I'll be very happy to reargue that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.988" offset="8741653">There's an ample amount of evidence to go to the jury under the established law with respect to the agreements of other distributors, tacit agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2158.745" offset="8780732">As an example, Justice Rehnquist, when Mr. Fischer, the gentleman terminated, my client, said he was doing it because of price complaints, that was November of 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2177.516" offset="8855860">The fall season had begun for the fall and winter of 1968 and '69 for the spring planting, and Monsanto had its program in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.734" offset="8904657">They called in all the distributors, and they told the distributors... Mr. McCormick's testimony and Mr. Dilley's testimony is absolutely explicit... they called them all in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.151" offset="8950319">They said we're going to stabilize the price of a new product, Lasso.</text>
            <text syncTime="2205.274" offset="8966829">We want you to follow the prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.106" offset="8978218">We want you to follow our suggested prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.647" offset="8988353">They did follow the suggested prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.200" offset="9002564">At the same time that Mr. Fischer was telling our client that he was terminated because of price complaints, Mr. Bailey, who is like... Mr. Bailey is like in the General Motors case that came out of California, there were Chevrolet dealers who wanted to get rid of the discount houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.298" offset="9106949">They asked General Motors to help them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.961" offset="9121578">Mr. Bailey was like those Chevrolet dealers who wanted the discount eliminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.194" offset="9150522">He, having met with the management at a district meeting in St. Louis, went back to Minneapolis and wrote a memorandum to the dealers saying we've finally arrived at a situation where Monsanto recognizes it's got to take care of this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.669" offset="9240383">Their stores... they had competing stores... are going to use the suggested prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.763" offset="9268804">A blessing really has fallen on us.</text>
            <text syncTime="2284.096" offset="9282179">None of us will obviously cut the price because it will risk termination, continuity of our dealership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.521" offset="9311854">It is a document that so reeks with a kind of antitrust behavior that when Monsanto found out about it, they wrote them and said gee, we really didn't say that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.649" offset="9360337">But that's what he testified to in front of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.111" offset="9370159">And he said when I left that meeting, I knew that Monsanto wanted me to use the resale prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2313.034" offset="9397849">And he was delighted to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.007" offset="9405790">He was like the folks, the Chevrolet dealers who wanted to get rid of another kind of an outlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.331" offset="9435047">Now, our client was the other kind of an outlet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.113" offset="9446228">So was Mr. Mulvahill who did more for the farmers up in Minnesota and North Dakota than anybody.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.329" offset="9479038">He was the Yapp of that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.549" offset="9483949">And they cancelled him after telling him to his face, if you don't stay in this little territory that we've sent you, we're going to cancel you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.857" offset="9525222">You can't--</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.838" offset="9529088">After they terminated my client they had face-to-face meetings with him in which they said if you sell to Mr. Yapp, we'll terminate you.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.063" offset="9562002">Don't sell to Mr. Yapp.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.663" offset="9568376">So he didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2356.965" offset="9573601">He had to acquiesce to that form of activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2360.208" offset="9586558">So when we talk about a statement of facts, it is true that the jury could have believed that all of these programs were innocent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.261" offset="9626786">They didn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.452" offset="9635563">My own view is the jury had no alternative under the instruction it was given... it was not objected to... to find that these primary areas of responsibility were created as part of a plan to help stabilize the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2390.665" offset="9708393">In fact, Mr. McCormick, the representative who called on these various dealers, distributors, said that's how we interpreted it, that the primary area of responsibility meant they had to sell in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.188" offset="9774535">They couldn't sell outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.617" offset="9780177">Why not?</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.538" offset="9783939">Because they didn't want people like Mulvahill and other discounters and price discounters to go outside their area and discount the price.</text>

            <text syncTime="2431.722" offset="9872651">Others it had to push on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.355" offset="9879129">It's a classic case, as Justice Brennan some years ago in Parke-Davis talked about a situation where some of the drugstores, some of the Parke-Davis outlets were willing to go along with the suggested prices; others were unwilling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2451.165" offset="9950391">They had to be talked to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.216" offset="9958646">And those that were unwilling didn't get any product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2455.907" offset="9969408">It's exactly the same as we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.060" offset="9977976">It's the same situation I respectfully suggest the Court considered in the General Motors case.</text>

            <text syncTime="2462.673" offset="9996471">Yeah, but where did the impetus, the first impetus, according to the evidence in this case, for the price stabilization come from, from Monsanto or from the dealer?</text>

            <text syncTime="2471.619" offset="10032207">I think originally it came from the dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.301" offset="10042969">The dealers did not... any of the dealers did not like to have price competition between territories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.886" offset="10077242">They complained to Monsanto about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.890" offset="10093333">One of the top people at Monsanto, Mr. Arvin, then came to my client's door and said you are not using dealer prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.934" offset="10125516">You are selling into another area at low prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2497.706" offset="10136592">And he acknowledged it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.047" offset="10141921">He said well, if you don't get your prices up, we're going to cancel your distributorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.249" offset="10158744">One and a half years later, acting again on complaints, this time from Mr. Hopkins, the same gentleman who signed our client's dealer agreement, a Mr. Bone, appears, and he says to Mr. Yapp on a telephone, I'm sending you our dealer prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2523.853" offset="10241186">You're not using them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3193.512" offset="12919782">So the jury found everything in our favor, because they couldn't have done anything else after listening to Mr. McCormick's testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="3223.048" offset="13037960">And I think a review of the record, which, of course, this Court doesn't want me to do, will support that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.842" offset="13061157">I only get into it in response to an opening argument which is a statement of facts that the jury rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.370" offset="13095220">Lasso ended up with a 14 percent margin after the price stabilization plan was put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3249.098" offset="13142136">Before that, Mr. Yapp, my client, sold at a 6 percent margin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.532" offset="13171916">Most... when Mr. Yapp was competing in this area, the farmers got the difference between 6 and 7 percent and 14 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.237" offset="13214652">That's what the jury had a right to conclude.</text>
            <text syncTime="3271.371" offset="13231266">Further, that other companies that manufacture herbicides operated on a 14 percent margin.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.187" offset="13266479">That's in the appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.907" offset="13273376">So the notion that there wasn't an effect on the market only can be arrived at by rejecting our evidence and accepting inferences from Monsanto, which obviously a point I'm not going to debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.859" offset="13345160">I think Monsanto's counsel would agree that I have the right to have the evidence construed most favorably to our side.</text>

            <text syncTime="3317.961" offset="13417571">It is true that Judge Power, after talking about the allegations in Sealy and the allegations in Sylvania, says that mere... uses the expression "mere allegation".</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.244" offset="13546721">It is seriously contended that this Court ought to censure Judge Bower by his expression of allegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.629" offset="13584233">In the petition filed in this Court by the United States, they suggested in a footnote that it probably out to say "proof" instead of "allegation".</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.197" offset="13626551">Well, I respectfully suggest that that is a red herring.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.781" offset="13648912">What in the world... in reading page 1237 of 684 Fed Second, you've got to conclude that Judge Bower, who is a former United States Attorney, a district court judge, and a court of appeals judge for many years, doesn't want the world to believe that he thinks that all you have to do in a case is make allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.643" offset="13732295">That's the thrust of what they would like... that's one of the reasons why they asked this Court to take the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.028" offset="13757895">I believe that that's the reason the Court took the case; that it should follow practice it has done in other instances and dismiss the rest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3714.554" offset="15003936">Page 3983 of the record shows Monsanto submitted the instruction but withdrew it when Spray-Rite abandoned any claim that the programs were unlawful under the rule of reason.</text>
