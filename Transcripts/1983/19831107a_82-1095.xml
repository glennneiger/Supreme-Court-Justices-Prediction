            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149269">Mr. Wellington, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_d_wellington" startTime="76.048" stopTime="279.128">
            <label>Mr. Michael D. Wellington</label>
            <text syncTime="76.048" offset="453439">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="77.666" offset="459917">This case arises in the context of the ten-year effort on the part of the states to establish constitutionally valid death penalty laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.789" offset="500355">Harris was tried under California's 1977 statute enacted in response to this Court's series of decisions in the Gregg series of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.578" offset="543509">And, his claims that the California's statute was unconstitutional, in part because its perceived lack of proportionality review had been denied at all state levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.904" offset="596799">His direct appeal was affirmed and his habeas corpus petition was narrowly denied by the California Supreme Court which, at that point, vacated its stay of execution and essentially remitted him to the executioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.847" offset="660642">The United States District Court also denied habeas corpus relief, holding, as the California courts had, that proportionality review, at least as envisioned by Harris, was not demanded by the federal Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="143.107" offset="721664">After the District Court denied relief, appeal was taken to the Ninth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.279" offset="750294">The Ninth Circuit issued the ruling that we are concerned with here, ruling that this Court's decisions in Gregg and in Proffitt commanded the conducting of a proportionality review by the state, essentially commanding a comparative proportionality review, and also holding that the California courts had on their own required the holding of a proportionality review.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.145" offset="849769">Now, we sought cert. from the Ninth Circuit holding to clarify, and in my view, correct the holding of the Ninth Circuit that the Gregg cases required proportionality review.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.052" offset="901387">And specifically to correct the holding that California cannot execute Mr. Harris until that review has been conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.176" offset="937958">There are four points that I am hoping to raise here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.045" offset="949347">The first one, in response to Professor Amsterdam's invitation to this Court to not decide the issue, I am going to urge that the issue must be decided on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.234" offset="994173">Second, I wish to address the concept of proportionality and what that term means in this case and to urge that proportionality in this context means precisely what this Court said that it means at the end of last term in Sollin v. Helm and in some previous cases this Court has decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.433" offset="1078915">The third point that I am hoping to reach is the question of what review is necessary on the issue of proportionality and I am going to urge that the review of that issue is no different than the review commanded of any other constitutional issue; that is it is an issue that should be addressed by the Court if raised by counsel, if raised by the parties, if raised on a supportive record.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.715" offset="1180061">And, finally, I am going to urge that this Court should rule as a matter of law that death for personally and intentionally inflicted murder is not disproportionate, something the Court has come very close to doing on two prior occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.343" offset="1250591">Now, I would like to begin--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="279.128" offset="1265742">Mr. Wellington, I would like to ask you if at some time you would explain to us in your view what is the procedure that California courts follow in the review of death cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.805" offset="1328436">It isn't altogether clear to me precisely what it is that the California courts, the appellate courts at the highest level, would look to.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_d_wellington" startTime="305.029" stopTime="351.940">
            <label>Mr. Michael D. Wellington</label>
            <text syncTime="305.029" offset="1369292">--Certainly, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.229" offset="1374098">Under the California statutes, every death sentence is automatically appealed to the California Supreme Court and that court reviews any contentions of error raised by the defendant, the appellant, in that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.488" offset="1443166">That is the scope of review in that court.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.456" offset="1455078">Essentially, it is the same as with any other appeal to the California Supreme Court with the one exception that in death-sentence cases each death-sentence defendant has an automatic right to have his issues heard by the California Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.937" offset="1528952">So, the court reviews the issues that are raised by the parties, raised by the defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.757" offset="1552253">That is what happened here, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="351.940" stopTime="360.379">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="351.940" offset="1556956">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.440" offset="1558941">And, if the defendant seeks a proportionality review, then that court would make it?</text>
            <text syncTime="359.094" offset="1585586">Is that what you are saying?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_d_wellington" startTime="360.379" stopTime="396.469">
            <label>Mr. Michael D. Wellington</label>
            <text syncTime="360.379" offset="1590706">What I am saying, Your Honor... I am saying that in essence and perhaps I had best step back just for a second to explain what I perceive proportionality review to be, to explain how the California courts are constituted to give it and has been giving it, in fact, where it has been asked for.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.277" offset="1670327">That is that I say proportionality review is an addressing by either the California Supreme Court or this Court in an appropriate case of the proportionality of the sentence actually meted out by the sentencing authority and that review--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="396.469" offset="1735111">Proportionality to the crime.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael D. Wellington</label>
            <text syncTime="397.436" offset="1738977">--Proportionality in the way this Court defined proportionality last term in Sollin v. Helm which includes, Your Honor an examination of whether it is proportional to the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.610" offset="1783698">One of the points I made in my brief, and I think it is crucial to this decision, is that proportionality as this Court defined it very carefully last term and as this Court has used the concept in its previous cases, Endman v. Florida and Coker v. Georgia, is exactly, precisely the same proportionality analysis that the California Supreme Court has used for over a decade, first announced in the early '70's in In re Lynch.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.315" offset="1910445">It uses precisely the same three steps, even announced in precisely the same order as this Court has.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="447.319" stopTime="458.443">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="447.319" offset="1938448">May I ask, further on Justice O'Connor's question, does that mean they do not, in the California appellate system, compare this sentence with other similar cases throughout the state?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_d_wellington" startTime="458.443" stopTime="506.608">
            <label>Mr. Michael D. Wellington</label>
            <text syncTime="458.443" offset="1982960">Not on what Professor Amsterdam has called a cross-case comparative basis, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.014" offset="2009292">The primary distinction, I believe, between the kind of proportionality analysis that Harris is urging and that that we are urging is that... And, the Ninth Circuit, of course, agreed with Harris' position, is that the Ninth Circuit position involves an examination of all of the aspects of each case, all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the case before the court, compared them with all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances with every other... either every other death penalty case or, under some argument, every other death eligible case that has arisen in the state since the drafting of the statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael D. Wellington</label>
            <text syncTime="528.456" offset="2262993">That is apparent from the Ninth Circuit opinion.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="530.575" offset="2271561">Okay.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_d_wellington" startTime="531.258" stopTime="688.376">
            <label>Mr. Michael D. Wellington</label>
            <text syncTime="531.258" offset="2274278">The Ninth Circuit read two California Supreme Court cases, Frierson and Jackson, to constitute a promise by the State of California to conduct proportionality review.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.383" offset="2318791">I do not see any reasonable reading of either Frierson or Jackson that says that.</text>
            <text syncTime="548.537" offset="2343346">What Frierson and Jackson actually said is three things, in fact, when addressed with the question... faced with the question of whether the Constitution required proportionality review and whether the California statute was unconstitutional for its failure to include the proportionality review.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.533" offset="2427356">The California Supreme Court said first that they do not read the majority of the Justices' opinions in Gregg to require the proportionality review.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.472" offset="2463091">Second, that, nonetheless, under California law, a disproportionate sentence would constitute error and what they referred to as well established proportionality principles, reference to the Lynch case, they were fully capable of addressing the issue of proportionality and that they had recognized in the past that that was part of California's jurisprudence.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.205" offset="2570089">An examination of California Supreme Court cases, both death penalty cases and non-death penalty cases, makes it absolutely apparent that they do not conduct that review automatically in each case.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.847" offset="2616587">They conduct the review when the issue is raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.232" offset="2630170">And, they don't conduct that review on this cross-case comparative basis that the Ninth Circuit and Harris have urged, rather just as this Court decided last year in Sollin.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.724" offset="2688162">It is an examination of broader factual questions, types of cases, categories of crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.914" offset="2724838">I think the essential point is that the Lynch test, which was adopted as to capital punishment in the Frierson and Jackson cases is precisely the same three-step test that this Court established last term in Sollin v. Helm.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.476" offset="2803101">So, returning back to Justice O'Connor's question, what does the California Court do, the California Court provides a death sentence to defendant with a very clear three-step test as to what proportionality constitutes, precisely the same three-step test that this Court has provided death sentence defendants nationwide.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="691.978" offset="2917099">That is correct, Your Honor, it is not a cross-case comparative analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.513" offset="2931310">It is... I prefer frankly not to use the term "proportionality review", because it implies some special kind of hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.619" offset="2959731">It is a review of the question of the issue of proportionality, no different, except for the substantive issue itself, no different than a review of the voluntariness of confessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.225" offset="3002154">If the defendant has a case, he raises the issue and the court addresses it.</text>
            <text syncTime="718.295" offset="3022425">So, that was offered, Your Honor, to Mr. Harris in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.199" offset="3041965">As the appeal was pending before the California Supreme Court, as the briefs were being written, the Frierson case expressly applied the eight-year old, at that time, Lynch test to capital punishment, applied to this growing issue of proportionality review, inviting, it would seem to me, Mr. Harris to raise the issue of proportionality if he was of the opinion that his sentence was in any way disproportionate.</text>

            <text syncTime="844.311" offset="3526484">--That is right, notwithstanding my repeated argument that Jurek stands for the proposition that no such proportionality review is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.715" offset="3560129">I don't think it is necessary, given the time given in the brief for the issue, it is not necessary to go over the Gregg, Proffitt, and Jurek cases here.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.325" offset="3618539">The point that I have that I think is clear is that this Court did not in those cases demand proportionality review as part of the death sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.734" offset="3668172">That is the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.418" offset="3674859">All this Court did in those cases is approve, once they had proportionality review as apart of its statutory system, approve one state, Florida, which the Supreme Court has said it would conduct a proportionality review exactly the same way California has and reading of the Florida cases shows that sometimes they examine proportionality, sometimes they don't examine proportionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.969" offset="3781125">They, like California, address the question when it is raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.754" offset="3796276">Of course, there is Texas which has no such provision at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.742" offset="3812159">I think it is important in looking at the constitutional Eighth Amendment question here to draw the strong distinction between cross-case analysis and what I would refer to as review of proportionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.601" offset="3875584">This Court's decisions, the Furman decision and the Gregg decision, have expressed a very strong concern about the issue of arbitrariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="941.373" offset="3914663">The procedures that were referred to in the Gregg series of cases whereby it would be ensured that a jury, a sentencing jury, or any sentencing authority would be given fully informed, guided discretion in their decision, was designed to ensure a freedom... a system designed to be free from arbitrariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.805" offset="4008391">That was the focus of those cases, a concern that the petitions be free of arbitrariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.959" offset="4029080">That is not all, however, that this Court has provided for that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="975.446" offset="4051022">In addition to requiring the states to establish a system, a statutory system designed to avoid arbitrariness, there is the separate issue of proportionality that this Court has discussed for almost a century since the Weems case and most recently in the context of the death penalty has discussed in the Coker versus Georgia case, Endman versus Florida, and last term I think most clearly coalesced in the Sollin v. Helm case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.799" offset="4168365">The Court has said that no matter what the statutory system is, no matter how well defined it is, there still must be a proportionality to the judgment, even if they are a result of a presumptively valid system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.892" offset="4224789">They must be proportional, and if, as is the case in the death sentence for rape in Coker and in the death sentence for a non-personally committed, non-intentional murder in Endman, if they are disproportionate, then that has to be a way to review that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.104" offset="4293648">California has no argument with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.056" offset="4305455">California has used that standard for over a decade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.924" offset="4316949">What California urges is that it must be the kind of review that this Court discussed in Helm for a couple of very good reasons.</text>

            <text syncTime="1095.356" offset="4530631">I think the most useful way to approach the issue is to begin with a look at what this Court was concerned about in Furman and Gregg as to the constitutionality of the death penalty and that is arbitrariness and I believe that all of the arguments having to do with the question of proportionality and whatever particular brand of that applies here are really addressed to the question of controlling arbitrariness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.691" offset="4635956">The Court in Gregg established procedures which states have followed to ensure against arbitrariness, but the idea of proportionality is essentially intended as a second line of defense in the individual case against the possibility of an arbitrary result being produced by one of the state systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.754" offset="4724250">Unless we are to have two very different constitutional motions of proportionality that this Court announced in the Helm case last term and some new one to be announced applicable to death penalty cases, then I think we have to rely on what this Court has said in Helm, which was based on the state work done earlier in both Coker and in Endman, which is precisely the same sort of proportionality that the State of California has offered its death sentence defendants, and, in fact, all defendants for well over a decade.</text>

            <text syncTime="1476.989" offset="6057122">If we are to look at all of the factors that go into a sentencing authority's determination to condemn a man, then necessarily, unavoidably, the Court doing that is going to wind up substituting its judgment for that of the sentencing authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1995.807" offset="8132394">First, I should like to explain why I disagree with Mr. Wellington's answer to Justice O'Connor's question and Justice Stevens' question as to what California law is and why I believe that California law may well offer all of the proportionality review that we are asking for in this case and more.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.006" offset="8217240">California law in short is not limited to Sollin v. Helm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.558" offset="8235421">Secondly, I would like to argue that this Court's decisions plainly imply, if they do not already squarely held, that federal Eighth Amendment review is also, in death cases, not limited to Sollin v. Helm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.086" offset="8309609">And, finally, I would like to clear up any question as to what Harris asked for in the state courts to demonstrate that he has asked in the state courts for exactly the kind of proportionality review that California law does, in fact, allow and that we urge the Eighth Amendment allows.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.000" offset="8385259">I will then ask that the judgment below for those reasons be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2086.417" offset="8494869">The important thing to keep in mind about California law is that it is in evolution, that none of us is very sure at the moment exactly what California law does provide or what the California Supreme Court does do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.243" offset="8550144">In Lynch, the California Supreme Court announced a decision which was quite like this Court's decision in Sollin v. Helm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.699" offset="8592045">However, as the California cases, which are collected in our brief in note 18 at pages 32 to 33 indicate, California has gone well beyond that.</text>

            <text syncTime="2188.968" offset="8905096">The Dillon case, the defendant was clearly within the first degree murder statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2192.087" offset="8917530">It was a killing in the course of a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.753" offset="8924218">Moreover, the California Supreme Court held that the defendant had killed intentionally which was why it reduced this punishment to second degree, which in California is intentional murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2204.144" offset="8965805">Now, we have an intentional killing, one, I might add, which was done by nine bullet wounds in the course of a robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.564" offset="8999450">And, the California Supreme Court, which could have held that that punishment was not excessive, indeed, which could have held under this Court's decision in Gregg, that the death penalty was not excessive for an intentional killing, went ahead and reduced under California law the sentence of life imprisonment, and, indeed, reduced the degree of offense from first degree murder to second degree murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.865" offset="9104671">Now, to come to Justice Stevens' question and a question Justice White has also been asking, what about cross-case review.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.971" offset="9133093">There is the beginning of that in Dillon.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.256" offset="9142288">Dillon finds that the death penalty was excessive... Excuse me, that the first degree murder conviction and a life sentence was excessive on the facts of the Dillon case largely because of individual characteristics of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.599" offset="9203623">But, the court adds, and I am now reading from 194 California Reporter, at page 420,</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.003" offset="9233194">"finally, the excessiveness of defendant's punishment is underscored by the petty chastisement handed out to the six other youths who participated with him in the same offenses. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.279" offset="9290350">Although this was a conspiracy to commit robbery and a murder in the course of it and all of the coparticipants were guilty of robbery and murder under California law, the Court says the one member of the gang who was an adult was allowed to plead no contest to charges of conspiracy to commit robbery and all of the other minors were simply made wards of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.728" offset="9384077">Says the court in short defendant received the heaviest penalty provided by law while those jointly responsible with him received the lightest, the proverbial slap on the wrist.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.304" offset="9438412">Now, of course, this is not cross-case comparison in the sense of some other murder case, but it is a beginning of comparing the death sentence with other sentences, those meted out to Dillon's accomplices in this offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2335.529" offset="9491284">Moreover, in the Dillon case, in a footnote, 26... Again, I am referring to 194 California Reporter at 413, Footnote 26, the court cites with approval California Court of Appeals cases, including the Keogh case and the Vargas case, which is cited in our brief in Footnote 18.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.846" offset="9600580">The Keogh case does exactly what Justice Stevens and Justice White have been asking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.750" offset="9624195">It engages in cross-case comparison.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.237" offset="9638196">Keogh involved a sentence of four consecutive sentences for forgery as a result of which the defendant ended up with a 64-year sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.062" offset="9693471">The Court of Appeals, in an opinion by Justice Jefferson, looked at the median term of imprisonment served by forgers in California, found that few of them went to jail at all and when they did it was for 22 to 24 months, and on that kind of a comparison proceeded to invalidate, again, Justice Rehnquist, under the California cruel or unusual punishment clause, the Lynch clause, the punishment imposed on Keogh.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.099" offset="9821576">Now, I think it is indisputable that California law goes well beyond Sollin v. Helm.</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.372" offset="9850729">It goes beyond, although it is in evolution and it is unclear exactly how far it has gone so far, it goes beyond anything that we need to ask for in order to get the relief that we have requested in this case which is to have the California Supreme Court compare other death sentences and life sentences in comparable cases with Harris.</text>

            <text syncTime="3348.399" offset="13542771">Recently this Court summed up in a very few words what is demanded by saying that what is demanded is that the states apply the death penalty with reasonable consistency or not at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.760" offset="13604211">Now, the kind of review which is required, we contend, by the Eighth Amendment is only so much appellate review as is required to produce reasonable consistency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3380.370" offset="13670667">What a court needs to do is to look at the facts of the case in front of it, to look at the judgments and the facts of comparable cases and to ask whether, in the class of case, including this one, the death penalty has been so infrequently and erratically imposed that the concerns of Furman are violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3411.908" offset="13796890">And, the state seems to concede that that is necessary in its reply brief.</text>

Harris has not shown and it cannot be shown that either an overwhelming majority or a significant minority of legislatures, courts, or juries in states with capital punishment have acted to repudiate death as a punishment for such crimes as Harris'.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.293" offset="14010363">There is no way in which Harris could show or in which a court could find that courts and juries in similar cases have repudiated the death penalty unless Harris is permitted to lay in front of a court, and we say the California Supreme Court, the facts of his case and the judgments rendered in comparable cases so that the court can ask the question, looking at the pool of cases like Harris', has the death penalty been so infrequently applied, so irregularly applied, that the considerations which brought about this Court's Furman decision apply to Harris' death sentence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3602.244" offset="14558203">As far as we are concerned nothing more is constitutionally required than what this Court did in similar judgments in Furman.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.786" offset="14600312">For example, Justice White's opinion in Furman said essentially I have seen a number of these cases come through.</text>
            <text syncTime="3619.539" offset="14627375">I am left with an abiding conviction, after looking at numbers of these cases, that uniformity and even-handedness are lacking, that some people are going to death while others exactly the same live.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.651" offset="14691845">All we said is that the federal Constitution requires a state appellate court of general jurisdiction to look at the cases passing through the tubes and make exactly that kind of judgment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3743.436" offset="15122970">As long as the court does a conscientious job of looking to see whether the death penalty in a kind of case like the one at bar is so erratic that the court can say this is not the regular and evenhanded imposition of a death penalty.</text>
