            <label>Mr. Harry A. Rissetto</label>
            <text syncTime="99.187" offset="543027">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves the application of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as it was amended to claims of employment discrimination on the basis of handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.587" offset="604571">I think it would be useful to briefly outline the essential facts that resulted in the petition for cert being granted and being petitioned in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.063" offset="646472">Mr. LeStrange was employed originally by the Erie Lackawanna Railroad in 1943 as an engine service employee.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.689" offset="676983">He progressed from fireman to engineer, and in 1972... I'm sorry, 1971, as a result of a non-job related injury, Mr. LeStrange suffered the loss of his left hand and part of his left forearm.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.438" offset="736019">He was subsequently disqualified from active employment on the Erie Lackawanna by the medical department of the Erie Lackawanna.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.234" offset="771128">Shortly afterwards, the Erie Lackawanna sought the protection of the bankruptcy laws, and in 1976 the properties, the rail properties of the Erie Lackawanna were conveyed to ConRail.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.470" offset="820134">In 1978, Mr. LeStrange was examined by a ConRail medical officer to determine whether he was qualified to be reinstated as a yard service engineer on ConRail, and he was rejected.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.631" offset="884708">A complaint was filed under the Rehabilitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.943" offset="901949">The district court granted ConRail's motion for summary judgment on that aspect of the complaint, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.323" offset="947507">The principal question in the case regards the scope of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.257" offset="979272">It is ConRail's position that Section 504 applies only when the primary objective of the federal assistance is to provide employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.325" offset="1019500">That interpretation is based primarily on the language of the statute, and it is... and then that interpretation has also been adopted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second, Fourth, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.856" offset="1097659">Section 504 provides that no otherwise qualified handicapped individual as defined in Section 7067 of this title shall solely by reason of his handicap be excluded from the participation in and be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.582" offset="1184594">Section 504 as originally enacted had no enforcement procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.985" offset="1206119">In 1978, the statute was amended by the addition of Section 505, which provided, and this is the critical language in the case, that the remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in Title 6 of the Civil Rights Act shall be available to any person aggrieved by any act or failure to act by any recipient of federal assistance or federal provider of such assistance under Section 794, which is Section 504 of this title.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.786" offset="1341329">Thus, the incorporation of the Title 6 remedies raises the principal issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.841" offset="1369541">In incorporating Title 6, what rights, remedies, and procedures were incorporated and made applicable to actions under Section 504?</text>
            <text syncTime="316.707" offset="1413009">It is ConRail's interpretation of the statute that the rights, remedies, and procedures contained in Title 6 include the limitations and particular provisions set out in Section 604 of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.357" offset="1471628">Section 604 of Title 6 provides that nothing contained in this title shall be construed to authorize action under this title by any department or agency with respect to any employment practice of any employer, employment agency, or labor organization except where a primary objective of the federal financial assistance is to provide the employment.</text>

            <text syncTime="366.320" offset="1611539">Our interpretation is based on the plain language of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.125" offset="1638707">There is very little legislative history on either side of the question, either with respect to the initial enactment of Section 503--</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry A. Rissetto</label>
            <text syncTime="382.321" offset="1675487">--There are 3,000 pages in the Rehabilitation Act, and the Rehabilitation Act itself is a lengthy statute dealing with a myriad of vocational rehabilitation programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.939" offset="1725956">Section 504 appears in the miscellaneous section, and there is scarcely a snippet of legislative history that focuses on it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="403.285" stopTime="405.927">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="403.285" offset="1759392">Do you have any explanation why it wasn't even mentioned?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harry_a_rissetto" startTime="405.927" stopTime="872.883">
            <label>Mr. Harry A. Rissetto</label>
            <text syncTime="405.927" offset="1769946">The only explanation that I can offer, and it would be one by hypothesis rather than by reference to the legislative history, is that Congress understood what they meant in Title 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.600" offset="1836610">They understood the coverage of Title 6, and they were simply incorporating Title 6 into Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.473" offset="1868166">Both in the initial passage of Section 504, there is almost an identical similarity in the language between Section 504 and Section 601 of Title 6, and in addition, when they amended the statute in 1978 and incorporated the rights, remedies, and procedures of Title 6 to enforce Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.069" offset="1954475">We believe that the legislative history of Section 601 itself, without even looking at Section 604 of the Act, supports an inference that Congress did not intend to regulate federal programs with respect to employment practices, except where the federal program had as its primary objective employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.476" offset="2068160">Whatever ambiguity may have existed in the language of Section 601 as it was originally proposed was rectified when Congress passed Section 604 of the Act, which clearly prohibited or clearly limited the use of Section 601 for employment discrimination, and with respect to Section 604 and Section 601, there is some legislative history, and the legislative history supports a limiting interpretation of Section 601 and 604.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.311" offset="2215490">Now, in the North Haven case, dealing with the third statute, that has language similar to Section 504 and Section 601, this Court considered whether or not Title 9 of the Education Act amendments apply broadly to all programs receiving federal assistance with respect to employment discrimination on the basis of handicap, or conversely, whether it applied narrowly only when the primary objective of the program for assistance was to provide employment, and they opted for the latter interpretation of the statute, and the North Haven decision was important, if not instrumental in the decision of the court of appeals in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.033" offset="2406393">We believe that Title 9 and the North Haven decision is inapposite for several reasons, the first of which is that Title 9 has its own enforcement procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.851" offset="2453623">It did not incorporate Title 6.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.364" offset="2467729">The enforcement procedures set out in Title 9 do not include an analogue to Section 604.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.856" offset="2493642">Secondly, during the legislative consideration of Title 9 amendments, a provision identical or similar, significantly identical to Section 604 was offered and proposed in Congress and was rejected by Congress during the conference on the legislation, so thus the court in North Haven looked to the rejection of Section 604 as an indication of a legislative intent to construe the Title 9 more broadly than Title 6 had been construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.251" offset="2647242">And finally, there was positive legislative history identified in the Court's opinion in North Haven evidencing an intention to construe that statute more broadly than Title 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.508" offset="2692277">In contrast, with respect to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, Title 6 does not... is specifically incorporated in Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.510" offset="2756225">There is no evidence that Congress intended or attempted to exclude Section 604 from the rights, remedies, and procedures of Title 6 that were incorporated into Section 504 as an enforcement mechanism, and there is no legislative history that suggests that Section 604 was not intended to be applied to actions under Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.168" offset="2866880">We believe that Section 504 was intended to focus on the intended beneficiaries of the federal assistance, and in the context of allegations of work place discrimination, the intended beneficiaries of federal assistance exist only when the primary objective of the federal assistance is to provide employment, and this is even more so the case under Section 504 than under Title 6 and Title 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.542" offset="3024346">The primary objectives of Title 6 and Title 9 are to require the employer to present from considering an applicant or an employee's race, sex, national origin, or color in making employment-related decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.754" offset="3093205">If an employer acts on the basis of an employee's or an applicant's race or sex, the employer should know that he is either on shaky ground or he may be violating the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.965" offset="3150047">On the other hand, with respect to handicapped discrimination, allegations of handicapped discrimination, when an employer considers an application or a personnel action relating to a handicapped employee, he is almost always forced, or she is almost always forced to focus on the handicap, the nature of the handicap, because the statute itself requires the protections of the Act to handicapped persons who are otherwise qualified for employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.478" offset="3300095">So, in practice, when an employer considers, as in the case of Mr. LeStrange, whether Mr. LeStrange is qualified to be a yard service engineer on ConRail, he is not being asked to consider whether Mr. LeStrange is qualified other than the fact that he is missing a portion of his left arm.</text>
            <text syncTime="814.435" offset="3403957">Rather, he is being asked to consider whether that handicap itself disqualifies Mr. LeStrange from employment on ConRail.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.394" offset="3459755">And I believe that that distinction between the Acts buttresses an... a narrowing interpretation of Section 504 that would direct the statute to the program that is being considered, and in the context of employment discrimination, the program has to be related to employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="853.160" offset="3558916">Otherwise, Section 504 assumes a range of remedial legislation, and it is our position that Congress did not intend to enact remedial legislation when it passed Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.021" offset="3626312">If one examines the 1978--</text>

            <text syncTime="887.552" offset="3696424">I think Title 7 is a model of remedial legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="891.705" offset="3713038">I would distinguish remedial legislation from legislation where the principal purpose of the statute is to obtain compliance.</text>

            <text syncTime="958.019" offset="3978338">They operate that a recipient of federal assistance can come into compliance with the objectives of the Act by agreeing to follow the requirements of Section 504.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="1085.271" offset="4487308">Well, we believe that in the Cannon case, that they recognized the private cause of action, and as a result of this Court's recent decision in the Guardians case under Title 6, we have conceded in our reply brief that there is a private cause of action under Title 6... under Title 6 and under Section 504, in the context of a handicap discrimination complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.739" offset="4589185">However, we believe that the purposes of the private cause of action that are created should be consistent with the funding purpose of the statute, and should be designed to bring the employer into compliance, and that the purposes of the statute and the legislative intent can be achieved without awarding compensatory damages and retrospective relief to a person who is aggrieved under the terms of the statute, and that really is the third argument, and the one that must necessarily be reached by the Court in this case, because if the complainant is not entitled to compensatory damages or monetary relief under this Act, then the case is moot, because there is no basis for injunctive relief under the... because Mr. LeStrange has passed away.</text>
            <text syncTime="1169.457" offset="4824078">So, we believe that a question that the Court should consider is the propriety of monetary damages, and that essentially is a question of legislative intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1268.374" offset="5219677">If the Court simply remands the case back to the district court, then we have to start from scratch again on entitlement to damages under Section... or monetary relief under Section 504, and the prospect of wending our way through again on that issue we think presents considerations of judicial administration that would prey on the Court to answer the question in the context of this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1338.949" offset="5502008">In the normal case, federal assistance is received to build a building, to perform, to subsidize in the system some kind of specific program, be it a public works project or otherwise.</text>

            <text syncTime="1787.084" offset="7294530">There are three statements that can be made regarding the issues presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.018" offset="7318250">First, Section 504 prohibits employment discrimination in all federally assisted programs, regardless of the purpose of the funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.373" offset="7359732">Secondly, the discrimination against Mr. LeStrange was in a program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.031" offset="7394318">And third, monetary relief is available in a private right of action under Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.033" offset="7418351">I will first address the major issue in the case, which incidentally is the only issue which was addressed by the court below, and that is, Section 504 prohibits employment discrimination in all federally assisted programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1831.383" offset="7471745">First we must look at the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as a whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.916" offset="7493897">As a whole, it had a broad-based application to employment discrimination, or to... I'm sorry, to vocational rehabilitation and creating employment opportunities for the handicapped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.654" offset="7540813">In dealing specifically now with Section 504, and also applying the test as set forth by this Court in North Haven, we first look to the express language of Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.022" offset="7590341">This language of Section 504 does not support a narrow or limited reading of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1869.157" offset="7622837">Rather, it specifically refers to any program or activity, not some programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.570" offset="7652512">Thus, the language of the statute, 504 itself, seems to indicate a broad employment coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1882.885" offset="7677799">Next, we will look at the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.907" offset="7689815">This history... we will have to go back now from 1972 through 1974 first, and this is in response somewhat to a question asked by Justice Marhsall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.614" offset="7728686">There is a great deal of legislative history regarding this Act, both prior to and after the amendments, but if we look to the legislative history from 1972 through 1974, it shows the intent of Congress to prohibit employment discrimination in all federally assisted programs, regardless of the purpose of the funding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1930.476" offset="7868179">These are set forth at length under Pages 65 through 72 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.770" offset="7889286">Also, and this is kind of a bit of a convoluted reference, but it was in response to Justice O'Connor's parallel remark, in 1972, Congress was dealing with Title 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.820" offset="7945502">Congress specifically rejected with Title 9 a Title 6 type of limitation in Section 1004.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.586" offset="7980610">That is mentioned, I believe, in the North Haven decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.327" offset="7991582">Just four months later, Congress considered a parallel, or a statute which was modeled after Section 901, and they did not even consider a similar limitation for Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.155" offset="8038811">In 1974, Congress clarified the scope of Section 504 by redefining the term "handicapped individual".</text>
            <text syncTime="1982.781" offset="8077368">Actually, in 1974, Congress set it up so that Section 504 applied not only to employment discrimination, but also to all other types of discrimination as well, and if I may digress here for a moment, there was some discussion during Mr. Rissetto's argument that this is not a remedial statute, but in 1974, when the amendments were passed, there is clear legislative history which is indicated in our brief that says that it was contemplated by Congress that there was to be a judicial remedy through private action as part of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.834" offset="8221564">Thus, if we look at both the express language and the legislative history of Section 504 before its amendment, this supports broad employment coverage within the meaning of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.474" offset="8276108">Now, let's turn for a moment to the 1978 amendments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.226" offset="8295125">These amendments did not limit the scope of Section 504, which, according to its legislative history, was broad to begin with.</text>

            <text syncTime="2174.437" offset="8844010">Section 604 is neither a right, remedy, or procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="2179.209" offset="8863027">Also, we should note that Section 505(a)(2) refers to any recipient of federal assistance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2453.118" offset="9958707">So, our position is that the current regulations dealing with ConRail... these would be the Department of Transportation regulations... do not include any type of 604 limitation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2739.084" offset="11102557">Also, the legislative history, if we look at that under Section 504 as amended, clearly shows no intent to limit the monetary relief which may be available.</text>

            <text syncTime="2849.997" offset="11546220">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I have but a few minutes, and I believe they can best be utilized by underscoring some of the points made by Mr. Lenahan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.785" offset="11593345">The issue here is one of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.298" offset="11607451">Section 504 as enacted in 1973 prescribes discrimination on account of handicapped in any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.237" offset="11659174">There is, as I understand it, no issue in this case whether the provision covers employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2885.610" offset="11688640">I suspect after North Haven there really could not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2889.664" offset="11704836">The issue instead is how much employment activity is covered by Section 504.</text>
            <text syncTime="2896.149" offset="11730854">The United States' position is that the 1973 Congress intended Section 504 to be every bit as broad in its employment coverage as this Court found Title 9 to be in North Haven.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.910" offset="11797832">The entire structure and focus of the Rehabilitation Act is aimed at enhancing employment opportunities for physically and mentally handicapped individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.467" offset="11848091">Indeed, the very word "handicapped" was defined in the statute in terms of employability, and specific provisions were included in the Act to encourage employment of the handicapped by the federal government and by those contracting with the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.671" offset="11928862">There is nothing in the language or the history of Section 504 to suggest that Congress had more modest ambitions for federally assisted programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.269" offset="11983301">To the contrary, the 93rd Congress in 1973 proscribed employment discrimination on account of handicap in Section 504 as comprehensively and indeed in virtually the same terms as did the 92nd Congress in 1972, only a year earlier, with respect to Title 9 insofar as it covered employment discrimination on account of sex in educational programs.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harry A. Rissetto</label>
            <text syncTime="3627.971" offset="14658135">It was recently mentioned that the HEW regulations were in existence in 1978, and constitute enactment history.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.517" offset="14712261">The critical reference to the HEW regulations in the legislative history of the 1978 amendments appear on Page A16 of our petition for cert, and are quoted as part of the court of appeals decision, and it is a very small paragraph, and I would like to ask the Court if I could read it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.814" offset="14801495">"It is the Committee's understanding that the regulations promulgated by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare with respect to the procedures, remedies, and rights under Section 504 conform with those promulgated under Title 6. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3680.013" offset="14866279">"Thus this amendment codifies existing practice as a specific statutory requirement. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.157" offset="14890834">Now, that quoted portion could mean either one or two things, that in fact there is no antagonism between Title 6 and the HEW regulations, and I believe there is... the evidence or the legislative history of Title 6 and its applicability to employment is very clear, or alternatively that the regulations are not in conformity with the language of Title 6, and therefore the report and the representation made to Congress in the legislative history regarding the HEW regulations are erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.815" offset="15065437">We believe that the enactment legislative history either supports ConRail's position that Title 6 does apply to Section 504 or that the references to the HEW regulations that appear in the legislative history are misleading and should not be given weight by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.903" offset="15173792">The second point I would like to make is one that at the conclusion of respondent's argument, he argued that if respondent's interpretation of Section 504 is not adopted, ConRail would be able to discriminate with impunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.770" offset="15269296">I think there are two responses to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.982" offset="15282148">The first is that when Title 6 was originally passed, it was passed and had a very narrow scope as it applied to employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.418" offset="15327915">I think that the legislative history establishes that, both through the legislative history relating to 601 and 604.</text>
            <text syncTime="3803.683" offset="15360934">That narrow scope left a group of people, including public employees and educational employees, without a remedy for employment discrimination, because they were not covered by Title 7 in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="3817.622" offset="15416731">They were not brought into Title 7 until the 1972 amendments were passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3821.906" offset="15433868">So, I don't think it is bizarre, I don't think it's amazing or irrational for Congress to pass a legislation with a particular purpose, with a narrow application in one of its phases, and thereby leave a group of people without a remedy for discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.779" offset="15509309">It has been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.158" offset="15514847">I think just as a last note, as we indicated in our reply briefs, there is legislation in more than 40 states now, including every state in which ConRail does business in except Delaware, prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of handicap.</text>
            <text syncTime="3861.293" offset="15591438">These state statutes ordinarily provide remedies which are ordinarily similar to those provided under Section 7, although there has been some experimentation in some of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.059" offset="15642429">We believe that plaintiffs who allege that they are not covered by Section 504 do have a remedy, and that ConRail does have a legally enforceable obligation not to engage in discrimination on the basis of handicap as well as, obviously, an ethical and moral obligation not to do so.</text>
