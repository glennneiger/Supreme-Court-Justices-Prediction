            <text syncTime="1217.611" offset="5016852">It started in 1973 and has gone through 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.896" offset="5030018">The effect of the orders below are to curtail the publication of the story in midstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.448" offset="5048199">The Times has been muzzled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.317" offset="5055722">If it publishes anything more now about Rhinehart, it runs the risk that he will hail it into court on a contempt citation and make it prove independent sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1236.255" offset="5091458">This is the very nature of censorship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.707" offset="5101280">Consequently, there have not been further articles because the long arm of the court may fall down on the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.111" offset="5126880">So I think that both as a litigant and as a newspaper, it has an interest in advancing these considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.248" offset="5151435">Evidence was submitted to the lower courts that the Respondents have made a practice of suing former members and the media whenever they are criticized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.538" offset="5188529">They have used litigation very effectively, and there is information in the record that they brought over 20 suits to silence the kind of criticism they have been receiving, the kind of public scrutiny they have been receiving.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.579" offset="5228757">This is an organization which appeals to the public for funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.697" offset="5245162">Rhinehart himself goes out of his way to bill himself as one of the most significant gurus on this planet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.053" offset="5274628">He has conducted nationwide exhibitions of his powers, his powers as a medium, his powers to communicate with the dead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.540" offset="5304617">He claims that he has the power to bestow special powers on colored stones in a way, and then members are allowed to contribute certain sums of money, several thousands of dollars in many cases, to acquire these stones that carry special powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.800" offset="5357593">The Times has been covering these articles, trying to bring this information to the public, and the effect of the order below is to stop that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.537" offset="5384551">I have got the articles, and I was going to read the titles, but my time is getting short, but I would summarize the articles by saying that they do draw into question the bona fides of the Aquarian Foundation, the question of whether or not Rhinehart has the powers he claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.011" offset="5438468">They question whether or not he is a charlatan, whether or not people are being victimized, whether or not this is a con game.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.748" offset="5461456">And as as result of that, he brought this suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.784" offset="5473577">Now, in the trial court he obtained this order restraining publication, and it says in advance, you may not publish what you learn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.573" offset="5504715">And the test used by the trial court was simply this: parties may be chilled from coming to court if they know that what they say in discovery might be published.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.846" offset="5541809">And I would contrast that with your decision in Globe Newspapers in which the state argued that minor victims might he chilled from coming forward because they might be chilled, and that was deemed an insufficient reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.886" offset="5581933">The court speculated about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.769" offset="5589456">It did not make the kind of findings you required in the Press Enterprise decision on the exclusion of the press from voir dire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.290" offset="5611608">There are virtually no findings in the trial court and in the State Supreme Court to justify this restraint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.461" offset="5636267">The State Supreme Court approached it on a prior restraint analysis under your decision in Nebraska Press and then concluded that the interest of the judiciary in the integrity of its discovery process is sufficient to overcome the strong presumption against prior restraints enunciated in cases since Near, New York Times, Nebraska Press and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.025" offset="5718501">And the Supreme Court said if any of the harms mentioned in the rule... and that is Rule 26, which is the same as the federal rule... they said if any of the harms mentioned in Rule 26 can be avoided, and the major concern... and since the major concern is the facilitation and protection of the discovery process and the parties' privacy rights, then the order can issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.354" offset="5803869">And in the ordinary case, this balancing does not require or condone publicity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1897.179" offset="7735154">It does apply to some information that is a matter of... that was filed in a court file, and let me explain how that happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.034" offset="7770576">A deposition of Reverend Rhinehart was taken by the Seattle Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.669" offset="7793146">In that deposition questions were asked about financial matters relating to the foundation and to Reverend Rhinehart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.692" offset="7825224">There was in that deposition a promise that this information, financial information, would not be disclosed, it would not be used for any purpose other than for the lawsuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.601" offset="7888858">As a result of that promise, the income tax returns of Reverend Rhinehart were turned over to the Seattle Times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.457" offset="7928251">Reverend Rhinehart at that time was represented by a different counsel who thought he had to also file them, and he did file them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.514" offset="7972450">Once it was discovered that the income tax returns were filed by this counsel, we moved to have those income tax returns removed from the public record so that the policy and the theory behind the production of those income tax returns, namely, that they are to be used only for the purposes of this lawsuit, would be implemented.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.355" offset="8119885">Thereafter, the Seattle Times sent out a substantial number of interrogatories and requests for production.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.794" offset="8153636">We then resisted the disclosure of some of the information that they requested, and we asked if that information was compelled to be disclosed, that a protective order be entered on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.803" offset="8213613">The trial court entered a protective order after directing us to provide this information in answer to the interrogatories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.993" offset="8246422">Now, what kind of information does this protective order apply to?</text>
            <text syncTime="2029.461" offset="8264290">It applies to a very limited class of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.413" offset="8276098">It applies only to the names of the members and donors to the Aquarian Foundation and its spiritual leaders, and financial information relating to the foundation and its spiritual leaders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.256" offset="8339418">The order... and I think this is critical... does not gag the Seattle Times in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.492" offset="8368362">The Seattle Times is free to publish anything it cares to publish as long as it has a source that is independent of court-compelled discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.217" offset="8407337">So all we are dealing with is whether the court can, when it orders a party to reveal or disclose information, make that a limited disclosure of information, and that's exactly what the trial court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.227" offset="8471285">The Aquarian Foundation, Reverend Rhinehart, other plaintiffs, you are required to provide this information, but your disclosure will be limited, limited to the purpose of this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.134" offset="8518932">And that's what we're dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.903" offset="8526037">This order also applies only to parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.938" offset="8546204">This order does not purport to gag any member of the press or the public about anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.044" offset="8574625">It simply says that as a party to this process, you used your rank as a party to get access to this information; you must limit your use to the purpose for... that you used to obtain it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.636" offset="8632930">Now, that's all we're talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.553" offset="8640662">There are no cases of this Court which relate to that kind of a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.307" offset="8663650">The Landmark case in which a newspaper acquired information about a judicial discipline proceeding involved a nonparty to that judicial discipline proceeding, and the Court held that that party could not be restrained from publishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.086" offset="8726762">The Court went to great lengths to note that it was not deciding that a party to the proceeding could not be compelled to maintain the secrecy of the proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2156.625" offset="8772947">What we have here in this particular case is an order which applies to normally private information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.749" offset="8813384">Indeed, the information to which this order applies is ordinarily constitutionally protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.355" offset="8847866">This Court has held in NAACP v. Alabama, in Brown v. Socialist Workers Party, in Detroit Edison v. NLRB, and in Shelton v. Tucker that certain private kinds of information about members and donors of minority faiths or minority associations is entitled to constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2202.505" offset="8956431">The party is not required to disclose it because to do so would subject the party to reprisal or oppression.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.711" offset="8997286">And that is what we are dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.496" offset="9004391">We have a minority faith who wishes to protect the names of its donors and of its members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.602" offset="9040858">They have rights of free exercise of religion, rights of free association, rights of privacy that are guaranteed by the Constitution just as is freedom of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="2236.327" offset="9091745">And these rights need to be protected by the courts to the same extent as do the press rights, and the trial court held that the way to do that was to enter a protective order.</text>

            <text syncTime="2761.946" offset="11194184">Yes, that the access to the court was a fundamental concern of theirs, and essentially what they said is the only alternative the Seattle Times has really presented that is realistic is denial of discovery altogether, and obviously if you deny discovery, they don't have anything to publish, so they don't have any reason to have a protective order, and we would all be happy and could go home, because that's what we'd like, too, is that they not be able to give this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2787.830" offset="11297734">But the court said that is not a realistic alternative because of the importance of the discovery process in the just resolution of disputes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.619" offset="11332947">Given that, the State Supreme Court said that whatever limited interest there may be in the right to publish this material obtained through court-compelled disclosure is far outweighed by the need of the state to have a system to resolve disputes, and it is very easy when we read the briefs, particularly of the petitioner here, to forget the central fact, and that is that we are in that court right now and we have been here in this court and other courts trying to vindicate rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2856.808" offset="11573691">I think that the question of whether or not we are going to constitutionalize pretrial discovery if this Court adopts the balancing test we are advocating, and if it requires lower courts to enter findings and give justifications for these restraints on speech, is a question that was really decided by the framers of our Constitution and the drafters of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.089" offset="11666791">The First Amendment has been expanded by this Court already to in essence constitutionalize or make federal questions out of courtroom closure cases, out of the ability of the press to publish information that the judicial system is trying to keep secret, such as the judicial probe in the Landmark case, the names of minor victims in the Globe case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.503" offset="11756444">The Court has constitutionalized the question of whether or not the fair trial interests of the press... excuse me, the fair trial interests of a defendant, in Globe... in Nebraska Press, justify protective orders against the press like the one that was entered there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.947" offset="11818197">In Smith v. Daily Mail this Court held that a newspaper could not be punished for violating a state statute and publishing the names of minor offenders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.654" offset="11857067">There are a whole range of cases in which these issues have come up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.439" offset="11868143">And yes, we do argue that whenever government, by whatever form, attempts to suppress speech, particularly in advance of that speech, then the First Amendment is called into question, federal questions are present, and we believe that in most cases orders that suppress speech in advance cannot pass muster under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.757" offset="11981410">Mr. Chief Justice Hughes started us down this line in Near v. Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.243" offset="11999382">The exceptions there to prior restraints were basically obscenity, fighting words and national security cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2969.064" offset="12022684">After the Pentagon Papers case it appears that there is not a lot left of the national security exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.301" offset="12047657">When one reads this Court's opinion dealing with the public administration of justice, the right of the public to know how its courts are administered, how justice is administered and the protections it has afforded those who disseminate information about the administration of justice, then we submit that one can only conclude that there are significant First Amendment interests at stake here, and they need to be balanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.334" offset="12147758">We are not arguing for an absolute test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.202" offset="12155281">We are arguing for a balancing test that gives First Amendment considerations a place on the scale.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.872" offset="12181926">The lower court didn't do that, and basically said protective orders are per se constitutional so long as they avoid embarrassment and the other things listed in Rule 26.</text>
