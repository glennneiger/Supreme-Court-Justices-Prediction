            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="139912">We will hear arguments first this morning in Dixson against the United States and the consolidated case.</text>

            <text syncTime="12.429" offset="189545">Mr. Chief Justice Burger, and may it please the Court, the issue before the Court is whether petitioners as employees of a community-based, non-profit corporation, United Neighborhoods, Incorporated, UNI, constituted public officials according to the bribery statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.785" offset="287034">Since petitioners in their employment with United Neighborhood, Incorporated, were not federal employees, the only provision under which they could be subject to the bribery statute would be as</text>
            <text syncTime="53.556" offset="354116">"persons acting for or on behalf of the United States or any department, agency, or branch of government thereof, in any official function, under or by the authority of any department or agency or branch of the government. "</text>
            <text syncTime="77.461" offset="449724">The legislative history establishes, however, that petitioners cannot be subject to the bribery statute under this provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.509" offset="489848">First, as employees of United Neighborhoods, Incorporated, they were not officers or persons acting on behalf of a corporation controlled by a department, agency, or branch of the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.110" offset="560274">Second, petitioners did not have contracts with a department, agency, or branch of the federal government, and therefore could not serve as agents in performing the terms.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="120.260" offset="620879">Did their agency, the local agency have a contract with the United States government?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="donald_v_morano" startTime="127.484" stopTime="414.211">
            <label>Mr. Donald V. Morano</label>
            <text syncTime="127.484" offset="649822">The contract was between the city of Peoria and the United States government.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.969" offset="683781">The contract was a community block grant, which was issued in 1978 to the city of Peoria, and petitioners were employees of a subgrantee, this non-profit corporation, United Neighborhoods, Incorporated.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.316" offset="777091">Third and last, petitioners were not federal inspectors licensed or authorized by some department, agency, or branch of the federal government to certify or enforce standards established by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.599" offset="858279">In looking at the legislative history of the bribery statute, in 1962, the last time the bribery statute was revised, Congress said that it was not making any substantive changes in the statute in regard to classes of persons subject to it, but merely was consolidating under one statute what had heretofore been 13 different statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.590" offset="990250">But Congress also declared that it was continuing to give the same broad interpretation of public official and public act as found in case law.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.498" offset="1049809">Congress, however, had been prodded by the Court in this Court's 1920 decision, United States versus Strang, to make the bribery statute applicable in piecemeal fashion to employees of government owned and controlled corporations, such as, for instance, the Homeowners Loan Corporation and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.618" offset="1162345">And then, in the year 1948, Congress revised the statute and inserted</text>
            <text syncTime="264.985" offset="1199752">"or any department or agency thereof. "</text>
            <text syncTime="268.297" offset="1213022">to embrace offices or persons acting on behalf of any independent agencies or government owned or controlled corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.243" offset="1256803">I think two good examples of government owned or controlled corporations would be the Federal Reserve Banks which are depositories for currencies held in the United States Treasury, and also fiscal and monetary agents of the United States, and another example would be the European Exchange System, which served as an instrumentality of the United States government and the Department of the Army in operating exchanges at European military posts.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.848" offset="1403298">Thus, what we can infer from these examples is that a necessary condition of such a government controlled corporation is that a department, agency, or branch of the federal government exercise an ongoing control, supervision, and direction of the operation of the corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.613" offset="1494309">There is a symbiotic relationship between the corporation which is controlled and the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.729" offset="1530776">One of the definitions given in Webster's Third International Dictionary of the noun "control", I think, specifies rather aptly the kind of control which I am talking about:</text>
            <text syncTime="361.146" offset="1584483">"Application of policies and procedures for directing, regulating, and coordinating production, administration, and other business activities in a way to achieve the objectives of the enterprise. "</text>
            <text syncTime="377.847" offset="1651252">Accordingly, United Neighborhoods, Incorporated, was not a corporation controlled by the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.982" offset="1679778">Indeed, the program manager of the Department of Housing and Urban Development for western Illinois in charge of the dispersal of the community development block grants to the city of Peoria during the period of the indictment testified that he neither knew or was required to know the existence of United Neighborhoods, Incorporated, nor, for that matter, any other subgrantee.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.499" offset="1837871">What I have argued, Justice Rehnquist, is that in effect there really are three rubrics under which someone could be deemed to act for and on behalf of the United States in terms of legislative history and case law which was given approbation by the Congress in its 1962 statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.767" offset="1958975">And the three rubrics are that you have an officer or employee of a government controlled corporation, or--</text>

            <text syncTime="499.307" offset="2137130">The statute is in the disjunctive, and you are right, in the latter part it says,</text>

            <text syncTime="514.717" offset="2198779">which suggests to me that that phrase must mean something over and above</text>

I can't think offhand of an example in which a person would be acting on behalf of the government unless they were some department, agency, or branch of the government involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.151" offset="2352483">I mean, it is--</text>

            <text syncTime="557.556" offset="2370038">They are covered by a separate statute, but that is an example, is it not, of someone acting for and on behalf of the government?</text>
            <text syncTime="564.719" offset="2398772">Are there other examples like the grain inspectors where some state or local agency or employee is designated by law to be an agent of the federal government?</text>

            <text syncTime="578.029" offset="2451958">--But I think that the grain inspector, wouldn't the grain inspector be acting for the Agriculture Department?</text>
            <text syncTime="584.434" offset="2477558">I think the grain inspector is authorized or licensed by the Agriculture Department.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.166" offset="2504516">Anyway, I would concede that it could be understood in the disjunctive, certainly, that it could be acting on the behalf of the United States or any department, agency, or branch of the government, but still, the three rubrics would be covered by that, whether you understood it as in the disjunctive or merely suplisage.</text>

            <text syncTime="806.827" offset="3367184">Granted the city of Peoria was required to submit annual reports to HUD, and the Secretary of HUD had the right to audit such community block grants and to adjust, reduce, or withdraw such funds if the city did not substantially comply with the terms of the application of the requirements of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.415" offset="3473554">But according to the Act, once the city of Peoria had received this community block grant, the entire administration of the grant was left to it, and HUD had absolutely no control over or right to interfere with its administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.876" offset="3543354">So therefore what is decisive is that the federal government had relinquished all control over the operation and administration of these community block grants once it had dispersed them to the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.708" offset="3614720">A fortiori, the city of Peoria in the five contracts it entered into in the year 1978 with UNI gave to UNI full control over the administration of this one... of these more than $1 million it had received in community block grants to rehabilitate an area of the city in which UNI had been carrying on its activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.687" offset="3726629">It retained only the right to terminate the agreements, and to seek other relief if UNI failed to comply with the municipal code, the city fair employment practices, and the terms of the contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.977" offset="3783785">Consequently, UNI was twice removed from being a corporation controlled by the United States government or by any department, agency, or branch of the government thereof.</text>
            <text syncTime="927.856" offset="3851285">In all but two cases in which persons who were not federal employees or employees of a government owned or controlled corporation were still adjudged public officials under the statute, either they had a contractual relationship with some... with the United States and, I would say, with some department, agency, or branch of the federal government, in which they served as federal agents, or they served as federal inspectors.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.303" offset="4009065">The only exceptions are the decisions of the Seventh Circuit in the instant case and in United States versus Mosley.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.779" offset="4050965">Petitioners in their employment with United Neighborhoods, Incorporated, had no contract with any department, agency, or branch of the federal government or the United States of America, nor were they agents of the federal government inasmuch as they had no direct dealings with the city of Peoria, let alone with the federal government.</text>

            <text syncTime="1728.614" offset="7054315">And this is not, it seems to me, what is the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1734.068" offset="7076154">I think that the government in its brief says that it is hard to imagine how Congress could have expressed more vividly its intention to cover persons administering federal programs, and I think in the very posing of the question it answers itself, for if Congress had intended that there be federal jurisdiction under the bribery statute for all cases of alleged fraud by persons administering federally funded programs, all it would have had to have done would have been to have drafted a statute stating just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.248" offset="7256816">But it didn't do such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.949" offset="7267683">It seems that the principle of lenity and the principle of federalism adds strength to this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.460" offset="7333721">The principle of lenity that in a criminal statute, if there is any ambiguity whatsoever, if there is genuine ambiguity... I shouldn't say any ambiguity whatsoever... but if there is a genuine ambiguity, the narrower construction is mandated, and it seems to me that the most one can say is that there is some doubt about Congressional intent about the language.</text>

            <text syncTime="1837.204" offset="7488679">In addition, since we have here not merely a criminal statute but a federal criminal statute, we also have problems of comity and federalism, that the area of criminal law is generally, absent a national or constitutional issue, left to the jurisdiction of the states.</text>

            <text syncTime="1914.615" offset="7798283">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the United States has just a few brief points to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.771" offset="7826913">The statutory construction question presented by this case is indeed readily resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.734" offset="7846766">The plain language of 18 USC Section 201 as well as its legislative history and the broad public policies underlying the federal bribery statute clearly demonstrate the petitioners are public officials within the meaning of the federal bribery statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.714" offset="7910714">At the outset a few facts, I believe, are necessary to put this question in its proper perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.487" offset="7933806">Petitioners were the executive director and housing rehabilitation coordinator of United Neighborhoods, Incorporated, a public or a non-profit public corporation that was designed to perform various functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.359" offset="7993261">One of these was the distribution of federal housing funds obtained from the federal government through the city of Peoria under the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.905" offset="8035474">As detailed in our brief, United Neighborhoods' use of these funds and petitioners' administration of these funds was subject to a whole host of federal substantive and procedural regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.131" offset="8088346">The federal government designed the program, set forth what activities UNI could undertake, set forth how the funds were to be managed and administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.488" offset="8125858">Indeed, although the petitioners say the federal government relinquished control over these funds, the legislative reports on the '72... on the '74 legislation state unequivocally that Congress provided extensive executive oversight</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.919" offset="8179566">"to ensure that federal funds are being used efficiently to achieve national objectives. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.481" offset="8205793">Therefore, this was not a mere local project, but rather, as UNI itself stated in its application for federal housing funds, it proposed to undertake</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.640" offset="8250410">"a joint effort with the city of Peoria to achieve the common goals as set forth in the Housing and Community Development Act. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2034.303" offset="8277055">Mr. Wilkins, can you give other examples of federal grant programs that you believe should be treated like the community development program for purposes of this statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.314" offset="8333166">It is somewhat of a concern to think that any potential recipient of federal money might be subject to the statute.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard G. Wilkins</label>
            <text syncTime="2059.261" offset="8376947">Certainly, it is a subject of some concern, but I think the plain terms of the statute handle that concern, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.145" offset="8408399">The statute applies only to a person acting for or on behalf of the United States in an official function, so it isn't just anyone who receives some sort of federal fund or some sort of federal subsidy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.812" offset="8455105">It is someone who performs an official function on behalf of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.246" offset="8472869">For example, the Seventh Circuit case noted by petitioners in Mosley, there the defendant was charged with administering the Comprehensive Education and Training Act, CETA funds, and he had the control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.975" offset="8535772">He could determine who would receive the benefit of those federal funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.160" offset="8556461">In this case, the power to determine who receives a federal housing rehabilitation contract is surely an important official function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.704" offset="8594704">This isn't a case where just anyone who receives funds falls within the reach of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2119.468" offset="8617692">Certainly in the Fortune versus Harris case, where we have to deal with the Freedom of Information Act question, the Court took a different approach and said that grants of federal funds generally don't create a partnership or joint venture with the recipient, and they don't convert the acts of the recipient from private acts to governmental acts, and so forth, and took a different approach.</text>

            <text syncTime="2156.965" offset="8767739">I think when you understand or when you consider that the underlying goal of federal bribery law is to protect the public from the evils of corruption in public service, the statute must be broad enough, must be construed broadly enough to deal with that concern, and the legislative history of this statute, as I hope to detail in a few moments--</text>

            <text syncTime="2196.829" offset="8927190">In fact, the case involving the grain inspectors cited in our brief, the Kirby case, does not involve the statute that specifically makes grain inspectors public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2206.086" offset="8964180">There are two statutes that govern grain inspectors, the Warehousemen's Act and the Grain Inspectors' Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.000" offset="8987899">The inspectors involved in Kirby were licensed under the Warehousemen Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.213" offset="9008692">That statute doesn't make them public officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.325" offset="9021127">There is no express statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.007" offset="9027919">The Court there therefore just had to analogize, or had to look at the case in terms of the statute and say, were these people acting for or on behalf of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.043" offset="9064072">They concluded, yes, they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.362" offset="9069296">So that case is an example clearly where someone was acting for or on behalf of the United States without any specific statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2843.483" offset="11513835">At the point federal control... federal control over these funds dissipates at the point that the money is properly paid, perhaps, to a contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.930" offset="11551556">I mean, at the point where federal regulation of the program ceases, of course, federal control over the funds would cease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2860.344" offset="11581231">In a vain attempt to avoid the plain language of this statute, petitioners, although it is undisputed that in the course of their administration of these funds they solicited and accepted $42,000 in return for their awarding particular contractors federal housing contracts, they argue that they were not acting in an official function or acting under or by authority of a branch of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.942" offset="11687602">This argument, as I have already detailed to some extent, is unavailing, because in performing the function of awarding federally funded housing rehabilitation contracts for purposes contemplated by federal law, they were clearly performing an important official function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2904.984" offset="11759804">They could only do so according to the regulations promulgated by HUD, and they were therefore acting under or by direction of that agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.199" offset="11788643">The legislative history, moreover, supports this construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.952" offset="11811631">As I went through a few moments ago, the legislative history of the statute demonstrates unequivocally that Congress intended to reach out broadly to include all persons who perform official functions on behalf of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.574" offset="11874116">And finally, and perhaps most importantly, the federal policies underlying federal bribery law clearly demonstrate the petitioners should fall within the definition of public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="2947.052" offset="11928033">The purpose of a federal bribery law is, of course, to protect the public against the corruption... or the evils of corruption in public service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.746" offset="11958857">The power that was used corruptly by petitioners in this case is an important governmental power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2964.112" offset="11996265">It is critical to the success of the Housing and Community Development Act programs that the authority to determine who receives federal contracts not be corrupted by bribery.</text>
