            <text syncTime="62.396" offset="384005">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="65.254" offset="395499">These consolidated cases are on appeal from the Supreme Court of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.535" offset="416605">They present a single issue, whether a Hawaii tax of 3 percent of the gross income of airlines from the airline business is exempt from the section of the Federal Aviation Act, 49 U.S.C., Section 1513, which forbids a state from levying a tax on the gross receipts derived from the carriage of passengers or the sale of air transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.803" offset="541680">The Hawaii Supreme Court upheld the Hawaii tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.614" offset="556935">Its decision thus conflicts with the holdings of the other state courts which have considered the same issue, namely, the highest court of the State of New York, the Court of Appeals of Arizona, and the Superior Court of Alaska, all of which have struck down similar state taxes because of this federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.181" offset="667172">Also, in the State of Ohio, the Attorney General rendered an opinion that the Ohio tax was invalid in view of the federal statute, and the Ohio legislature then repealed the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.551" offset="724641">Appellants Aloha Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines are commercial airlines flying in federal airways between the six major islands of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.248" offset="779394">I will make three points on oral argument, and only three.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.839" offset="797784">First, the plain language of the federal statute, 49 U.S.C. 1513, prohibits this tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.493" offset="832370">Second, the Hawaii tax can't be saved under subsection (b) of that federal statute because subsection (b) is consistent with subsection (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="187.002" offset="882421">And finally, the legislative history of this statute requires a decision in favor of the airlines in this case because Congress meant exactly what it said in Section 1513, and it meant to forbid precisely this kind of state tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.104" offset="962878">With regard to my first point, that the federal statute expressly prohibits the Hawaii tax, we need examine only the gist of the Hawaii tax statute and the key sentence of the federal statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.879" offset="1025990">First, the Hawaii statute says there shall be levied and assessed upon each airline a tax of 4 percent of its gross income each year from the airline business.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.279" offset="1087534">That language conflicts directly with the federal statute which provides no state... this is the federal statute... no state shall levy or collect a tax, fee, head charge or other charge directly or indirectly on persons traveling in air commerce or on the carriage of persons traveling in air commerce, or on the sale of air transportation, or on the gross receipts derived therefrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.184" offset="1251165">This federal statute thus expressly prohibits every conceivable method by which a state could tax the carriage of passengers by air or the sale of air transportation or the gross receipts derived therefrom.</text>

            <text syncTime="309.078" offset="1370702">I think there definitely is.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.218" offset="1375299">A gross income tax is a tax at the immediate point of transaction between a passenger and the airline, or between a customer and the provider of a service, and that is a tax which can easily be passed on dollar for dollar to the customer.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="327.196" offset="1443218">Well, you say that a gross income tax is necessarily one on the passenger?</text>
            <text syncTime="332.553" offset="1464638">I wouldn't have thought so, or perhaps I misunderstood you.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.584" offset="1476759">The statute is defined four different ways, to hit a tax directly on the passenger or a tax on the carriage of that passenger, or a tax on the sale of air transportation, or a tax on the gross receipts realized by the airline.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.887" offset="1553977">Yes, but what I am try... what I want to ask you is whether a gross income tax or gross receipts tax on the airline that is collected at the head office of the airline, it isn't imposed on passengers individually at all--</text>

            <text syncTime="440.667" offset="1897121">It did not want the states competing with that tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.133" offset="1914989">It did not want the states adding an additional tax up on top of the federal tax because that federal tax was the prime revenue raiser to fund the Congress' airport aid program, a program which funneled vast sums out to the states for the development of airports.</text>

            <text syncTime="514.981" offset="2194395">It then added an in lieu tax, but that would be taxes not prohibited by subsection (a), but certain in lieu taxes in other areas providing that the funds received from such in lieu tax go into airport development and improvement.</text>

            <text syncTime="616.799" offset="2601592">I'll tell you why.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.313" offset="2607652">And the Arizona case was exactly on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.094" offset="2622803">Section 1513 speaks of persons traveling in air commerce, and it also speaks in terms of carriage of persons traveling in air commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.698" offset="2677242">Air commerce is a defined term in the Federal Aviation Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.633" offset="2700961">It has several definitions, but one key definition is flights within the federal air space.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.566" offset="2744743">The flights of the two airlines before you today are entirely within the federal air space, so even if we were totally intrastate, we would be covered by this statute, and in fact, I would remind you, in the Arizona case, Cochise Airlines was flying between points in the State of Arizona; it was stipulated that that was intrastate, but because of that definition of air commerce, that airline's flights clearly came within the scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.192" offset="2879221">In subsection (a) Congress precluded all traditional forms of tax by specifically prohibiting any tax or any fee or any head charge, and it then went on to try and preclude preventive minds by prohibiting other charges to ensure that this prohibition would encompass any prohibited tax, however labeled.</text>
            <text syncTime="722.334" offset="3023730">Second, Congress broadly defined the subjects and measures of tax to be prohibited: namely, taxes, first, on persons traveling in air commerce; second, on the carriage of persons traveling in air commerce; third, on the sale of air transportation; and fourth, on the gross receipts derived therefrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.370" offset="3131877">And then finally, Congress extended this absolute prohibition to all taxes that are directly or indirectly levied or collected on any of these prohibited areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.723" offset="3197288">Congress thus meant to sweep the field clean of state taxes on air carriage, on gross receipts therefrom, and on head taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.405" offset="3252041">The plain language, I submit, of Section 1513(a) thus prohibits the Hawaii tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.245" offset="3283387">Now, the Director of Taxation of Hawaii attempts to avoid the effect of this language with several theories, mostly looking to subsection (b) of the federal statute, and our second major point is that these arguments should not prevail because subsection (b) is clearly consistent with subsection (a) which I have quoted with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.639" offset="3400939">After sweeping the field clean of gross receipts and head taxes, Congress added subsection (b) simply to clarify which state taxes are still permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.698" offset="3453183">This section provides that states may levy taxes other than those enumerated in (a), and then it lists property taxes, net income taxes, franchise taxes, and sales or use taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.096" offset="3518803">But the key clause in the subsection (b) is taxes other than those enumerated in subsection (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="855.545" offset="3556628">This clause clearly means that a state will be permitted to levy a tax if but only if that tax is not based on the carriage of passengers or the sale of air transportation or the gross receipts derived therefrom.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.461" offset="3632279">The Director argues that the Hawaii tax is a property tax and thus is permitted under subsection (b) because that is one of the listed taxes there, and he relies on a phrase in the Hawaii statute which says</text>
            <text syncTime="893.312" offset="3707721">"this tax is a means of taxing the personal property of airlines and other carriers. "</text>
            <text syncTime="902.012" offset="3742516">There are several flaws in this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="906.260" offset="3759443">First, the Hawaii tax is actually based solely on gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.913" offset="3794134">It therefore violates subsection (a) and is not permitted under (b) because the Hawaii tax is not one of those taxes other than those enumerated in subsection (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="928.828" offset="3849722">The Director, it seems to us, is therefore asking this Court to rewrite subsection (b) and to ignore that clause, taxes other than those enumerated in subsection (a).</text>
            <text syncTime="943.807" offset="3909699">But this clause cannot be ignored.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.322" offset="3923701">Secondly, the Hawaii tax is in no sense truly a property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.663" offset="3949092">The tax return used requires information only as to the airline's gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.097" offset="3982842">It requires no information as to the airline's personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.266" offset="4003531">The tax is only labeled as a means of taxing the personal property, and Justice Marumoto in his dissent below pointed out that Hawaii has no personal property tax as such, and there was none at the time this tax was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="990.054" offset="4094646">Federal standards are controlling here, and for federal purposes, I submit this is not a personal property tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="999.457" offset="4132263">The Director also argues that Section 1513(a) prohibits only taxes on gross receipts and not property taxes measured by gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.856" offset="4189836">But I submit this argument exalts form over substance and asks this Court to disregard the broad sweep of subsection (a) which forbids the use of gross receipts as the measure of a tax as well as the subject of a tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.880" offset="4265905">Finally, the Director argues that the Hawaii tax--</text>

            <text syncTime="1056.089" offset="4358796">We have protested and contested the tax back to the first effective year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.509" offset="4384501">The Director argues the tax is a general business tax which does not discriminate against airlines because other businesses in Hawaii bear a similar state tax on their gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.579" offset="4464749">The flaw in this argument is that unlike other businesses in Hawaii in general, the airline passenger fares are already burdened with an 8 percent federal excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.963" offset="4530264">In its wisdom, Congress determined that this federal tax is steep enough and that the states cannot tax air fares or tax the gross receipts of airlines from air transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.052" offset="4582614">Congress believed that any state taxes on top of the already steep federal tax would discourage air traffic and would reduce the yield of the federal tax, thereby depriving the airport and airway development program of the funds to carry out its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.309" offset="4667668">Finally, my last argument, and I will be brief, although resort to legislative history is not required because I believe we have a very clear federal statute here, I believe this legislative history clearly tells us that Congress meant to say exactly what it said in Section 1513, and meant to bar precisely the kind of tax here in issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1160.705" offset="4777278">In 1970 Congress found that the nation's airports and air control system were outmoded and inadequate to handle the massive growth in air traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.576" offset="4828687">Congress responded with a two-part program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1176.260" offset="4839450">First, it vastly increased grants of federal funds to the states for airport improvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.929" offset="4866199">And second, to pay for this program, it adopted a comprehensive and uniform program of federal taxes on passengers and on airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.409" offset="4916041">That comprehensive program has been considered and described by this Court in Massachusetts v. the United States in 1978 in a very able opinion written by Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1211.966" offset="4982287">The most significant tax in this federal program, and the largest revenue raiser by far is the 8 percent federal tax on all domestic air fares.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.069" offset="5038712">After this program took effect, Congress learned of efforts by states and localities to impose head taxes and gross receipts taxes of their own.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.798" offset="5097644">Congress regarded the state and local taxes as a threat to the revenue base underlying the 1970 airport development program, and in 1973 it enacted the Airport Development Acceleration Act which included this federal statute that I have been describing today, and it also included an additional increase in grants to the states for airport development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.331" offset="5227734">In fact, in the years in issue, this fine program has yielded $55 million to the State of Hawaii for airport and airway grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.639" offset="5272978">That is the six years after 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.044" offset="5282591">Also, we note that Congress recently acted to continue this program of grants and taxes until the year 1987.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.179" offset="5327103">So this decision is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.069" offset="5338702">The Solicitor General has filed an amicus brief in support of the airlines in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.817" offset="5373706">He has called the Hawaii tax a threat to the fiscal integrity of the federal airport development program.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.220" offset="5407352">In the Solicitor General's brief he points out that if this Court is to sanction the Hawaii tax, other states would regard the decision as an invitation to evade the federal prohibition by labeling their gross receipts taxes as a means of taxing personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1339.600" offset="5492824">Surely, Congress did not intend that its mandate be so easily evaded or that its national fiscal program be so easily undermined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.549" offset="5536605">Congress in its wisdom has determined that the steep federal tax on passenger air fares is all the taxation that air carriage of persons should bear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.030" offset="5582581">At the same time, the federal government has distributed substantial grants to the state, fueling a great improvement in the nation's airports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.714" offset="5617272">The plain words of the federal statute forbid this Hawaii tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.790" offset="5637543">The Court should not embark on an invitation to rewrite that plain language, and the Hawaii tax should be stricken and the decision below reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.425" offset="5688116">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.967" offset="5886333">Well, let me just answer that question right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1442.154" offset="5903051">The statute has to do with the same user taxes that were preempted by Congress under the Airport and Airways Development Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1453.165" offset="5947041">Congress had imposed an 8 percent ticket tax on domestic flights, a 3 percent enplaning tax on international flights, and a 5 percent tax on air transportation of goods.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.876" offset="6009944">Now, 1513(a) simply prohibits a tax on the air transportation of persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.935" offset="6046202">Also, it prohibits a tax on the air carriage of persons in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.027" offset="6078490">It also prohibits a tax on the sale of air transportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1491.352" offset="6099805">Those are the three taxes that are prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.585" offset="6108792">Those parallel, if you will, the federal taxes that have been preempted by Congress, and as we have indicated in our brief, those deal with specific subjects of taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.610" offset="6172844">Subsection (b) says except for the taxes enumerated in subsection (a)--</text>

            <text syncTime="1545.658" offset="6317040">One of the basic positions that we have that there's much... that there's a lot of difference between Congress taxing me and not taxing anyone else and Congress saying that I am singled out for an exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="1798.697" offset="7329232">Let's turn back to these practical considerations that I wanted to talk about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.959" offset="7366222">The Hawaiian tax here applies to all of the income from the business activities of these airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.534" offset="7404570">That is the public service company tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.359" offset="7415854">The airlines are here contending that only the tax as applied to their receipts from air transportation of persons is invalid, so they have asked for a specific deduction from the tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.151" offset="7471025">They are not claiming the tax is invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.229" offset="7479384">In addition, the airlines' pay on their nonoperating utility property a general business privilege tax measured by 4 percent of gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.316" offset="7539675">So they have paid into the state of Hawaii for the purpose of conducting substantial business activities in Hawaii as a public utility and otherwise of 3 or 4 percent of a tax... a tax on 3 or 4 percent of their total gross income from that business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.072" offset="7646672">Now, the Hawaii tax, indicating again the nature of its franchise, the Hawaii tax is due January 1, measured by the receipts of the prior year for the next ensuing calendar year, very much like a franchise tax for the privilege of doing business for the next year, very much like an ad valorem property tax where the tax is due on a specific date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.560" offset="7752625">In contrast, the 1513(a) tax is on a transactional type of tax for the furnishing specifically of air transportation services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.460" offset="7816259">So the tax computation under 1513(a) and the actual tax computation under the Hawaiian public service tax are entirely different.</text>
            <text syncTime="1936.657" offset="7881043">Now, the Hawaiian tax applies only to intrastate business in Hawaii, considering the interisland transportation as intrastate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1948.200" offset="7927227">For instance, United Air Lines, Northwest Orient, other airlines that fly in and out of Hawaii that do not do intrastate business pay no public service commission tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1962.521" offset="7984488">It is only on those utilities conducting a substantial intrastate business with employees, substantial properties, substantial business activities there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1975.126" offset="8034956">Now, the Hawaii tax also applies to all other utilities doing business in the State of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.199" offset="8087201">The public service commission tax applies to all utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.541" offset="8100576">Therefore, steamship companies, gas companies, electric companies, motor carrier companies, telephone companies and so forth all pay the same tax at the same or higher rate than the tax impose on the airlines in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.345" offset="8183854">In addition, comparable taxes are paid by every business in the State of Hawaii measured by gross receipts with the exception of life insurance companies and financial institutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2546.066" offset="10318685">It certainly has not been a... no general business taxes were discussed in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.032" offset="10346584">Two prime sponsors of the legislation were Senator Magnuson from the State of Washington and Representative Brock Adams, and Washington has a business and occupation tax measured by gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.336" offset="10427773">It includes the intrastate receipts of airlines, and no... and they were... Senator Magnuson and Adams, Representative Adams were prime sponsors of this kind of legislation, made no mention in the legislative history of this act about the Washington tax or any other general business taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.497" offset="10544383">In fact, the reason that we have published and printed this 187 page volume is simply to demonstrate to the Court that there is not one word in that volume having to do with general business taxes except one statement, and that was the statement of the representative of the airline industry, Mr. Tipton, and in reference to the Ohio discriminatory tax he said we oppose this tax because it singles out and discriminates against the airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.842" offset="10685758">But he very definitely said that the airlines had no objection in Ohio or elsewhere of paying their fair share of general business taxes along with other members of the business community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.055" offset="10746676">And what I think is the real differentiation here is there is a vast difference between being singled out, Congress singling out an industry from general business taxes for preferential purposes on the happenstance that they might... on the happenstance that those taxes are measured by gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.262" offset="10847508">There is a vast difference between that and singling out the airlines for discriminatory tax treatment by duplicating federal head taxes directly or indirectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2689.930" offset="10894111">And I think that is really the underlying question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.490" offset="10908426">I would like to emphasize, although I know that I have had some problems with it with this Court at the moment, but there is, there is a substantial difference between the public service company tax, a utility tax, and a tax directly on gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2716.404" offset="11000063">Now, I know there's much argument in the briefs of the airlines that there is no difference between a measure and a subject matter of the tax, but I believe if you do some real reflecting, you will have to realize you have got to have a subject of a tax because you can't measure nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.956" offset="11098284">There is in every taxing statute that I have ever seen two things, a subject and a measure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2753.170" offset="11147081">Now, if the measure, the Court might say the measure is the same as the subject and substitute, then, the measure for the subject, but you always have to have in place these two things.</text>

            <text syncTime="2802.712" offset="11345298">So it was a means of taxing, and then if you look at the definition of public utility in 269-1 of the Hawaiian statute, you see that in the definition of the public utilities they were trying to arrive at the growing concern value of these franchises and properties used by the utilities, and the easiest and most direct way to do it was to measure that by capitalizing net income, which we do many times in the utility field today, or taking the gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2839.307" offset="11491688">And those really are the same as property taxes because as was indicated, the 1982 amendment to 1513, by adding subsection (d) clearly indicates that in lieu of property taxes were covered by (d), and (d) had to do with the property taxes permitted under (b), so that in lieu of taxes are within the scope of property taxes under 1513.</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.556" offset="11640690">And I would suggest if other were not, then the Four R legislation under the Railroad Revitalization Act of 1975 and the same language in the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 would not become effective because on those utilities they talk about ad valorem property taxes, but obviously those statutes have been construed by the lower courts to include in lieu of taxes measured by gross receipts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.574" offset="11784677">So we think that traditionally in this country, for over a century, property taxes on utilities have been measured by gross receipts, and there's many decisions of this Court that uphold it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2926.880" offset="11841938">So if the question became whether this is indeed a property tax under (b), we submit that it really is.</text>

            <text syncTime="3081.787" offset="12461562">In those pages, this was... Senator Cotton of New Hampshire wanted to grandfather in the New Hampshire head tax, so he proposed to Senator Cannon, who was the sponsor of the legislation, an amendment to grandfather in the head tax of New Hampshire until the end of 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.181" offset="12571172">In that... and Senator Cannon agreed to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3116.288" offset="12599593">And in agreeing to it, he said that this covers only the head tax now in effect in the State of New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.142" offset="12642956">Now, the language submitted by Senator Cannon I believe is set forth on page 79 of the legislative history appendix is identical to the language of Sectin 1513(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.010" offset="12722473">In other words, that shows specifically a legislative intent that they were talking about the subject matter generally of head taxes, the direct or direct imposition of them.</text>

            <text syncTime="3189.789" offset="12893627">Ohio had imposed on airlines alone an excise tax on air transportation measured by the empaneling or depaneling of passengers, and the airline association and others were disturbed about that kind of specific discriminatory tax against airlines, and everybody agrees, to the extent there is any legislative history known about this, that the phrase "or gross receipts derived therefrom" had to do with that legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.837" offset="13033748">And I would like to close by saying you can go through this 187 pages of legislative history, you will hear the words discriminatory taxes, head taxes, or equivalent taxes and abuses.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard L. Griffith</label>
            <text syncTime="3374.856" offset="13633833">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.062" offset="13633729">Just a couple of quick points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.232" offset="13633624">My learned friend has described at length the Ohio tax as a discriminatory one, but I would point out to the Court that the Tax Commissioner of Ohio appeared before the House Commerce Committee and went to great lengths to list the various Ohio taxes and to show that in fact the Ohio tax was not discriminatory as compared to the railroads, the truckers, or other businesses, and he then submitted language to the Congress to permit a nondiscriminatory gross excise tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.466" offset="13633520">The Congress declined his invitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.278" offset="13633415">They did not accept his language, and I think that tells us that Congress was concerned about much more than discriminatory taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.852" offset="13633311">Finally, I would just point out that the Hawaii statute says that it is levied and assessed upon each airline a tax of 4 percent of its gross income each year from the airline business, and then it goes on later on to say that that tax is in lieu of the Hawaii general excise tax which is also a gross income, gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.434" offset="13633206">I have no further points.</text>
