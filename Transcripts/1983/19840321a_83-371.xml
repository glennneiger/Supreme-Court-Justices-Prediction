            <text syncTime="59.273" offset="386409">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="63.519" offset="403337">This case arose out of a multinational telecommunications conference held in Dublin, Ireland, in 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.017" offset="445342">That conference was attended by representatives of six European nations, of Canada, and by three members of our Federal Communications Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.774" offset="492362">Respondent ITT believes that the three attending Commissioners had engaged at Dublin in certain discussions that were hurtful to ITT's financial interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.442" offset="547010">In particular, ITT suspected that the three attending Commissioners had tried to encourage their European counterparts to enter into operating agreements with two American companies that the FCC had recently authorized to compete with ITT in the Atlantic market.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.560" offset="635513">Accordingly, ITT launched a three-pronged attack designed to prevent such discussions from happening again.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.712" offset="672084">First, it filed a rulemaking petition with the FCC challenging the authority of the attending Commissioners to take part in the kind of discussion held in Dublin and seeking the promulgation of rules to govern any future multinational conferences if any were in fact held.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.297" offset="754422">Secondly, ITT filed a complaint in the district court which also challenged the authority of the Commissioners to take part in the kinds of discussions held in Dublin and which sought declaratory and injunctive relief against such asserted ultra vires conduct in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.712" offset="836133">And third, in a different count of the district court complaint, ITT contended that the Dublin gathering and other European gatherings were meetings of the FCC within the meaning of the Sunshine Act and that those gatherings therefore had to be open to the European public and be governed by all of the other procedural requirements that the Sunshine Act imposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.574" offset="943549">The case as it comes here presents two questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.823" offset="956610">The first concerns the jurisdiction of the district court to entertain ITT's charge that the Commission had engaged in ultra vires conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.867" offset="1000705">The second question concerns the proper construction of the Sunshine Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="248.270" offset="1142393">I don't think there is, Justice O'Connor, because the FCC has scheduled additional conferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.470" offset="1167157">There is one meant to be held in Toronto next month, and they plan to attend.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

          <turn speaker="albert_g_lauber_jr" startTime="263.716" stopTime="316.991">
            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="263.716" offset="1204146">Well, that may depend on what the Court decides, who goes.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.512" offset="1215327">But since the Commission intends to have future consultations, I think the problem is likely to arise again.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.915" offset="1240927">I would like to address the jurisdictional question very briefly first.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.961" offset="1261093">Our position here is that the district court had no jurisdiction to consider ITT's charges of ultra vires conduct by the Commission, because ITT had already submitted that same ultra vires argument to the Commission in its petition for rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.233" offset="1334236">The Commission considered that ultra vires charge in denying the petition for rulemaking.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.652" offset="1359836">That denial was a final order of the FCC and under Section 402(a) of the Communications Act exclusive jurisdiction to review that final order lay in the Court of Appeals.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="316.991" stopTime="325.270">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="316.991" offset="1417201">Do you say the district court would have had no jurisdiction, Mr. Lauber, even had the ITT not submitted the matter to the Commission?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="albert_g_lauber_jr" startTime="325.270" stopTime="359.659">
            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="325.270" offset="1450324">Well, I guess I have two answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.565" offset="1463490">ITT claims both that there is enough difference between the two causes of action to give the district court jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.950" offset="1493061">We disagree with that because, even if there is some difference, they are similar enough that under this Court's reasoning in Whitney National Bank the district court would still lack jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.323" offset="1534543">But as a third position we say that, even if they had failed to make the ultra vines claim before the Commission, under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction the district court would have been required to stay its hand until the--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="359.659" stopTime="362.849">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="359.659" offset="1587938">That's not quite the same thing as saying they have no jurisdiction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="albert_g_lauber_jr" startTime="362.849" stopTime="425.510">
            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="362.849" offset="1600685">--That's correct, that's absolutely correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.627" offset="1607791">We contend, therefore, that because the claim was pending before the FCC the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider what was in effect a collateral attack on the FCC decision and an attempt to evade the statutory review procedures that Congress has mandated.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.525" offset="1691382">We think that reversal of the Court of Appeals on this issue is required by this Court's decision in Whitney National Bank, a case that ITT has not cited or discussed in either of its briefs in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.833" offset="1748643">If there are no further questions, I will now turn to the Sunshine Act issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.317" offset="1766511">The Sunshine Act's open meeting rules apply only to meetings of an agency, as defined in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.375" offset="1802769">Under the Act's definitions, a gathering that is attended by members of an agency is a meeting of the agency only if four distinct elements are present--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="425.510" stopTime="432.615">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="425.510" offset="1851356">Incidentally, Mr. Lauber, at whose instigation was the Dublin meeting closed?</text>
            <text syncTime="430.962" offset="1873090">The American Commissioners?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="albert_g_lauber_jr" startTime="432.615" stopTime="603.234">
            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="432.615" offset="1879778">--I am informed that the way... these date back to 1974, and I understand at the close of every multinational session, as the last item on the agenda, the various foreign participants and the Americans would decide when to have the next meeting and what might usefully be discussed there.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.844" offset="1956682">Then the staff level people would arrange the detailed agenda, the place to have it, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.605" offset="1983640">So that all the meetings were called by consensus, as it were, and the Dublin session I think was no exception to that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.338" offset="2014674">The four requirements of a meeting of the agency under the Act are:</text>
            <text syncTime="471.723" offset="2036199">First, that the members who attend must be a quorum of the full agency or a quorum of a subdivision authorized to act on behalf of the agency;--</text>
            <text syncTime="483.968" offset="2085100">Second, the attending members must engage in deliberations;--</text>
            <text syncTime="488.843" offset="2104640">Third, those deliberations must determine or result in joint conduct or disposition of official agency business;--</text>
            <text syncTime="498.508" offset="2143301">And finally, if those three things are met, the meeting, if such it is, must be a meeting of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.493" offset="2171200">If any one of these four definitional components is absent, the Sunshine Act can have no application.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.491" offset="2203278">We contend that, with respect to the multinational gatherings involved here, all four elements were missing.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.658" offset="2231908">But today I'd like to focus on just two of the definitional components: the first component, that is, a requirement of authorization to act on behalf of the agency; and the fourth element, that is, the requirement that the meeting be a meeting of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.713" offset="2312156">In our view, upon a proper construction of the Sunshine Act the district court was required as a matter of law to award summary judgment to the FCC on either of these two independently sufficient grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="556.207" offset="2374119">First, then, as to the authorization to act requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.597" offset="2391673">All parties here agree that the members who attended these European gatherings were not a quorum of the full Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.796" offset="2428453">At all relevant times, the Commission had seven members, so a quorum was four.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.838" offset="2448620">However, at no time did more than three members of the Commission attend the consultative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="581.682" offset="2475996">However, those three attending members were members and a quorum of a subdivision of the Commission, that is, the Telecommunications Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.770" offset="2516329">The question therefore is whether that committee, those three attending members, were authorized to act on behalf of the Commission at the European sessions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="603.234" stopTime="607.153">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="603.234" offset="2562200">So as to bind all seven, or a majority of seven, is that what you mean?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="albert_g_lauber_jr" startTime="607.153" stopTime="865.360">
            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="607.153" offset="2577874">Well, whatever the term "authorization" means, and I will now explain what we think it means.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.418" offset="2598981">We think it must be interpreted to involve some kind of power to bind the others.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.979" offset="2629178">We think that was absent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.945" offset="2637015">Now, in order to define whether or not the three attending members were in fact authorized to act on behalf of the entire body in Europe, one must turn to the organic statute that created the FCC, the Communications Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.439" offset="2703053">That statute, like most such statutes, has a provision which empowers the FCC to delegate its authority, either to panels of Commissioners, to individual Commissioners, to boards of employees, or to single employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.870" offset="2772747">The Communications Act provides that such a delegation of authority can be made only by published rule or by order.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.570" offset="2807542">It further provides that such a rule or order can be adopted, modified, or rescinded only by a majority vote of the full Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.470" offset="2847144">Now, in fact the FCC by rule has delegated a great deal of authority to various groups and individuals within the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.169" offset="2885910">Those delegation orders occupy some 20 pages in 47 CFR Subpart F.</text>
            <text syncTime="692.229" offset="2918197">Now, among these many delegation orders, only one delegates authority to the Telecommunications Committee as it formerly was.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.881" offset="2956754">That delegation order formerly authorized the committee to act upon applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity filed by common carriers under Section 214 of the Act above a certain dollar range.</text>
            <text syncTime="719.404" offset="3026866">Now, Section 214 applications are required to be filed by common carriers before they can acquire facilities to initiate new service.</text>
            <text syncTime="730.588" offset="3071588">Section 214 applications are handled in a relatively formal proceeding where the applicant submits a brief in support of his application, opponents, typically competitors, file opposing briefs, called petitions to deny, and the applicant then submits a reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.191" offset="3150060">On the basis of the pleadings, the committee or the full Commission will then either grant or deny the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.671" offset="3179944">Neither court below found or even suggested that the three attending Commissioners were acting on Section 214 applications in Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="773.943" offset="3245041">Moreover, those three attending Commissioners of that committee had received no other delegation of authority from the FCC to act on behalf of the Commission in Europe or anywhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.738" offset="3296241">Accordingly, in our view it's perfectly plain that those European... because the Commissioners had not been authorized to act on behalf of the FCC, those gatherings were not meetings of the FCC as a matter of law, and that's the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="803.323" offset="3362592">Now, the Court of Appeals agreed that the three attending Commissioners had received no formal delegation of authority from the full FCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.522" offset="3403343">Rather, the D.C. Circuit hypothesized that the FCC, in violation of the Communications Act, had made a sub rosa delegation of authority, not evidenced by a published rule or order, to the three attending Commissioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.705" offset="3472098">The court below based this hypothesis entirely upon inference, an inference it drew from the facts that the attending Commissioners went to Europe in their official roles and that they there discussed matters that were important to the FCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.823" offset="3540538">In our view, this reasoning is just plain wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.945" offset="3557048">First of all, we know of no authority for the proposition that an agency, in the face of an explicit delegations of powers provision in its statute, can somehow delegate authority in any other way.</text>

            <text syncTime="879.198" offset="3666031">I believe that there is something in the statute of the FCC which requires that it normally meet in Washington, D.C. I'm not aware if panels could conduct activities elsewhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="888.023" offset="3701348">It would be somewhat unusual, would it not, for a regulatory agency to hold meetings to take action in Dublin or Paris or Rome?</text>

            <text syncTime="899.800" offset="3748473">I think it would be unusual, but I am not sure whether there is any express provision mandating that they hold meetings in the continental U.S. But we will try and find out before the reply.</text>

            <text syncTime="1154.399" offset="4766831">I think the record does show that it was the FCC that requested that the Dublin session be closed when discussion came around to the issue of new carriers and services, and that the Europeans went along with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.191" offset="4822001">But what I'm talking about is the power to effect this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.485" offset="4847183">Congress clearly presumed that an agency would be able to know ahead of time whether it was going to have a meeting or not, and if the status of a gathering as a meeting depends not on an objective indicia of a delegation of authority by statute, but on some appellate court's inference about whether delegation had been illegally conferred, the agency can never know ahead of time whether a gathering will be a meeting or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.116" offset="4953763">Finally, we think that the Court of Appeals theory would facilitate a great deal of harassment of regulatory bodies by those who wish to frustrate the administrative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.532" offset="5007366">If authority to act can be inferred in the absence of an explicit delegation of power, people can go around filing lawsuits challenging almost any discussions members have as putative meetings under the Sunshine Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.870" offset="5076747">Such litigants would typically demand the right to have discovery as to all items, all information that might bear upon the existence vel non of a sub rosa illegal delegation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.534" offset="5131395">And we think this would convert the Sunshine Act into just another weapon that litigants can use to stifle administrative action they don't want to see happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.312" offset="5174550">So for all these reasons, it is our contention that the Court of Appeals was wrong in believing that authorization to act on behalf of an agency can be inferred in the absence of an explicit delegation of authority made pursuant to statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.868" offset="5244767">Accordingly, because there was no official delegation made here, summary judgment was dictated in favor of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.457" offset="5275069">I would like to pass over the next two components of the definition and go to the fourth one, that is, the requirement that the meeting be a meeting of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1293.295" offset="5322403">It is our position that even if one could infer authorization to act here, the European gatherings would not be covered by the Act, because even if meetings, they were not meetings of the FCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.682" offset="5376006">Now, requiring that a meeting be an agency meeting, Congress we think clearly intended that the meeting must be run by and under the control of the agency in question.</text>

            <text syncTime="1613.190" offset="6601985">We think it is quite clear here that the attending Commissioners were in no position to decree that the meetings be governed by U.S. law or be open to the public.</text>

            <text syncTime="1676.244" offset="6854223">And we think that to require the Commissioners to either forego the meeting or go and violate the law was not what Congress would have intended when it enacted the statute, because the Act was meant to impose procedural restraints on existing meetings, not to impose substantive restrictions on agency action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.311" offset="6942517">Therefore, again, even if one were to assume these were meetings, they were not meetings of the agency because they were not controlled by the agency, and therefore on that separate ground summary judgment was dictated in favor of the Commission.</text>

            <text syncTime="1725.772" offset="7052336">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.533" offset="7063412">Before addressing the FCC's legal arguments, there are a number of additional facts that I think should be called to the Court's attention to put this litigation in its proper context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.857" offset="7108656">In the mid-1970's there was a significant disagreement between the FCC and representatives of European governments as to the nature of the facilities that should be constructed to handle the increasing trans-Atlantic communications traffic.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.569" offset="7187546">Basically, the FCC favored use of satellites, the European governments favored the use of cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.346" offset="7214609">As a result of the give and take of the consultative process, meetings which had been going on, the FCC basically agreed to defer to the Europeans and authorized the construction of so-called TAT, for trans-Atlantic, 7, the TAT-7 cable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.060" offset="7289528">Now, at about the same time the FCC, which of course for many years has sought to foster domestic competition in the provision of communications services, also sought to apply these policies to the international arena and, in a significant departure from prior practice, it authorized a number of new companies to provide international service, even though they had never entered into agreements with the European governments with which they would have to deal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.826" offset="7416587">At about the time... and this is about the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.652" offset="7431843">At the time of the TAT-7 decision, authorizing TAT-7, Commissioner Fogerty, a key member of the Telecommunications Committee of the Commission, the committee charged with its express delegation of authority with authorizing construction of major new facilities, issued a concurring opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.268" offset="7514390">He stated that the FCC was deferring to the European governments even though he didn't believe that a new cable was appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1850.545" offset="7551484">But he went on to say, we expect the tit for the TAT, and specifically threatened that unless the European governments agreed to deal with the new American carriers the FCC would not listen to them in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.024" offset="7609371">This is October 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="1867.430" offset="7618984">The text is set forth in paragraph 8 of our complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.645" offset="7635807">In March '79 at a consultative process meeting, Commissioner Fogerty again made a speech seeing the tit for TAT, the quid pro quo, and making it clear he is not just speaking for himself but for the full FCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.000" offset="7693276">In May of 1979, Chairman Ferris of the Commission, and of course a member of the Telecommunications Committee, testified before Congress that the Commission was in the process of trying to apply leverage on the European governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.912" offset="7752940">But despite all this, when it came time for the October 1979 consultative process meeting in Dublin, not a single European government had backed down, not a single European government had acceded to the FCC demands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.403" offset="7818873">It's at this point that the FCC convened the closed meeting from which representatives of the American carriers were excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1926.649" offset="7855862">This was a basic departure from past consultative process meetings, which were open to all interested parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.773" offset="7884388">There's no question that this was done at the instance of the FCC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.864" offset="7900689">The FCC so admitted in its answer to interrogatories that we served, which are contained in joint appendix page 116.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.597" offset="7931618">They also admitted so in their brief to the Court of Appeals, as the Court of Appeals' decision memorializes on page 6 of that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.246" offset="7966204">The FCC then called this special meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.091" offset="7981668">I would also point out that there were nine representatives of the FCC, three Commissioners, six members of Commission staff, at the meeting, as compared to single representatives of six of the foreign governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1971.365" offset="8034749">That's in an interrogatory answer at joint appendix 108, 109.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.878" offset="8056796">ITT, being excluded from this meeting for the first time, it's correct, tried to find out what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.578" offset="8083546">It served a Freedom of Information Act request asking for documents about the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.595" offset="8107683">And it also filed a petition for rulemaking, basically questioning the wisdom and propriety of what the FCC was doing, but saying that at the very least the Commission should define what its representatives would be doing and establish some procedural safeguards for the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.493" offset="8179258">The Commission took no action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.973" offset="8189185">The FOIA request was denied in principal part by the Common Carrier Bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.331" offset="8210605">We appealed to the full Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.864" offset="8216770">The Commission did not act within the time required by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2021.142" offset="8233802">The Commission took no action on the petition for rulemaking that we filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.533" offset="8251356">They did, however, announce that there was going to be another closed meeting in England, this time in Ascot.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.903" offset="8280927">And at this point ITT filed the lawsuit that gives rise to the argument today.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.698" offset="8304019">Unlike ITT's petition for rulemaking, which focused on the future, basically calling on the FCC to establish some rules for the future, ITT basically bit the bullet and challenged the past propriety of what the Commission had been doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.252" offset="8378311">We specifically quoted what Commissioner Fogerty had said about threatening the European governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.812" offset="8400568">We urged and alleged that such conduct on behalf of an American administrative agency is ultra vines, that negotiations with foreign governments is the province of the State Department, not a regulatory agency, and we asked that that conduct be enjoined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.993" offset="8469218">We also stated that the conduct involving the joint conduct of agency business was subject to the Sunshine Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.365" offset="8502759">There was some preliminary discovery and a motion to dismiss was filed by the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.692" offset="8524075">We cross-moved for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.535" offset="8535360">Pursuant to the local rule, we identified eight statements of the Commission, of its... of Commissioners and of its general counsel, which described what the Commission was doing at consultative process meetings, what it proposed to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="2212.550" offset="8999503">They specifically represented to the court that there were no material facts in dispute in the case, and that's the posture then in which the case arose and in which summary judgment was granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.621" offset="9051748">The statements that we called to the court's attention, the district court and Court of Appeals, did not show general informal discussions, as the Commission states in the question that it presented to this Court when it asked that certiorari be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.003" offset="9117263">Rather, the statements clearly establish, to quote them, that the Commission was in a negotiating stance, was seeking a tit for TAT or a quid pro quo, that the Commission was applying leverage on the European governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2257.906" offset="9180898">And basically, at one point Commission Fogerty said: Well, we're going to go overseas and show we really mean business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.622" offset="9203781">These are simply not informal discussions involving general exchange of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.807" offset="9228545">With that background, I'd like to respond, then, obviously, to the FCC's arguments as to why the Sunshine Act they claim should not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2283.209" offset="9282148">We of course urge that it has been correctly applied, recognizing that the legislative history shows that there is to be a presumption of openness in government and that the burden of proof is on the administrative agency to justify departure from those principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.358" offset="9354664">The first point the FCC argues is that, and we all admit, no question, that there was not a quorum of the FCC as it then existed, although in all likelihood there will now... any future meeting involving the same three Commissioners will of course involve a quorum of the Commission as it now exists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.037" offset="9437420">The Sunshine Act is clear that the FCC applies... excuse me, the Act applies, not only to meetings of an agency, but to subdivisions of an agency that are authorized to act on behalf of the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2336.781" offset="9496352">Now, the Commission's argument before this Court is that because the Telecommunications Committee was not expressly authorized to participate in consultative process meetings and because its authority was limited to passing on applications for construction of major new facilities, whatever it did was unauthorized and therefore the Sunshine Act can't be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.911" offset="9600946">Now, we'd submit there can be no serious question as to the applicability of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.031" offset="9629368">We alleged in paragraph 10 of our complaint, joint appendix page 64, for several years representatives of the FCC, through its Telephone and Telegraph Committee and staff, as it was then called, have met with the Canadian and European telecommunications administrations to discuss facility planning.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.680" offset="9719960">The FCC's answer to our complaint, set forth at joint appendix 73:</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.065" offset="9741485">"Defendant admits that meetings of the type described in paragraph 10 have occurred. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.094" offset="9765622">In its order denying our petition for rulemaking, one of the statements on which we relied in support of our motion for summary judgment, set forth at page 165 of the joint appendix, this was the Commission's statement, the Commission:</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.996" offset="9829257">"We have undertaken to have Commission representatives meet face to face with them. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2434.896" offset="9888816">I might add, to the extent there is any question, Commissioner Fogerty had no doubt about his authority when he addressed the consultative process meeting in Montreal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.953" offset="9929044">At joint appendix page 165: "I think the Commission", he said...</text>

            <text syncTime="3635.507" offset="14691271">On the authorization to act requirement, ITT would interpret the words</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.191" offset="14718021">"authorization to act on behalf of the agency. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.844" offset="14732649">to mean something like "allowed to be there".</text>
            <text syncTime="3648.578" offset="14743621">We're not contending that the three Commissioners were acting illegally or improperly in going to Europe.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.090" offset="14769639">Our contention is they were not authorized to act on behalf of the FCC in Europe because they had no official delegation of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.543" offset="14807464">Secondly, apropos of Justice Marshall's question, if it were held that the Act applied to these European gatherings, that would require the FCC not only to dictate the open or closed nature of the meeting, but also to dictate the time, the place, the agenda, and all the rest of it.</text>
