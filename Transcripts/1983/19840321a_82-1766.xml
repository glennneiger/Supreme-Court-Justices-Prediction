            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="146064">We will hear arguments next in Securities Industry Association against the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.048" offset="242195">Mr. Pitt, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_l_pitt" startTime="94.110" stopTime="287.753">
            <label>Mr. Harvey L. Pitt</label>
            <text syncTime="94.110" offset="522436">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="98.164" offset="538632">At issue in this case is a dividing holding of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit which upheld a Federal Reserve Board ruling permitting Bankers Trust Company to market and corporate commercial paper notes for the first time since the Glass-Steagall Act was passed nearly 50 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.160" offset="622642">Both the Federal Reserve Board and the Court of Appeals concluded that the Glass-Steagall Act should be given a narrower reading than the literal language or its unmistakable legislative purposes would dictate.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.735" offset="676977">The court below in essence directed that the Federal Reserve Board should be free on a case by case basis to adapt the Glass-Steagall Act's flat prohibitions to current business reality and changing financial needs of our economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.314" offset="755240">It is our contention in this Court that that decision should be reversed, first because it ignores the plain language and leaves our financial system open to precisely the hazards that Congress had in mind when it enacted the Glass-Steagall Act over 50 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.295" offset="831204">Second, it's inconsistent with the specific policy choice that Congress made.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.866" offset="857431">When Congress considered the Glass-Steagall Act and the dangers that had given rise to that statute, it had before it the choice of absolute prohibition or case by case regulation with delegation to an administrative agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.958" offset="913855">Congress rejected regulation and chose absolute prohibition, as this Court has twice noted.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.529" offset="940082">For that reason, the court below erred in undoing the specific policy choice the Congress had made.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.683" offset="968712">And finally, the decision below represents a bad policy choice that not only is not justified by the statute and by its legislative history, but that, as recent events have shown, will substitute litigation and case by case administrative revisionism for resolving what bank activities are appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.500" offset="1067977">This would mark the first time in our history as a country and as a nation that any court has done so.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.570" offset="1096294">The factual background of this case is relatively simple and straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.093" offset="1126387">In 1978 Bankers Trust Company, which is a state bank which is a member of the Federal Reserve System, began underwriting commercial paper notes issued by third party corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.401" offset="1179573">The Federal Reserve Board ruled that this was legal, not because the statute didn't cover it, but because the statute shouldn't be read to cover it even though its literal terms so provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.243" offset="1234952">The court said... the Federal Reserve Board said that commercial paper is more like a bank loan, even though it is conceded that the bank is not lending anyone any money in the activity of distributing and underwriting commercial paper.</text>

            <label>Mr. Harvey L. Pitt</label>
            <text syncTime="299.395" offset="1343622">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.745" offset="1348951">But I might point out that since the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act no bank has ever underwritten commercial paper?</text>

            <label>Mr. Harvey L. Pitt</label>
            <text syncTime="312.904" offset="1397643">No bank has asked the Federal Reserve Board to be permitted to do so.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="317.706" offset="1416869">Were banks even doing that at the time of the enactment of the Glass-Steagall Act?</text>
            <text syncTime="322.010" offset="1434005">I kind of sensed in reading the briefs that the Glass-Steagall Act was not directed in its terms to that practice, and I wondered if banks say in the twenties, before the Glass-Steagall Act was passed, actually were doing that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_l_pitt" startTime="333.568" stopTime="397.308">
            <label>Mr. Harvey L. Pitt</label>
            <text syncTime="333.568" offset="1480294">There were some isolated instances of banks underwriting commercial paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.270" offset="1499102">But by and large, the overwhelming function at the time of the passage of the Glass-Steagall Act was for banks to purchase commercial paper, which is the equivalent of making a loan, and of course there is express authority for banks to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.379" offset="1559497">In our system banks are permitted to do that which is expressly provided, and they may not do that which is not expressly permitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.051" offset="1590217">In this case, the Glass-Steagall Act takes that regime a step further and says that banks, particularly state member banks and national banks and all banks, may not underwrite commercial paper notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.145" offset="1646642">It is unmistakable from the language of the statute that the statute prohibits the underwriting of notes, and no one disputes that issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.334" offset="1683318">The question is whether the Board is free to say that some notes will be treated in accordance with the literal language of the statute and other notes will not be treated in accordance with the literal language of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="419.488" offset="1823961">I'm a little unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.673" offset="1828663">Is commercial paper an investment security in the meaning of the term in Section 16?</text>

            <text syncTime="429.196" offset="1862831">--The point I am making, Your Honor, is that the term is not... that within the meaning of that term, commercial paper is not an investment security because the Comptroller of the Currency, an entity that is not involved in this case, has never defined commercial paper as an investment security.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="450.626" offset="1948513">But how about the statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="453.811" offset="1961261">I mean, was it intended that investment security incorporate commercial paper by Congress?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="harvey_l_pitt" startTime="461.334" stopTime="590.516">
            <label>Mr. Harvey L. Pitt</label>
            <text syncTime="461.334" offset="1991354">There is no indication that the statute need exclude commercial paper from that context.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.488" offset="2019984">It is simply not... it is not discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.856" offset="2033463">But the term "investment security", Your Honor, does not have any relevance to the issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.510" offset="2056033">The reason I state that is that we are here dealing with a specific bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.414" offset="2075677">In Section 21 the statute says that it is unlawful for any entity that engages in issuing, underwriting, selling or distributing funds, notes, debentures securities, and other securities from also taking deposits.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.392" offset="2151537">The term 21 without any qualifier and without any reference to investment securities or otherwise, and thus for this purpose it's irrelevant whether one deems commercial paper to be an investment security or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.802" offset="2209215">Section 16 of the Glass-Steagall Act has a flat prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.123" offset="2226456">It says that it shall be unlawful for any national bank to underwrite any issue of securities or stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.144" offset="2266580">There is absolutely no qualification whatsoever in that prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.779" offset="2285179">There are provisions in Section 16, however, which indicate... and this is the critical facet of the structure of the Glass-Steagall Act... that when Congress wanted to permit banks to underwrite specific securities, it knew how to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.890" offset="2349545">Appended to Section 16 is a laundry list of 15 securities that are in the form of notes that the Congress has directed banks may underwrite.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.198" offset="2402835">In Section 21, in 1935 Congress amended the provisions of Section 21 specifically to provide that banks might underwrite mortgage notes, because there had been the claim that mortgage notes would be encompassed within the broad prohibition against underwriting any notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.029" offset="2482142">Congress responded in '35 and gave banks that authority and said that the section should not prohibit that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="590.516" stopTime="596.769">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="590.516" offset="2508056">Do you disagree, then, with Judge Wilkie's opinion's reading of the word 21?</text>

          <turn speaker="harvey_l_pitt" startTime="596.769" stopTime="687.346">
            <label>Mr. Harvey L. Pitt</label>
            <text syncTime="596.769" offset="2533133">Absolutely, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.621" offset="2540448">Judge Wilkie's reading, which I think was a narrowing, and he conceded it was a narrowing, of the literal language, suggested that when one looks at the various entities that precede the word "notes"... the statute reads</text>
            <text syncTime="617.000" offset="2614008">"stocks, bonds, debentures, notes and other securities. "</text>
            <text syncTime="622.487" offset="2635951">--that one ought to view "notes" as potentially meaning notes for the raising of capital for permanent purposes for corporations.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.211" offset="2682867">Where he found those words we are not certain, but they don't appear on the face of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="640.615" offset="2708467">Moreover, he seized upon three factors which he indicated would determine when a note would be within the statute and not.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.721" offset="2744934">The three factors that he alluded to and that the Board has alluded to in this case are the denominations of the notes, the nature of the purchasers, and whether the notes were of prime quality.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.099" offset="2814420">None of those things have to do with whether the note is being used to raise capital or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.420" offset="2835736">So that after having totally taken the statute out of context and then relying on factors that bear no resemblance to the specific criteria he applied, he concluded that commercial paper notes were not within the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="689.631" offset="2904490">This is his functional analysis and the Board's functional analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.666" offset="2920686">And I might add that that functional analysis is precisely what the evil in this case is, because it substitutes a regime of case by case regulation for what Congress decided ought to be an absolute prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.176" offset="2978678">This is one of the instances in that period of legislation in which Congress said: We will not rely on Government regulation; we want prohibition; and when we think a bank ought to be able to engage in activity, we will so specify.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.285" offset="3043148">And there have been numerous examples of those specifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.256" offset="3059031">As I have indicated, in the relevant universe of the statute, Sections 21 and 16, there are two major categories that Congress deals with in the Glass-Steagall Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.064" offset="3106260">One are the instruments to which the Glass-Steagall relates, and second are the activities which are prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.568" offset="3136248">A careful review of the statute shows that both the instruments to which the statute relates and the activities prohibited are all-encompassing.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.173" offset="3174701">There are no activities that are not governed by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="760.727" offset="3188911">One need only look at the listing of terms... stocks, bonds, debentures, notes, and other securities... to understand that Congress had in mind all instruments by which corporations obtain any form of capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.070" offset="3254322">Second, when one looks at the specific activities in the statute, it is equally clear that Congress parsed out and covered every conceivable activity that a bank could engage in in the context of these instruments.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.414" offset="3311687">It dealt with purchasing, selling, issuing, underwriting, distributing.</text>
            <text syncTime="796.817" offset="3333316">The statute is unmistakable in terms of its breadth and its scope.</text>

            <text syncTime="809.791" offset="3385143">In your view, is Section 16 totally redundant?</text>

            <text syncTime="818.064" offset="3418266">Section 16 by its terms applies only to national banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.866" offset="3433522">Section 21 applies to any deposit-taking institution.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.622" offset="3460480">Both contain co-equal prohibitions on underwriting, but Sections 16 and 21 have different formulations with respect to certain activities of banks that are not involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.846" offset="3509382">For example, with respect to investment securities, there are distinctions that are made in Section 16 that are not made in Section 21 for different types of entities.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.070" offset="3562253">But both provisions are unmistakable in providing the universe of deposit-taking institutions, that they may not underwrite notes or other securities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1249.545" offset="5144229">The contemporaneous legislative history of the Glass-Steagall Act I think makes quite clear that commercial paper is both a note and a security for purposes of these prohibitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.173" offset="5210684">We start with this Court's decision in the Camp case, which held that the term "security" should be construed broadly, not just literally but broadly and flexibly to accomplish its purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.231" offset="5262929">Indeed, in the four decisions of this Court that have defined terms in the Glass-Steagall Act this Court has continually urged that those terms are not to be given a narrow or restrictive reading, but are to be given a broad reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.674" offset="5316742">In this case, we simply urge that they be given at a minimum their literal reading, as well as accomplishing the regulatory purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.529" offset="5356134">The structure of the Glass-Steagall Act, as I've indicated, confirms that "notes" were intended to have its plain meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.833" offset="5385391">In addition, if one looks at other legislation, both contemporaneously and other banking legislation, it is clear that when Congress wanted to qualify the types of notes that it was restricting it knew how to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.295" offset="5447145">For example, there are statutes in which Congress refers to capital notes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.680" offset="5464699">Section 16 itself refers to notes commonly known as investment securities, for which there is a limited authorization of purchase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.019" offset="5498136">The fact of the matter is that in every instance in which Congress wanted to restrict the scope of its prohibitions it said so and it did so plainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.910" offset="5545679">Moreover, one need look at the securities laws, which were enacted at exactly the same time and by exactly the same Congress and by exactly the same committees to understand that Congress clearly understood commercial paper to be a note.</text>
            <text syncTime="1365.586" offset="5608373">In the Securities Act of 1933, Congress specifically defines "security" to include any note.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.525" offset="5640137">Senator Glass, one of the architects of the Glass-Steagall Act, went before the committee when it was considering the '33 Act and suggested that perhaps the Congress ought to exclude commercial paper, specifically commercial paper, from the provisions of the Securities Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.403" offset="5715579">Congress rejected that suggestion, but adopted a narrow prohibition against requiring registration.</text>

            <text syncTime="1501.708" offset="6152869">Beyond that, in 1935 when Congress amended the Glass-Steagall Act with some technical amendments, Congress did put in an amendment to Section 21 of the Glass-Steagall Act, as I have indicated, allowing banks to underwrite mortgage notes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.302" offset="7259207">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.152" offset="7270596">All those of us who have persevered through the several briefs filed on both sides and by the allies of Petitioners and Respondents must come away with the sense that two quite different statutes are being discussed, both purporting to be the Glass-Steagall Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.952" offset="7365786">The one that is pictured by Petitioners and their allies is an uncompromising ban on the marketing of anything by commercial banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.177" offset="7414688">All the emphasis in their briefs is on the activity or the transaction which the Act prohibits, with no attention to the character of the instrument that is being dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.537" offset="7480203">But unsurprisingly, the Glass-Steagall Act is not quite that simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.424" offset="7503713">To be sure, sometimes the prohibitions of the Act do turn on the kind of business activity involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.962" offset="7537881">For instance, where stock is the security in question, banks may act as brokers for their customers, but they may not purchase stock, shares of stock, for their own account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.372" offset="7599530">That indeed is the difference, as we read it, between the two most relevant decisions of this Court, ICI I and ICI II, as they're referred to.</text>

            <text syncTime="1878.215" offset="7658880">But on the other hand, as often, the prohibitions of the Act depend on the character of the instrument, and the most obvious example is shown in the provision which exempts Government bonds and Government insured bonds from any of the prohibitions of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.699" offset="7764833">They may be underwritten, they may be sold, they may be distributed, they may be purchased without limit by a commercial bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.555" offset="7800255">Not so with respect to bonds not issued by Government or not insured by Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1921.125" offset="7830557">The short of it is that there is no universal prohibition in the Glass-Steagall Act against underwriting or marketing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1930.665" offset="7868696">It depends on what sort of instrument is at stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1935.051" offset="7886250">The question here as we view it is whether commercial paper is wholly outside the prohibitions of the Glass-Steagall Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.407" offset="7927628">We do not claim an exception, an exemption in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.728" offset="7948944">Our straightforward position is, the Glass-Steagall Act has nothing whatever to do with commercial paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.250" offset="7983008">It was not intended to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1960.869" offset="7989486">So far as the Glass-Steagall Act is concerned, commercial paper can be bought, sold, underwritten, marketed, framed, used for kindling, absolutely indifferent to the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2268.202" offset="9218808">They are not, also, offered to the general public, unlike bonds, debentures and stocks, which have that in common, that there are public offerings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.427" offset="9267710">But this is not the only reason why 21 ought not be given the broad reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.998" offset="9289966">Section 21, after all, is not the section addressed directly to banks; it's Section 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.735" offset="9312954">And we oughtn't to read into Section 21 anything that isn't in Section 16 as a prohibition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.972" offset="9337927">Indeed, there's a proviso to Section 21 which tells us precisely that: Nothing which is permitted in Section 16 is prohibited by this section, notwithstanding, in effect, the broadness of the terms as some untutored person might read it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2564.860" offset="10405499">As we view it, Justice Blackmun, this is not an investment banking operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.585" offset="10448340">It is an arrangement of a loan, something which is proper for commercial banks to be doing, something traditionally which they have done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.606" offset="10488464">It is functionally no different than a sale of a participation in a loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2592.777" offset="10517094">It is therefore an attempt to recapture some small part of a very traditional commercial banking activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.550" offset="10552203">Now, in our view there are at least three independent supports for the conclusion we draw.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.043" offset="10602149">First, the literal passing of the statute leads us to the conclusion that, since commercial paper is not an investment security, it therefore must be, if covered, a security.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.450" offset="10659827">And yet, we know that commercial banks are forbidden to purchase securities, except investment securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2637.575" offset="10696294">And yet, we know that commercial banks have and may continue to purchase commercial paper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.395" offset="10723566">Therefore, commercial paper cannot be a security within the meaning of Section 16.</text>
            <text syncTime="2649.883" offset="10745509">Now, the answer given to this seemingly unanswerable argument is that the purchase of commercial paper is authorized by the first portion of Section 16, which is in fact a holdover from the Banking Act of 1864.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.046" offset="10826175">That is a very awkward way to look about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2674.081" offset="10842371">It appears that the Glass-Steagall Act was not amending the Banking Act and changing the traditional activities of banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.354" offset="10879465">It was simply turning to a wholly new subject and saying, as the text suggests, now with respect to something else, dealing in securities, the rules shall be the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.029" offset="10942159">And it appears that that category of dealing in securities is nothing to do with the discounting or negotiation of promissory notes, an activity which before and since has been authorized to banks.</text>
            <text syncTime="2720.395" offset="11027631">The legislative history of Glass-Steagall again leads us to the same conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.335" offset="11067337">It is no inadvertence that the text fails to deal with commercial paper dealings, because bank purchases of commercial paper were common long before Glass-Steagall and continued to be so afterwards and were so at the time it was enacted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2751.264" offset="11151034">Congress had occasion to focus if it wished to deal with commercial paper, but did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2758.604" offset="11180395">On the contrary, the only mention of commercial paper in the legislative history of Glass-Steagall is a regret that banks have abandoned their good old habits of loaning on commercial paper and have turned to dealing, underwriting, and otherwise involving themselves with speculative securities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2781.767" offset="11273078">And it was against that danger, which had in the view of Congress caused the bank failures, that Congress now turned its face of 1933.</text>

            <text syncTime="3135.931" offset="12689751">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3139.050" offset="12702185">I've only one short point remaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.919" offset="12717649">It is this: that commercial paper, because it is indistinguishable from a short-term commercial loan, has always been so treated by all three of the bank regulators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.765" offset="12801032">And if I can draw the Court's attention to the joint appendix, in which the Board's statement in this case is reproduced at page 130.</text>
            <text syncTime="3175.656" offset="12848680">The paragraph beginning at the bottom of that page, the Board says the following:</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.560" offset="12876265">"The present attitude of the bank regulatory agencies is consistent with the view that commercial paper is properly viewed as a loan, not as an investment security. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.636" offset="12924539">"The instructions of each of the three federal banking agencies for preparation of call reports direct that commercial paper be treated as a loan. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.659" offset="12964663">"In addition, the Federal Reserve's Manual of Examination Procedures follows the same position. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.479" offset="12991935">That of course is relevant on a day to day basis for each bank to determine whether the limits applicable to loans or the limits applicable to investment securities are applicable when it takes in commercial paper into its inventory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.928" offset="13077721">From 1927 to this day, the banking fraternity, with the approval and indeed at the direction of the banking regulators, has treated commercial paper in the category of loans, not investment or security.</text>
            <text syncTime="3255.192" offset="13166746">Now, this kind of decision as to which category commercial paper falls in is precisely one as to which there is properly owed deference to the bank regulators.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.935" offset="13225783">It is not, as is suggested on the other side, that Congress made the Board or the Comptroller regulators in the sense that they were given discretion to waive in appropriate cases the prohibitions of the Glass-Steagall Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3287.063" offset="13294224">Of course they have no such discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.031" offset="13306136">But they do have a job to construe, to interpret the words of the statute which they are required to enforce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.954" offset="13345842">And it is in that sense that deference is due to their special expertise.</text>

            <text syncTime="3469.333" offset="14023354">My impression is not so because, with respect to the securities laws, it's perfectly clear that, while commercial paper is a covered security, it is exempted from the registration requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3485.009" offset="14086048">And the Board has looked to the definition of a peculiar kind of commercial paper in the securities laws, so the two are meshed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3499.018" offset="14142054">I need only invoke what this Court twice said, both in ICI I and in ICI II, about the deference that is indeed due to the regulators, whether the Comptroller or the Board, provided however, which is what was lacking in ICI I, that that regulator not merely announce a rule, but do so by articulating his reasons for having got there in what is certainly present here, a comprehensive and careful parsing of legislative text, the legislative history, the policy as identified by this Court which informed the passage of the Act, and only then, after this careful articulation, reach a conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3702.850" offset="14957388">In response to the questions both by Justice White and Justice O'Connor, I would refer the Court to page 26, note 33, of the SIA's opening brief, which indicates that both the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Securities Exchange Commission had to take emergency action to obviate the impact on both the federal energy laws and the SEC's authority under the Public Utility Holding Company Act because of the Board's unprecedented ruling involving management interlocks and related issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3736.488" offset="15091971">Secondly, in response to Justice O'Connor's question, the SEC has recently promulgated a proposed rule which would undo the very statutory exemption to which Justice O'Connor was referring.</text>
            <text syncTime="3750.562" offset="15148291">That is to say, the federal securities laws presently exempt banks from the definition of brokers and dealers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.616" offset="15172428">The SEC has said that, in light of the activity of the banking agencies... and it's the decision in the court below which has been the mainspring from which all of these decisions have flowed... it is necessary for that agency to reconsider whether the exemptions given to banks from these definitions are appropriate.</text>
