            <text syncTime="75.109" offset="453785">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="79.243" offset="470295">The state police without a warrant, probable cause or exigent circumstances searched the Petitioner Oliver's farm and found marijuana growing in a corn field.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.533" offset="527450">Oliver moved to suppress the evidence in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.016" offset="541348">That motion was sustained.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.917" offset="548975">A panel of the Sixth Circuit affirmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.321" offset="558588">On petition for rehearing en band the Sixth Circuit held that the per se open fields doctrine permitted the state police to conduct the open field search, and that holding by the Sixth Circuit was contrary to the position of seven other circuits who have rejected the per se open fields doctrine as well as most of other state courts--</text>
            <text syncTime="126.175" offset="658063">The issue presented in this case is whether the Court's decision in Katz decided in 1967 holding that the Fourth Amendment protects an individual if he has an actual and a reasonable expectation of privacy modified the per se open fields doctrine to the extent of regarding a search warrant or requiring a search warrant for the search of a highly secluded field from whence the public is excluded and where a reasonable expectation of privacy is shown to exist on behalf of the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.590" offset="811663">The facts in this case are that a police officer, a Kentucky State Police officer, received an anonymous tip and based on that anonymous tip, the anonymous tip being that these was marijuana being grown on the Oliver farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="180.973" offset="877178">Based on that tip he and another police officer without a search warrant and without probable cause and without having any exigent circumstances proceeded to Mr. Oliver's farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.099" offset="921690">Mr. Oliver's farm has proved to have been 22 miles from the nearest town in a very, very remote area of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.145" offset="957948">To get to the field that they ultimately found the marijuana growing in it was necessary for the police officers to enter Mr. Oliver's property, drive several hundred yards to his house and then continue driving nearly another mile into the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.670" offset="1051989">During this travel according to Mr. Oliver and there is some dispute about the number, but there were a number of posted No Trespassing signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.726" offset="1092218">They traveled on beyond the house as I say for another mile when they came upon a locked gate blocking the roadway.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.274" offset="1126386">This locked gate also had on it a No Trespassing sign.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.516" offset="1147388">The officers parked their car not being able to go beyond that gate in the car and walked around the gate.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.281" offset="1178422">This area was fenced within the farm and the proof is that the farm had boundary fences around it as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.027" offset="1213426">After going past this gate or walking around this gate they proceeded about a quarter of a mile on when someone yelled to them,</text>
            <text syncTime="274.593" offset="1251669">"Come back. "</text>
            <text syncTime="275.784" offset="1256476">"There is no hunting allowed in this property. "</text>
            <text syncTime="278.817" offset="1268597">The officers walked back to the barn on the camp or where this person was standing and they could not find the person that they had seen who yelled at them.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.051" offset="1301511">So they proceeded on for another approximate quarter of a mile until they get into the property to the field approximately a mile and a half.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.717" offset="1344143">They traveled on that last journey, that last quarter mile journey, they travelled apart of that way through very dense underbrush and very dense wooded area.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.045" offset="1389491">They finally came upon the corn field and they could only when they got to that corn field observe that marijuana was growing in the corn field.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.683" offset="1432019">They could not see that marijuana from any other position until they had driven back approximately a mile and a half and stood actually on the field or in the field.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="330.509" offset="1475382">That is they could not see.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.500" offset="1483323">I suppose somebody in a helicopter could.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_e_haddad_jr" startTime="334.903" stopTime="407.693">
            <label>Mr. Frank E. Haddad, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="334.903" offset="1492936">Yes, they could.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.593" offset="1499728">The situation that we have here is that the officers after finding this marijuana they came back out and while traveling on the road they saw Mr. Oliver and ultimately arrested him and charged him with manufacturing and growing marijuana in violation of the federal statute that was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.410" offset="1602964">The holding in Katz and many cases before the Katz case was that searches conducted outside the judicial process without prior approval by a magistrate were per se unreasonable subject to a few well delineated exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.001" offset="1673286">The government in this case contends that the open fields doctrine is the exception in this case, that this search should be held legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.159" offset="1713932">Our contention is that since Oliver excluded the public... the distinctions we will make in a moment... this was not an open field since he had excluded the public and took such precautions as I have outlined to exclude everyone from it.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="407.693" offset="1784149">So you are not asking us to overrule the Hester case then?</text>

            <text syncTime="411.132" offset="1797837">--No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.524" offset="1803375">The definition of open fields has changed through the years.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.968" offset="1821243">In Hester the Court held that the police could search in an area from which they are not excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.544" offset="1855516">There are other views of Hester holding that it is a per se open fields doctrine.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="429.908" stopTime="438.472">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="429.908" offset="1872966">Do we know that much about the facts in Hester, Mr. Haddad?</text>
            <text syncTime="433.417" offset="1886967">It is just that very kind of conclusory statement in Justice Holmes' opinion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_e_haddad_jr" startTime="438.472" stopTime="671.585">
            <label>Mr. Frank E. Haddad, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="438.472" offset="1907238">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.512" offset="1911418">I think that you are correct in that, but there was a holding there or some holding to the effect that the defendant himself is who led the police to the evidence by passing the jugs of whiskey to the other person that was on the property at the time which the officers were able to observe.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.576" offset="1987591">They also held in that case that there were other people who came onto and off of the property even while the officers were there and after the arrest had been made.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.762" offset="2028342">So we next come to the Olmstead case about four years later when there was a holding that has been referred to as the per se locational theory, and that was that anything outside of the curtilage was considered to be an open field and no warrant was needed.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.497" offset="2119353">In the Katz decision this Court rejected the Olmstead's per se theory of the open field doctrine, and in more recent cases since Katz the holding has been that a field is not open if the public was excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.060" offset="2197615">In the Air Pollution Variance Board v. Western Alfalfa case decided in 1974 the Court analyzed that a federal agent can trespass onto an area where the public is not excluded and view that which was exposed to the public without violating the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.791" offset="2276505">So they held that if the public was not excluded the area was an open field, and in that case they held, which was an OSHA warrantless search case, they held that the search was okay and legal.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.222" offset="2330213">In Marshall v. Barlow a few years later, some four years later, this Court using the same analysis held that without a warrant the government agent is in no better position that a member of the public and observations capable of being made by the public can be made by the agent without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.024" offset="2417462">In that case the Court held as unconstitutional the authorization under the OSHA Act or search without a warrant because it permitted a warrantless government agent to search in an area where the public was excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.126" offset="2481828">So we get into that fine distinction that this Court has made that if the public was excluded the area is not an open field.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.701" offset="2516100">If the area is not an open field then the Fourth Amendment applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.773" offset="2536371">If the Fourth Amendment applies then we must use the two-part Katz test to determine if the Fourth Amendment has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.659" offset="2572002">When we look at the first part of the Katz test which is was there an expectation of privacy we find in this particular case that this man had his property fenced.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.689" offset="2624038">He had it posted throughout with No Trespassing signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.783" offset="2640443">He had a gate to the road which had a chain and lock on it.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.744" offset="2656326">There was a travel back into the farm approximately a mile and a half into a secluded area through wooded areas to find the marijuana growing in the corn field.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.122" offset="2705854">There was also the additional, which the Sixth Circuit dissenting opinion put a lot of weight upon... There was also the additional fact that somebody on the property had hollered to the police officers that no hunting was allowed and to come back or to come back, no hunting was allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.873" offset="2776802">So when we apply that and as the District Court judge said in his memorandum... opinion, short of guards at the entrance it is difficult to see what else the defendant could have done to assert his privacy interest in the property--</text>

            <text syncTime="1033.805" offset="4288561">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.955" offset="4301099">In State of Maine v. Richard Thornton the area in question was not as a matter of fact akin to an open field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.373" offset="4342791">The area by its very nature of being a heavily wooded area was not akin to an open field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.108" offset="4373720">It was not a field for one thing, and it was not open in any sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.303" offset="4398588">If you will look at the information in this case starting from the affidavit by the police officer after he had made his warrantless search they made reference to an informant here who had told about marijuana growing in back of someone's trailer home in a heavily wooded area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1084.908" offset="4492943">The police officer said in the affidavit as well that he went to the heavily wooded area and saw what he wanted to see and then asked the magistrate to give him a search warrant to search the heavily wooded area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1099.108" offset="4549785">Also at the suppression hearing it is very clear from the record that the area searched was in fact woods and not fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.475" offset="4591268">There were photographs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.117" offset="4597746">An aerial photograph in particular showed that the complete property except for some very small patches, smaller than this table, were in fact open.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.002" offset="4645289">The rest of it was a completely heavily wooded area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.985" offset="4661276">The police themselves made testimony that the area that they searched was heavily wooded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.150" offset="4685935">Mrs. Thornton's testimony, the defendant's wife's testimony, was also that the area was heavily wooded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.885" offset="4712894">Therefore, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine should be free as a matter of fact to determine that the nature of the particular area was not an open field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.994" offset="4761273">It was in fact closed woods and secluded woods.</text>

            <text syncTime="1173.989" offset="4849253">Mr. Chief Justice, my feeling on that would be that if they made an aerial search that may have been enough to establish probable cause to get a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.745" offset="4892303">Well, in my situation it may have been difficult to in fact observe marijuana growing because the patches were so small in this heavily wooded area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.831" offset="4928665">Perhaps if they had binoculars they might have been able to see them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.514" offset="4943398">But if it were a large area and they were easily seen, then that would have been enough to establish probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.888" offset="4976835">But in fact there would be not a privacy violation from the air to the extent of the privacy violation of police actually coming onto your property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.348" offset="5026677">In terms of the individual's expectations the individual expects that people are not going to come onto his private property, but the individual does not have as great an expectation that people may not see things from the air.</text>
            <text syncTime="1233.779" offset="5088430">It is important to note that there is no definition of open field in the Hester case, and I think because of that Maine certainly should be free to determine whether or not an area searched is an open field or it is not an open field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.371" offset="5162827">It is important to note also that the Maine court never rejected the open fields doctrine nor did they reject Hester.</text>
            <text syncTime="1260.446" offset="5195114">In fact, they have applied the open fields doctrine in cases in Maine and they cited three or four cases in the opinion where the open fields doctrine had been applied stating--</text>

            <text syncTime="1357.879" offset="5584861">Then the court cited 18 Maine cases to support that decision of whether or not there was a search.</text>

            <text syncTime="3538.887" offset="14308923">I do not think so and to talk about Hester for a minute I think it is not true that Hester does not have to be overruled or at least substantially modified for Oliver to prevail in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3549.396" offset="14350928">The facts in Hester are that the police knew that they were on Hester's property and the record although it is not reflected in the opinion but the record suggests that they climbed over one or two fences to get there so I do not know that that case is very different from this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.192" offset="14402128">I think the Court's decision there reflects a common sense understanding that these sorts of places are not really in a practical sense restricted from outsiders and if people are going to do things in those fields they are exposing them to some extent to be seen by other people and the police have the same rights that the other people do to see these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="3585.278" offset="14494393">I think it is important... The Fourth Amendment to some extent is a matter of probabilities, and I think it is important to focus on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.224" offset="14530233">Even the warrant clause recognizes the possibility that police may make an unjustified intrusion into a private area if police get a warrant on probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.403" offset="14590941">In some not insignificant percentage of those cases their suspicion is going to turn out to be unfounded, and they are going to make an intrusion into the home that invades serious privacy interests and that is not warranted by law enforcement interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.704" offset="14652172">That is the reason we have the warrant and probable cause requirement to minimize those entries as much as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3631.379" offset="14678817">Now in the case of a field it just does not make sense to have the same sort of requirements because there is very little privacy value in what goes on in a field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.916" offset="14716956">People just do not engage in the sort of private matters that the Fourth Amendment was intended to be directed at when they are out in their fields.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.079" offset="14753632">So let's assume the police go onto a field with less suspicion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3653.592" offset="14767738">Let's say they have only 5 percent reason to think that there is marijuana in the field and in 95 percent of the entries they turn out to be wrong, but in those 95 percent of the entries they do not see anything except cows and corn and trees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.274" offset="14826461">It does not really matter so it just does not make sense to erect this kind of barrier which is going to have a serious impact on law enforcement to protect what is basically a theoretical privacy interest or one that is going to exist in only very unusual cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3687.234" offset="14902216">I would also like to talk briefly about looking at this case from the standpoint of the land owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.761" offset="14940355">I think the facts in this case are not very strong for an expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3701.243" offset="14958327">The police walked directly onto the field without any barrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3705.837" offset="14976717">The idea that the No Trespassing sign somehow creates a significant expectation of privacy I think just does not accord with reality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.123" offset="15009841">The stipulation in this case was that there was a No Trespassing sign when the officers left the highway and entered into the beginning of Mr. Oliver's farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="3724.868" offset="15052786">This was even before they came to the house.</text>

            <text syncTime="3757.862" offset="15184757">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.955" offset="15201161">The core area analysis set forth by the State of Maine in that a core area and the house are the only areas subject to Fourth Amendment right is a theory that was specifically rejected by United States v. Chadwick and upheld by other cases in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3783.879" offset="15288828">The contention by the State that people would be able to buy land and fence it and grow marijuana any way they want to without the police being able to do anything about it, of course, has no merit because the police can get a search warrant as they have in the past and as they will in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="3804.614" offset="15371793">In terms of the body or kidnap victim being on the premises certainly the police would be able to go in without a warrant because those circumstances have been held to be exigent circumstances in state courts as well as in federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.465" offset="15443160">I would like to take a look at the policy reasons which do not justify abandonment of the Fourth Amendment reasonable expectation of privacy analysis in favor of a per se exception.</text>

            <text syncTime="3836.895" offset="15500943">This Court has never extended that to open fields.</text>

            <label>Ms. Donna L. Zeegers</label>
            <text syncTime="3842.591" offset="15523721">Well, in terms of the per se exception this Court, of course, has never extended that to open fields, but if you look at the reasons for the exception to the warrant requirement that this Court has upheld we have seen that they have been in the context to preserve the safety of police officers, to prevent the loss or destruction of evidence or in the special nature of a government interest such as inventory searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3876.061" offset="15657573">We have seen hot pursuit, exigent circumstances, automobile searches, searches incident to an area surrounding a lawful arrest, the search of a border, the consent search, the stop and frisk.</text>
            <text syncTime="3891.575" offset="15719640">Of course, these are none of the situations presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3897.248" offset="15742314">It is important to note that the possibility for police abuse is manifest if we adopted a per se exception because we would need no probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3910.565" offset="15795604">We would allow indiscriminate searches by police to continually hope to find evidence of a crime instead of the general rule that all warrantless searches are per se unreasonable except for a few carefully guarded exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3927.255" offset="15862373">The bright line rule proposed by Petitioner in this case will alter that general rule to the extent that all warrantless searches are per se reasonable except those searches of houses and the core area.</text>
            <text syncTime="3941.464" offset="15919215">This I would have to say is not in keeping with the spirit nor the letter of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3948.069" offset="15945651">It is important to note in this case that there was clearly a subjective expectation of privacy which was reasonable.</text>

            <text syncTime="3957.876" offset="15984835">Let me ask you one question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3961.579" offset="15999673">It isn't very often that sensitive constitutional questions can be resolved by use of modern technology, but did I understand you to indicate that if a helicopter or a light plane went over and took one of these very sensitive pictures conclusively showing that it was marijuana and took that to the magistrate that a warrant could properly issue?</text>

            <text syncTime="3990.976" offset="16117224">That would be one factor which might be enough to establish probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="4000.103" offset="16153690">I mean it would depend on certainly the person taking and examining the picture whether they would have the expertise to determine from the air whether that was marijuana--</text>

            <text syncTime="4012.331" offset="16202696">The magistrate himself if you want or at least a prosecuting attorney takes the pictures, supervises them and they are unquestioned.</text>
