            <text syncTime="11.415" offset="197220">Mr. Chief Justice and, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.413" offset="209236">The District Court here imposed mandatory time limits on the processing of Social Security disability claims, Title II claims, in the State of Vermont.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.049" offset="255838">That order was based on a finding that the Secretary had violated the Social Security Act because, in the District Court's view, disability claims were not being decided quickly enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.232" offset="312576">The statute in question, which is Section 205(b) of the Social Security Act, requires that claimants be given, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="50.869" offset="355104">"reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing. "</text>
            <text syncTime="53.883" offset="367120">The statute does not contain any mandation of time limits nor does it refer to timeliness as a requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.785" offset="406722">The issue here then is what did Congress require by this broad statutory mandate?</text>
            <text syncTime="71.420" offset="437337">And, in turn, since the Secretary, under Section 205(a), has full power to issue rules, regulations, and procedures to carry out the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.323" offset="488851">The further issue is whether the Secretary acted arbitrarily and capriciously in not promulgating mandatory time limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.224" offset="528557">We urge that the critical point here is this: Both congress and the Secretary looked long and hard at whether mandatory time limits should be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.565" offset="581846">Both concluded that mandatory time limits would tend to undermine the effective operation of the Social Security disability system.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="118.603" stopTime="127.522">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="118.603" offset="626046">I take it, Mr. McGrath, you acknowledge that the Secretary has the power to issues regulations imposing such effort.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="j_paul_mc_grath" startTime="127.522" stopTime="310.826">
            <label>Mr. J. Paul Mc Grath</label>
            <text syncTime="127.522" offset="661677">Yes, we do, Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.976" offset="667528">In that context, we urge that it was totally inappropriate for the District Court to overrule the policy choice made by Congress and the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.626" offset="710160">The Social Security disability system is a very complex management problem and there are three reasons for this.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.609" offset="750075">One is that the number of claims has been rapidly expanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.027" offset="767734">There were more than two million disability claims last year.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.762" offset="782676">The second thing is that many of these claims present very difficult physical and mental and economic issues, especially since many of the claimants themselves are unable to present their claims effectively because of their very situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.660" offset="846206">And, third, and perhaps most troublesome as a management matter, the statute gives the Secretary three quite conflicting mandates.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.471" offset="889464">One is to pay claimants who are eligible as quickly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.766" offset="910676">But, secondly, given the dollars involved in the program, it is equally important that claimants not entitled to benefits not be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.930" offset="955293">And, finally, the Secretary is under an obligation to conduct the program as fairly and accurately and uniformly as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.848" offset="991029">Over the last ten years, Congress and the Secretary have wrestled with how best to manage the program given these conflicting concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.145" offset="1028227">Each of them has considered on a number of occasions the imposition of mandatory time limits and each has decided against such imposition, even though they recognized that that would undoubtedly result in faster decisions in many cases, they also recognized that it almost certainly would result in many more wrong ones.</text>
            <text syncTime="243.649" offset="1126238">First, I would like to focus on what Congress did.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.083" offset="1143897">For one thing, Congress, on a number of occasions, has amended the Social Security Act in a manner that is inconsistent with any intent to impose mandatory time limits, and I want to mention just two instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.468" offset="1201471">One is that when it established the Supplemental Security Income program, the SSI program, which is part of the Social Security system, it had put into the statute the same reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.946" offset="1271375">In addition, however, in that case, it put in a 90-day requirement for ALJ hearings, but most interestingly, it exempted from that requirement disability cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.221" offset="1320485">It is our position that the inclusion of a 90-day requirement as to the SSI program, but the exemption from that of disability claims is clear indication that when Congress intended to impose time limits, it knew how to do so and did do so--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="310.826" stopTime="316.743">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="310.826" offset="1394882">Mr. McGrath, in that connection did Congress do something about interim payments?</text>

          <turn speaker="j_paul_mc_grath" startTime="316.742" stopTime="351.011">

            <text syncTime="316.742" offset="1418601">--It has done something about interim payments in connection with the Title II program.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.460" offset="1437409">Several years ago it imposed interim payments where a claimant's disability payments are being discontinued.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.814" offset="1474816">It imposed such interim payments at the reconsideration stage and it is our position that Congress' imposition of interim benefits for that narrow class of disability claims, Title II claims, is a further indication that Congress did not intend the broad kind of interim relief imposed by the District Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="353.900" offset="1567185">That interim program actually expires, I believe, at the end of this month, but starting next year some new rules apply at the reconsideration stage including hearings, de novo type hearings that were not required prior to this time.</text>

            <text syncTime="518.320" offset="2224844">At the ALJ stage, the Court did not rely on any errors.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.616" offset="2246055">It just relied on the percentage of cases that took more than 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.052" offset="2259848">And, the problem is, as Congress has noted over and over again, many cases simply take a longer period of time to develop the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.922" offset="2295270">In many cases, perhaps the claimant has not really been able to make out a claim, but as Justice Brennan noted last year in the Campbell decision, the agency still has an obligation to try to develop the facts itself to see whether there is a valid claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.710" offset="2362457">Many times that involves additional medical or vocational or other information.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.395" offset="2385236">In Day's case itself, he had not made out a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.022" offset="2399655">It was only after a quality review proceeding with the Social Security Administration that additional neurological tests were ordered which eventually resulted in his being able to establish a claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.469" offset="2449497">That is the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.376" offset="2457125">As Congress most recently noted in 1982 in the hearing... in the congressional report that accompanied one of the bills that eventually was enacted in '82, in many cases, take a longer period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.178" offset="2524312">And the problem with mandatory time limits is that they, by their very nature, are arbitrary and do not permit the additional work in cases where that work needs to be done.</text>

            <text syncTime="612.173" offset="2600276">But, the problem with the Court's order is this: It does not recognize the dynamics of the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.669" offset="2626294">For example, the Court ordered that ALJ hearings be held within 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.275" offset="2644684">This did not take into account that many times the administrative law judge would want additional medical or vocational information.</text>

            <text syncTime="633.866" offset="2687107">He needs the help of others and frequently that takes time.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.880" offset="2699123">It did not take into account that many times the facts are difficult to come by and they are not acquired within 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.549" offset="2733814">It did not take into account the fact that the facts change.</text>
            <text syncTime="649.797" offset="2750846">We are talking about disability, on-going disability situations where the important thing is what are the facts at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.716" offset="2790447">And, many times at the administrative law judge stage those facts have changed and that may not be apparent until before the hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="678.442" offset="2865366">The problem with that is there are a whole host of other factors that could cause a delay and the Court did not take those into account.</text>

            <text syncTime="1442.970" offset="5923469">At the same time as the Court there ordered that the government impose mandatory time limits in regulations, virtually the same month, Congress, by statute, required the Secretary to submit a report as to what time limits might be appropriate and ordered the Secretary to take into account such considerations as timeliness on the one hand and the need to consider claims thoroughly on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.128" offset="6060142">The Secretary, at the same time as he was considering what to submit to Congress, was considering what to do in the Blankenship case, the Sixth Circuit case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.654" offset="6102251">The Secretary concluded in both instances to urge that time limits were not appropriate, because after the extensive rule-making process that had concluded, the Secretary concluded that the imposition of mandatory time limits would be inconsistent with the effective operation of the statute, submitted that report to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.177" offset="6192322">Congress, in 1982, did not adopt mandatory time limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.796" offset="6214787">Instead, it is clear from the committee reports that accompanied other legislation which Congress did adopt that Congress concluded that mandatory time limits would be inappropriate because... And the main thing they emphasized is that individual cases may vary greatly and that in many cases you do need additional information and mandatory time limits are arbitrary in the sense that the tend to ignore that consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.616" offset="6334114">The congressional reports also indicated, and this, I think, is perhaps even more important, that mandatory time limits can result in more incorrect determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.781" offset="6378731">And, the problem with incorrect determinations is not just that people will be paid that shouldn't be paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.873" offset="6407153">The perhaps greater problem is that people won't be paid who should be paid and that creates a severe problem, because in these cases many of the claimants really are not capable of effectively presenting their claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.929" offset="6467339">Most of them, the vast bulk of them, are not represented by counsel and the burden, however, is on them to establish their claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.629" offset="6502134">And, if they can't do it, the claim is denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1589.906" offset="6511224">If an arbitrary time limit is imposed and at that point the Secretary has to act, the claim will get denied and then the problem is they have to go to court and even though they may get a reversal in court, the statistics show that the federal courts today are taking two to three times as long as the Secretary is at the ALJ stage to hear these cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.008" offset="6611639">So that imposing mandatory time limits... I think the biggest problem with the District Court's order is that it may, in fact, result in many claims being denied that should have been granted and then many of those claimants going to court and even if they win in court, it will have taken a much longer time for them to receive benefits.</text>

            <text syncTime="1756.779" offset="7178705">As the record and results of this case show, entrenched, unnecessary delays do not need to be apart of the disability insurance appeal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.726" offset="7226562">The District Court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals in this case, engaged in the most basic of judicial functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1778.221" offset="7264491">As counsel for the Secretary admitted, the Court viewed the facts of the case and determined that disability insurance claimants in Vermont were routinely being deprived of the right to reasonably expeditious administrative appellate action that the Secretary is mandated to provide, together with other statutory goals, by 205(b) of the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.899" offset="7371175">As a consequence, the District Court, pursuant to its traditional, flexible, remedial, equitable powers fashioned a balanced, meaningful remedy that compelled expeditious processing that was within the Secretary's capacity, that did not cause extra cost to the Secretary, and that did not harm other statutory goals such as quality and accuracy in decision making.</text>

            <text syncTime="1848.288" offset="7544733">Your Honor, I think that in virtually every instance where Congress has amended the Social Security Act in recent years in the disability programs, in SSI and in disability insurance, virtually the primary factor prompting Congress' interest has been the problem of lengthy, unnecessary delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.888" offset="7647133">Virtually every action Congress has taken has been, at least in part, in the hopes of getting the Secretary to be able to deal with and eliminate this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.101" offset="7687989">Indeed, on many occasions, the Secretary has represented to Congress that the disability delay problem is well in hand and would shortly be resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.440" offset="7733337">So, I hardly think we can say that either Congress has not been interested in curing the delay problem or that Congress has been made fully aware that the Secretary does not have the capacity alone to deal with the problem.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.407" offset="7893206">As this Court noted in Fusari v.

            <text syncTime="1993.401" offset="8125174">And, indeed, there was nothing put into the record by the Secretary to show that the causes of delays elsewhere or the circumstances of delays elsewhere... What the Court found in Vermont, first of all, was that the Secretary, since January of 1978, had a goal of processing all cases within 90 days.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.956" offset="8203437">That was almost a year before this case was even filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.002" offset="8215662">The record also showed the District Court that since 1977 the Secretary was processing SSI cases and Title II cases, or it was supposed to be processing them within this 90-day goal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.417" offset="8277311">In other words, the Secretary herself provided the District Court in Vermont with an objective criterion against which the plaintiffs' allegations of unreasonable delay could be measured.</text>

            <text syncTime="3734.869" offset="15091091">The Congress was very concerned about mandatory time limits and I think that indicates what Congress meant by the reasonableness requirement under the statute and whether a court could read into the statute more of a requirement of expedition than Congress intended to put there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.440" offset="15161412">That is not to say, however, that the Secretary, in her discretion, could not conclude that time limits of some sort were appropriate, perhaps different time limits for different parts of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.498" offset="15209582">The Secretary, however, independently, operating under the authority in Section 205(a) of the statute, concluded that such time limits were not appropriate.</text>
