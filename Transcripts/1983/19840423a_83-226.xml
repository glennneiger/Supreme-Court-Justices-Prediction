            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="130641">Mr. Schafer, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. William J. Schafer, III,</label>
            <text syncTime="82.737" offset="461560">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, this case questions the propriety under the double jeopardy clause of the Arizona Supreme Court ordering a resentencing, following a life sentence that was imposed after the sentencer erroneously concluded as a matter of law that one of the statutory aggravating factors was not applicable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.625" offset="593113">Now, the facts are rather simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.743" offset="609518">Dennis Rumsey decided to rob the motorist who picked him up.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.064" offset="630834">To accomplish that, he shot him.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.366" offset="644104">Rumsey was convicted of both murder and robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.503" offset="664584">At the separate hearing to determine the sentence for murder, the State offered no new evidence to the sentencer, which by statute in Arizona is the trial judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.310" offset="719859">The State simply referred to the facts that had already been proved at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.131" offset="743160">One of the aggravating factors, the State felt had been shown by the evidence that was introduced at the trial, was that the killing had been done for pecuniary gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.022" offset="790703">Now, without deciding whether that had been shown or not, the trial judge said that that aggravating factor... pecuniary gain... applied to only a very narrow class of killers, hired killers, and it had no application to a robbery murder such as occurred here.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.804" offset="885789">The State at the initial hearing also argued two other aggravating factors, claimed that they had been shown by the evidence, but the trial judge disagreed.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.731" offset="933541">In the special verdict where the trial judge is required by statute to list his findings on each of the aggravating factors under the statute, the judge found that there were none present, and he imposed a life sentence which the statute requires where no aggravation has been shown.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.196" offset="1031343">The judge at that time also imposed a consecutive sentence for the robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.833" offset="1053913">Now, both sides appealed to the Arizona Supreme Court; Mr. Rumsey from the consecutive sentences that had been imposed, and the State from the judge's legal ruling that the pecuniary gain circumstance applied only to hired killers.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.962" offset="1122458">Mr. Schafer, may I ask right there, would the State have had the right to appeal if the defendant had not appealed?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="257.834" offset="1161955">So that, had he not appealed, we never could have reached this issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="261.903" offset="1178151">I don't below the second follows from the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.722" offset="1185465">It is conceivable, and I believe still an open question in Arizona as to whether the State could have sought a special action.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.875" offset="1214096">That has not been tested in the state court yet on this kind of a point.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.279" offset="1231754">There are... I answered your first question directly to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.731" offset="1245547">Under the appeal statute, we could not have.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.516" offset="1256623">And that was discussed in the second Rumsey opinion.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="283.385" offset="1264146">There is some other statutory method of review in Arizona by which the prosecution can get a review of the sentences?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_schafer_iii" startTime="289.103" stopTime="308.250">
            <label>Mr. William J. Schafer, III,</label>
            <text syncTime="289.103" offset="1287030">There is an action, which is called in the rules "Special Action", which permits the State or the defense, either part, to gain a hurry-up decision from the Supreme Court where it is claimed and is shown that there has been abusive discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.430" offset="1344290">And in this case, that may well have been sought, had the opportunity arisen.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="308.250" offset="1363621">And that's available in a case where there would be no appellate review otherwise.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_schafer_iii" startTime="311.635" stopTime="360.885">
            <label>Mr. William J. Schafer, III,</label>
            <text syncTime="311.635" offset="1377100">Normally it is, Your Honor, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.904" offset="1382220">It is a discretionary procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.254" offset="1387653">We, as well as Rumsey appealed, and ours was only from this one point, the legal ruling that the trial judge made that the pecuniary gain factor didn't apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.997" offset="1446585">The Supreme Court held that the trial judge did make a legal error.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.484" offset="1468528">They concluded that he erred as a matter of law in concluding that he could not decide that particular circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.340" offset="1503950">And they sent the case back to the trial court for resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.125" offset="1523072">Now, without either side offering any evidence at the resentencing, the trial judge then found that the pecuniary gain circumstance had been shown.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="360.885" stopTime="366.889">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="360.885" offset="1574168">Mr. Schafer, could the State and the defense offered evidence that there be sentencing?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_j_schafer_iii" startTime="366.889" stopTime="499.292">
            <label>Mr. William J. Schafer, III,</label>
            <text syncTime="366.889" offset="1598096">Yes, Your Honor, we could have.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.055" offset="1602798">And with that finding, the judge then set the sentence at death.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.895" offset="1634145">Rumsey's appeal was then automatic to the Arizona Supreme Court, and the Arizona Supreme Court reversed itself on the basis of Bullington v. Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.552" offset="1680747">The State sought certiorari because of its belief that Bullington is not implicated in this case, because there has been no acquittal in the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.276" offset="1731738">And I believe that's the question that this Court must decide: Was there a resolution of the factual issue against the State?</text>
            <text syncTime="410.401" offset="1772176">We contend the record shows that there was not, that there was no rejection of our position that the murder was for monetary or pecuniary gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.161" offset="1831212">The reason for the holding in Bullington was that the State of Missouri had a full and a fair opportunity to muster its forces and to present its case to the sentencer.</text>
            <text syncTime="440.837" offset="1893906">And in that case, the sentencer rejected the case of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="446.741" offset="1917521">The resolution of those factual issues against Missouri operated as an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.395" offset="1948137">Because the double jeopardy clause gives absolute finality to acquittal, Missouri could not be given another opportunity to present its case when it had failed to make its case the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.606" offset="2009054">There was no such acquittal here.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.141" offset="2027131">The trial judge did not decide the factual issue of pecuniary gain against the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.414" offset="2060254">The only thing he decided in regard to that murder was that he was not going to reach the factual issue, because it simply didn't apply in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.722" offset="2113439">Now, unlike Missouri's appeal--</text>

            <text syncTime="540.203" offset="2291385">I do at a further point in the brief, I believe, Your Honor, which is page 66 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.155" offset="2311239">Now, specifically, what I'm referring to in the brief... and I pointed it out perhaps in a footnote in the brief... is that in regard to the robbery, the trial judge made what I considered a finding as to pecuniary gain, a finding that the robbery and the murder were actually one act.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.138" offset="2411131">The same force was used to accomplish both.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.340" offset="2423983">And if you read what the trial judge did at 66, and especially... page 66 of the Joint Appendix... if you combine it with other things that were before the trial judge, I believe the conclusion is inescapable that in his mind he had concluded that the murder was for pecuniary gain, that the case of the murder was the robbery, which our Supreme Court has defined under the murder statute as the definition of pecuniary gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.025" offset="2550729">Now, a little earlier when I spoke, I... I believe made the statement that the trial judge did not make a factual determination in regard to the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.750" offset="2597541">I tried to be clear in the brief to show that his conclusion was really stated when he was sentencing for the robbery and not for the murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="626.023" offset="2634634">My point is that I believe the entire record shows that there was no question in his mind that he believed, if he could have considered that circumstance, that the murder was for pecuniary gain.</text>

            <text syncTime="639.615" offset="2689074">Mr. Schafer, what do you... how do you distinguish the language of this Court in United States v. Scott when it said that the fact that the acquittal in a criminal case may result from an erroneous evidentiary ruling or erroneous interpretation of governing legal principals affects the accuracy of the determination, but it doesn't alter its character?</text>
            <text syncTime="671.003" offset="2814566">In other words, even though an acquittal might be based on an erroneous interpretation of law, it's binding for double jeopardy purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="681.275" offset="2855735">Now, to the extent that the death sentencing curing is given similar characteristics, how do you distinguish that?</text>

            <text syncTime="697.571" offset="2920832">In Scott and other cases from this Court, there was an actual acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.206" offset="2939431">There was nothing in this case that terminated the proceedings against the State, as this Court said last week in Lydon.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.295" offset="2967748">There was nothing to show there but termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.629" offset="2973077">The only thing that could approach being an acquittal here was the trial judge's statement that</text>

            <text syncTime="719.234" offset="3007559">although I am paraphrasing, of course.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.650" offset="3013201">And he went ahead, then, and finished with the sentencing, as he is required to do by statute, without even getting to that aggravating factor.</text>

            <text syncTime="880.036" offset="3650693">There is no acquittal in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.736" offset="3657485">There is no acquittal as there would be in the hypothetical you've asked me.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.255" offset="3671591">There is a decision by the trial judge to avoid any termination of proceedings on this particular point on pecuniary damage.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.963" offset="3710461">Unlike Missouri's appeal, the State's appeal here and the relief given by the Arizona Supreme Court did not involve the State proving its case all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.722" offset="3777439">In Bullington, Missouri said it was going to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.709" offset="3797397">That's exactly what it said: We are going to prove the case that we presented before.</text>
            <text syncTime="919.494" offset="3808577">But Arizona did not have to represent its case.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.248" offset="3831565">The facts of its case had already been presented and proved at the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.552" offset="3856747">What Arizona asked for in its appeal was to correct the error that had been made, and in that sense it was much like the appeal the government took in the DiFrancesco case.</text>
            <text syncTime="945.895" offset="3914217">That appeal was to correct an error by the sentencer, and that appeal was upon the record that was made in the sentencing court.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.501" offset="3952564">That's the same thing that was done here by the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.905" offset="3970223">If the controlling consideration behind the double jeopardy clause where there is an acquittal, is to prevent the government oppression that would come with repeated efforts to convict and to make up its deficiencies in the State's case with each new effort of reprosecution, then applying the double jeopardy clause here would not accomplish that.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.007" offset="4086625">Once jeopardy attaches, before a defendant can claim that there has been a second jeopardy to which he has been put, he just show that the first jeopardy was terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1007.052" offset="4158827">But it was not terminated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.004" offset="4170634">And I believe, absent that, Bullington really does not apply to this fact situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1016.825" offset="4197906">If my argument has been unpersuasive, if the Court feels that Bullington must be applied to this case, then I urge the Court to reconsider its holding in Bullington.</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.453" offset="4272408">In DiFrancesco, this Court recognized that, historically, double jeopardy principals had not been applied to sentencing proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.594" offset="4320995">There is a fundamental difference, said the Court, between the two procedures that required that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.033" offset="4354745">And we have the Pearce, Chaffin, and the Stroud decisions that recognize that distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.572" offset="4388914">And Stroud involved a death sentence after a life sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.142" offset="4411170">Bullington did not overrule Stroud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.411" offset="4428202">It was felt that there was no need to overrule Stroud, that what distinguished the two cases were the number of trial protections given in Bullington that were not present in Stroud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.706" offset="4489433">The effect of that recognition is that the more trial attributes a state builds into its sentencing procedure, the more likely it is to lose the ability to eliminate aberrant sentences like that given to Dennis Rumsey.</text>
            <text syncTime="1110.953" offset="4574383">Since 1972 and the Furman case, we, the states who have death penalties, have been doing what we can to eliminate aberrant death sentences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.046" offset="4638749">Bullington, I believe, impedes that progress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.867" offset="4658079">If a state today were to draft a new death penalty statute, and it wanted to do the most that it could to produce an informed and a rational final sentence, it would want to retain some kind of review flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="1156.082" offset="4754941">The only way that it could cope with Bullington in that regard would be to write into its procedures as few trial attributes as possible to take it away from the holding in Bullington, and perhaps return it to a case like DiFrancesco or Stroud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1178.848" offset="4845952">And that would not be the signal that should be sent to such a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.417" offset="4868208">Our argument is that Bullington does not apply because there has been no final termination factually against the State's point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.392" offset="4916169">And with that, I would like to reserve the rest of my time for rebuttal.</text>

            <text syncTime="1230.280" offset="5051692">After the sentencing hearing before the trial court in this matter, a hearing which amounts to a trial, there was a final verdict of acquittal as to those facts which were at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.658" offset="5121178">On his appeal, on his direct appeal, respondent won nothing.</text>

            <text syncTime="1263.268" offset="5183663">There is no justification under the double jeopardy clause for reviewing respondent's acquittal at that sentencing trial and allowing the State to retry those factual issues which were already resolved against it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1307.879" offset="5362132">Well, first of all, of course, Bullington essentially states that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.331" offset="5379895">In Bullington, when the defendant was sentenced to life, this Court stated that that was an acquittal as to the death penalty.</text>

            <text syncTime="1328.626" offset="5445097">The Court made the finding... and I think this is important, Your Honor... the Court made the finding that the defendant did not commit this offense in consideration for the receipt or in expectation of the receipt of anything of pecuniary value.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.123" offset="5527121">That, to respondent, Your Honor, seems to be about as direct as an acquittal... an acquittal as there can be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.110" offset="5558990">At the sentencing hearing or trial following his conviction for first degree murder, Dennis Wayne Rumsey was put in jeopardy of his life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.620" offset="5609041">Depending on the factual determinations made by the trial court, he would either be subject to the death penalty or not subject to it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.409" offset="5652195">Either he would be guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of whatever is necessary to receive the death penalty, or he would be not guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.332" offset="5687931">In its special verdict, the trial court announced, as required by Arizona law, its factual findings as to each individual aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.270" offset="5723666">The Court found that no aggravating circumstance had been proven, and specifically found, as I just mentioned, that the offense was not committed for pecuniary gain as described by the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.148" offset="6303167">And I need to answer your questions and finish the Chief Justice's answer at the same time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.969" offset="6334514">As far as finding it is an aggravating circumstance for the robbery, as I pointed out in my brief, Your Honor, he found that as an aggravating circumstance under the subsection that permits finding anything that is appropriate as an aggravating circumstance for a non-capital crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.215" offset="6419464">He did not find that as an aggravating circumstance under the statute which provides that the crime was committed for pecuniary gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.321" offset="6447885">That leads me to the second part of my answer to the Chief Justice's question, which is the judge at trial interpreted the statute, and I think subsections 4 and 5 are read together by him.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.366" offset="6516012">He interpreted the statute which uses that pecuniary gain language as meaning a murder for hire.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.972" offset="6550494">And again, as I pointed out in my brief, this is not some sort of off-the-wall interpretation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1689.542" offset="6888728">On direct appeal or on the State's cross-appeal, the State sought review of the trial court's failure to find the pecuniary gain aggravating circumstance, Respondent did not prevail, obviously, on appeal the first time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.658" offset="6985172">The State did prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.574" offset="6988933">And as a result, the State was allowed to conduct a new presentence hearing at the which the State attempted once again to prove several aggravating circumstances to the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.535" offset="7056747">An entirely new special verdict was issued in which the trial court, essentially citing the Arizona Supreme Court's first opinion in this matter, found that the pecuniary gain aggravating circumstance existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.645" offset="7117142">In essence, the chronology of this case, as far as the sentencing is concerned, was this: Respondent was acquitted of those things necessary for the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.769" offset="7169701">The State appealed from that acquittal, and respondent was retried and then convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.875" offset="7198122">This is a clear violation of the guarantees of the double jeopardy clause, whether analyzed in terms of traditional double jeopardy law or in terms of the particular application of the double jeopardy clause described in Bullington v. Missouri.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.802" offset="7265831">Upon his conviction for first degree murder alone, respondent could not be given the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.145" offset="7315150">Without more, life was the only possible sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.667" offset="7349214">Before the death penalty could be imposed, the State was required at the presentence hearing to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the existence of one or more aggravating factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.308" offset="7399787">The trial judge's conclusion in his special verdict that none of those aggravating factors existed represented a resolution in respondent's favor, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements charged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.853" offset="7473975">Thus, as this Court has stated more than once, there was an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.090" offset="7494977">As this Court has stated repeatedly since 1896, one of the most fundamental rules of double jeopardy jurisprudence is that a verdict of acquittal may not be reviewed without putting the defendant twice in jeopardy.</text>

            <text syncTime="1897.825" offset="7721929">First of all, one that is significant is that in DiFrancesco, there is a statute that particularly provided for appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1907.081" offset="7758919">No. 2, the burden of proof in DiFrancesco was not the burden beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1946.256" offset="7915653">In any event, DiFrancesco is distinguishable from the present case, for several different reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.180" offset="7955359">First of all, the burden of proof in DiFrancesco was not beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1963.168" offset="7983258">I believe it's by preponderance of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.786" offset="7989737">Secondly, the choice of sentencing, the range of sentence that was provided to the sentencer was quite large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1977.427" offset="8040310">As I believe was the case in DiFrancesco, the effect of the sentence that he received for being a dangerous special offender was an additional year beyond the sentence that he was already serving.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.466" offset="8084404">And given the possibility of making concurrent sentences as they were in DiFrancesco, presumably the sentence could have been zero, a range from zero, I believe, to 25 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.924" offset="8130275">In this case, there is no such range of sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.876" offset="8146053">It is one or the other, life or death, just as it would be guilty or innocent at a trial on the question of guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.982" offset="8186491">Beyond that, in DiFrancesco, the defendant was found to be a dangerous special offender.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.372" offset="8236123">And the appeal that the government took was essentially an appeal from the length of the sentence that was imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2034.061" offset="8266843">In this case, when... in this case, Mr. Rumsey was not found to be guilty of those things, the aggravating circumstances, which would allow the imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.404" offset="8328179">So that, I believe, too, is a significant distinguishing characteristic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.557" offset="8352839">As this Court has said, the law attaches a particular significance to an acquittal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.282" offset="8399754">An acquittal absolutely shields the defendant from a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.019" offset="8426713">To permit a second trial after an acquittal, however mistaken, would present an unacceptably high risk, as this Court has stated, that the innocent may ultimately be found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.164" offset="8495258">These considerations all apply directly to the case before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.967" offset="8518455">In addition to those general double jeopardy considerations, the particular considerations, the particular analysis that was presented by this Court in the Bullington v. Missouri decision applies to this case as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.061" offset="8582821">The sentencing here, as the sentencing in Bullington, was not a traditional sentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.119" offset="8623049">It was not merely a decision by the sentencer, in his discretion meting out what he felt justice required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.141" offset="8659203">The sentencer here, as in Bullington, had the choice of life or death, essentially guilty or not guilty of those things that could result in the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.417" offset="8724300">There are specific standards that are provided to the sentencer in determining whether the sentence of death may be imposed or, in Arizona, must be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.279" offset="8787725">And finally, the burden of proof regarding those aggravating circumstances is on the State, a burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.420" offset="8836313">So under traditional notions of double jeopardy law, as well as this Court's holding in Bullington v. Missouri, the State should not have been allowed to retry the respondent a second time on the issue of whether his first degree murder was a first degree murder with aggravating circumstances subject to the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.167" offset="8919278">Petitioner argues that the Arizona sentencing procedure does not resemble a trial sufficiently to call the double jeopardy clause into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="2208.106" offset="8963059">Obviously, respondent disagrees with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2211.927" offset="8978314">There are certain objective factual issues which must be resolved at the Arizona sentencing hearing, just as there are at a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.365" offset="9020006">The State must carry the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt as to those factual issues, just as at a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.519" offset="9044665">If the State prevails at the hearing, the authorized punishment of death must be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2235.125" offset="9071101">If the State does not prevail, the authorized punishment cannot be imposed, just as at a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.696" offset="9097328">At the Arizona sentencing hearing, it is truly an issue of guilty or not guilty of those things for which the penalty of death is authorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.385" offset="9140169">Petitioner recites in his brief a litany of minor differences between the Arizona and Missouri capital sentencing procedures, in the hope of convincing the Court that the double jeopardy clause does not apply in the present case, as it does in Bullington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.013" offset="9202654">In fact, those differences that do exist either are insignificant to the double jeopardy issue or they make Arizona's procedure even more like a trial than is Missouri's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.571" offset="9252914">First of all, the fact that a judge is a fact finder in Arizona makes no difference, as double jeopardy law does not discriminate between bench and jury trials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2291.795" offset="9297740">Contrary to petitioner's assertion, Arizona procedure does not provide... does provide for an argument to the court... essentially a closing argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.436" offset="9344342">Third, the fact that the rules of evidence do not apply to mitigation in Arizona is not significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.071" offset="9366912">What is significant is that the rules of evidence apply to aggravating circumstances, those things which must be proven in order to result in the imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.546" offset="9412783">This implies that the risk of error at that hearing is on the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.135" offset="9447160">Another distinction that petitioner has set forth is that aggravating circumstances that are found in Missouri must separately be found to be sufficient to... for the imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.898" offset="9530230">The fact that this is not the case in Arizona, this separate proof of sufficiency for imposition of the death penalty, really does not make Arizona's procedure less like a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.356" offset="9575996">At a regular trial, the State does not have to prove, once it's proven the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, does not have to prove separately that they are sufficient for a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2374.081" offset="9626883">Once they are proven, that results in conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.651" offset="9641198">Finally, the fact that Arizona's procedure does not allow the Court to exercise compassion and sentence a defendant to life, even though the State has proven its case, makes the Arizona procedure more like a trial than Missouri's.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.212" offset="9715385">Never at a trial on guilt or innocence is the jury ever instructed that even though they find the State has proven their case beyond a reasonable doubt, that they can still acquit the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2406.920" offset="9758226">The petitioner also attempts to fit the present case into the mold of United States v. DiFrancesco, rather than the mold of Bullington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.526" offset="9800649">All the similarities that this case shares with DiFrancesco are also shared with Bullington, and mean nothing with regard to the double jeopardy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.632" offset="9837116">I've already recited in my answer to Justice Rehnquist the differences between the Arizona proceeding and the proceeding in DiFrancesco which are significant to this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.474" offset="9896466">Petitioner argues that the Arizona sentencing procedure is not the final step.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.032" offset="9942755">This, of course, is true only when the death penalty is imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.417" offset="9964280">It is not true when a life sentence is imposed, as was made abundantly clear in the Arizona Supreme Court's second Rumsey opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2467.792" offset="10001792">I believe this touches on a question that was asked by Justice Stevens of petitioner regarding... well, which was answered by petitioner by referring to the Arizona procedures known as "Special Action" to the Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.420" offset="10080264">Petitioner has stated that this is an open question in Arizona as to whether the State could have proceeded by means of special action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.442" offset="10116313">I would submit to this Court that, given the fact that the double jeopardy clause is called into play, it does not matter whether the special action law could be used or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.921" offset="10182246">It could not, under double jeopardy considerations, be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2517.856" offset="10201994">Petitioner also has argued that the Arizona death sentencing procedure is no different from the procedure for imposing a sentence less than death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.782" offset="10257688">In fact, respondent would submit that from beginning to end, the procedures are totally different.</text>
            <text syncTime="2540.555" offset="10292796">There is notice required of aggravating circumstances in a death penalty proceeding, but in a non-death penalty sentencing proceeding there is no notice required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2551.379" offset="10336055">In death proceedings, there is a required hearing that must take place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2558.867" offset="10366043">In non-death penalty proceedings, there is no required hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2563.501" offset="10384643">The Court can impose an aggravated sentence in Arizona on a non-death penalty case without holding any hearing at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.988" offset="10410556">The burden of proof on the State is on the State at a death penalty sentencing proceeding in Arizona to prove beyond a reasonable doubt those aggravating factors which would justify the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.302" offset="10487774">With non-death penalty sentencing procedures, there is no burden on the State to prove anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2595.223" offset="10511493">The Court can merely find the aggravating circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.139" offset="10523196">There is no proof beyond a reasonable doubt requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2601.674" offset="10537302">The choice at sentencings other than death penalty sentencings in Arizona is not a choice between life and death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.280" offset="10579725">It's a broad choice, a broad range of sentences from which the sentencer can select.</text>
            <text syncTime="2617.601" offset="10601041">The aggravating factors in a death penalty sentencing proceeding are limited to those set forth in the statute, but in a non-death penalty sentencing proceeding, they can include anything that the Court deems to be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.860" offset="10654017">Finally, in a death penalty sentencing proceeding, a special verdict is required at which the sentencing judge must set forth his findings as to each and every aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.918" offset="10706262">This, of course, is not required in a non-death penalty sentencing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="2647.803" offset="10721831">Petitioner states that if the Arizona procedure does amount to a trial, then the State of Arizona proved its case at the first hearing and that the judge found that the State proved its case, but refused to find it to be an aggravating circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.366" offset="10800094">Respondent, again, disagrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.151" offset="10811170">The Court specifically found that the State did not prove its case; that the facts... the facts proven did not constitute the conduct prescribed by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2683.745" offset="10865609">Petitioner further claims that the State's appeal herein was the same as an appeal from an erroneous directed verdict after a guilty verdict, which would merely require reinstatement of the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.969" offset="10922452">Well, respondent is at a loss as to which verdict is to be reinstated: the verdict which stated that the defendant did not commit the offense, in the expectation as consideration for the receipt or in expectation of the receipt of anything of pecuniary value; or the verdict which said there are no aggravating circumstances; or the verdict which said the defendant shall be sentenced to life rather than death.</text>
            <text syncTime="2735.178" offset="11071350">Clearly, the analogy does not hold up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.313" offset="11087859">There is no verdict to be reinstated, no verdict in favor of the State that can be reinstated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.348" offset="11108025">The only verdict is a verdict in favor of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.334" offset="11127879">Petitioner has asked this Court to, if all else fails, reconsider the Bullington rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.976" offset="11174481">Respondent would submit that that is not appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.230" offset="11203529">It is particularly not appropriate in this case, which respondent believes presents a much stronger double jeopardy case than even Bullington did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2777.688" offset="11241354">In any event, respondent submits that Bullington does not blur the distinctions between trials and sentencings, as petitioner has argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="2792.245" offset="11299555">There is a clear line drawn in Bullington.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.530" offset="11312721">Bullington says that when the sentencing... when the factual findings that lead up to that sentencing constitute a trial, when there are particular facts that must be proven by the State in order to reach the determination that the death penalty is to be imposed, and when those factors must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, when there is a choice between only two alternatives, then you don't have a sentencing, you don't have the mere imposition of a sentence, you have a trial, you have a factual determination by the finder of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2847.463" offset="11520447">Petitioner made a very noteworthy comment in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2858.438" offset="11564332">In attempting to distinguish this sentencing procedure from a trial, petitioner stated that the reason the rules of evidence apply to aggravating circumstances and the reason those circumstances must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt is to... and I quote...</text>
            <text syncTime="2876.332" offset="11635908">"require more credibility and reliability of the facts upon which the death sentence may rest. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2881.986" offset="11658582">No doubt this last statement that I quoted from petitioner's brief is true.</text>
            <text syncTime="2887.957" offset="11682406">The intent here was to require more credibility and more reliability of the facts upon which the death penalty may rest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2897.229" offset="11719500">This, respondent would submit to the Court, is why the Arizona sentencing procedure resembles a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2906.169" offset="11755235">These are the same things that are required at a trial, because the determination has been made that society, the State, will impose upon itself almost the entire risk of error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.213" offset="11823467">This certainly must even be more true when the death penalty is the final verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.736" offset="11865577">When the verdict of guilty is the death penalty, it must be more true than in any other criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.044" offset="11910716">The double jeopardy clause, therefore, must be applied to this case and it absolutely shields the respondent from the retrial which resulted in the imposition of the death penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.803" offset="11965782">Thank you.</text>
