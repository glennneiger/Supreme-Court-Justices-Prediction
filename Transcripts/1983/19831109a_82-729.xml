            <label>Mr. Elliott Schulder</label>
            <text syncTime="47.212" offset="337252">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.729" offset="343312">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the basic question in this case is whether a statute that prohibits a publisher from printing an illustration of U.S. currency in color rather than in black and white, or in dimensions approximating the size of genuine currency, violates the First Amendment protection of freedom of speech or of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.125" offset="436935">There are two statutes at issue in this case, and they must be viewed in tandem.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.715" offset="455221">The first one, 18 USC 474, Paragraph 6, prohibits the printing, photographing, or otherwise making or executing any engraving, photograph, print, or impression in the likeness of any obligation or security of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.286" offset="533484">The term</text>
            <text syncTime="98.345" offset="541739">"obligation or security of the United States. "</text>
            <text syncTime="101.437" offset="554173">is also defined by statute in 18 USC 8, which we have reproduced on Page 5 of our brief, Footnote 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.262" offset="589386">The second statute involved in this case is 18 USC 504.1.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.654" offset="614986">That statute creates an exception to the ban in Section 474.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.900" offset="644034">Section 504 permits the printing or publishing of illustrations of U. S. securities and obligations for philatelic, numismatic, educational, historical, or newsworthy purposes in articles, books, journals, newspapers, or albums, provided that three conditions are met.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.360" offset="725850">First, the illustrations must be in black and white.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.528" offset="742463">Second, the illustrations must be either over or undersized.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.951" offset="760227">In other words, they must be at least one and a half times the size or less than three-quarters the size of actual currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.307" offset="793663">And three, the materials, the negatives and the plates used in the making of these illustrations, must be destroyed after their final use.</text>
            <text syncTime="170.912" offset="832011">This case began when appellee Time, Incorporated, brought suit for declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.984" offset="888331">Time claimed that the statutory scheme amounted to government censorship of the press, and effected a massive infringement of the First Amendment rights of Time's editors and publishers.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.243" offset="941308">The basis for the lawsuit was that over approximately a ten-year period Secret Service agents had brought to the attention of Time's management the fact that a number of illustrations of currency in Time's magazines violated the color and size requirements of the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.034" offset="1016540">The district court entered summary judgment for Time and held Sections 474, Paragraph 6, and 504.1 unconstitutional on their face and as applied to Time.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.169" offset="1077040">The district court concluded that Section 474, Paragraph 6, was overbroad because it prohibits all reproductions of currency without regard to whether the reproduction has a capacity to deceive.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.287" offset="1137539">Turning to Section 504.1, the court focused on the purpose and forum provisions of the statute, and held that the statute is an impermissible regulation of the manner of depicting currency because, first of all, it is a content based statute that requires an inquiry into whether an illustration is undertaken or produced for one of the purposes specified in the statute, and two, the court concluded that there was no nexus between the statutory goal of preventing counterfeiting and the newsworthiness or educational value of an illustration or the type of forum in which the illustration appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.579" offset="1322695">The court also held Section 504 void for vagueness, because it concluded that it is difficult to determine what is a philatelic, numismatic, educational, historical, or newsworthy purpose, and what is a journal, newspaper, or album.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.231" offset="1393330">The government's basic submission in this case is that the statutory scheme at issue here serves what is a concededly compelling governmental interest in a manner that does not impose a substantial burden on First Amendment rights, and that leaves open ample alternative channels of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.923" offset="1500119">First of all, the interest, government interest in this case is that of protecting against counterfeiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.542" offset="1530526">This is an interest that has a specific constitutional authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.511" offset="1550483">Congress enacted a counterfeiting statute, the first Congress enacted a counterfeiting statute in reliance upon the explicit authority of the Constitution to coin money and protect against counterfeiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.191" offset="1613177">Time recognizes in this case that it is essential to its facial challenge to attempt to portray the case as involving a substantial infringement of First Amendment interests, but Time has grossly overstated the impact of the statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.400" offset="1689977">Time's brief contains numerous examples of hyperbolic rhetoric.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.134" offset="1716935">For example, Time states that the law purports to control the editorial content of Time's magazines, and that the statute prohibits, prevents, or suppresses the use of the symbol of money.</text>

            <label>Mr. Elliott Schulder</label>
            <text syncTime="433.333" offset="1881716">The problem with Time's exaggerated portrayal of its First Amendment interest in this case is that Time's editors and publishers in fact may use pictures of currency symbolically.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.907" offset="1952037">The statutory scheme does not prohibit such use.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.873" offset="1967920">The statutes merely impose reasonable restrictions on the manner in which a person may print or photograph U.S. currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.308" offset="2001670">Thus, Time's argument really is that it has a substantial First Amendment in publishing pictures of currency in color, or in a size approximating the size of actual currency.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.004" offset="2056423">It is our contention that this position trivializes the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.406" offset="2082023">While Time may have legitimate reasons for printing color pictures of currency or pictures that approximate the size of genuine currency, we submit that it demeans the Constitution to say that there is a substantial First Amendment interest to publish pictures of currency in color rather than in black and white.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="504.042" offset="2164570">Mr. Schulder, I guess there is more involved here than simply the size and color limitation, though.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.586" offset="2190692">If you look at Section 504, you still have the restrictions on the purpose of the publication, do you not, to contend with?</text>
            <text syncTime="525.970" offset="2252237">And the government in its brief has apparently conceded that at least some aspects of that might be invalid, and it is suggested we should narrow the construction of the statute or something.</text>

            <text syncTime="552.553" offset="2358607">First of all, Your Honor, I would like to point out that in none of the instances that are involved in this case did the Secret Service agents question in any way whether Time, any of Time's publications were journals, newspapers, articles, or books, or in any way suggested that the use of the pictures here was not for a newsworthy or other purpose covered in the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="585.632" offset="2490891">Focusing on the statute itself, and in order to understand the statute, it is also important to understand the legislative history behind it.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.942" offset="2532165">The statute, as you can see, on Pages 2 and 3 of the government's opening brief, provides that certain pictures of currency are permitted for a list of enumerated purposes in a list of enumerated forums, but not for advertising purposes, et cetera, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.116" offset="2636863">And then the statute sets out the specific conditions under which these illustrations may be published or printed.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.956" offset="2672181">Now, it is our... if you look at the legislative history, it seems clear that what Congress was getting at here was, Congress was attempting to carve out an exception to the broad prohibition on the use of currency for expressive purposes that was established in Section 474.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.792" offset="2771551">Congress was aware of the fact that over the years the Secretary of the Treasury had created administrative exceptions to the broad ban in 474, and in fact had permitted the use of illustrations of currency for certain of these purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.846" offset="2843753">Congress essentially codified this administrative practice in the statute, but we submit that Congress did not intend in enacting this statute to require Secret Service agents to pore over every single publication that might contain an illustration of currency in order to determine whether--</text>

            <text syncTime="3269.931" offset="13228158">Our first instance with the enforcement of the statute was in 1965, when we wanted to present the Fowler cover, which is attached to the Schwartz affidavit.</text>

            <text syncTime="3289.109" offset="13304854">So in 1958, I am not sure, at least from Time's point of view, that someone had sat down and really had the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3295.372" offset="13329827">It wasn't brought home until we decided to make use of the symbol, and then found that the Secret Service was at our door with varying interpretations, and many interpretations that would stop us from publishing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.772" offset="13387505">Indeed, one thing to keep in mind is that the Secret Service has interpreted this statute in its narrowest form whenever it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.615" offset="13426898">It has taken the... It has tried to close whatever it could to prevent things from being published, right down to when they at one point insisted that the representation of the dollar... of the currency had to relate directly to your story.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.014" offset="13488442">Your story had to be about that particular representation of currency to qualify under the purpose, and the Lockheed cover as an example, where we were told that that was one problem there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.666" offset="13527103">Now, I realize that after this lawsuit was brought, and in this Court the Treasury Department and Secret Service have now withdrawn that interpretation, but if you consider the way the current statute has been interpreted by the enforcement agency, that also should raise some concern.</text>

            <label>Mr. Elliott Schulder</label>
            <text syncTime="3587.456" offset="14498232">First of all, Time tells us that Congress was in effect foolish to think that the statutory restrictions in this case would be affected, but we submit that that is really not something that this Court should quickly second guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.060" offset="14556641">For example, Mr. Gold said that he would be very suspicious it be were handed a thousand dollar bill with a portrait of Grant or Franklin on it, but he himself wasn't sure whose portrait was on the bill, and it is clear that Congress was properly or could properly have been concerned with people not as astute as counsel in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.847" offset="14643786">Mr. Gold has also suggested several alternative ways that the statute could be written, but I believe that there would be problems with each of those.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.938" offset="14684119">The first suggestion is that Congress could prohibit a duplicate or exact copy of a bill or plate or negative, but what is an exact copy?</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.493" offset="14738349">A publisher could produce a copy that is only one and a half percent larger than the real thing, and most people would be fooled, especially when we are talking about all of the securities and obligations of the United States, including bonds, which most people have never seen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3679.840" offset="14867708">It conceivably could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.386" offset="14877948">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.121" offset="14884844">We also... The other alternative would be to insert an intent element, but as we pointed out in our main brief in this case, an intent requirement would make the statute meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3696.413" offset="14934059">Time could publish an exact duplicate illustration of currency with the perfectly innocent intent of providing news and exercising its First Amendment rights, and yet people could then take that illustration and possibly pass it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.872" offset="15007828">We can't expect all publishers to be as responsible as Time, and so we submit that Congress clearly had these factors in mind when it enacted the statute.</text>
