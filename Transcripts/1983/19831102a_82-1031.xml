            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="153212">We will hear arguments next in Jefferson Parish Hospital District v. Hyde.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.427" offset="190828">Mr. Easterbrook, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="12.639" offset="203681">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.541" offset="215279">The question in this case is whether an arrangement by which a hospital obtains full-time services of four anesthesiologists in exchange for a promise not to admit others to practice there is a tying unlawful per se under the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.962" offset="284974">The first contract was signed in 1971 when East Jefferson General Hospital opened.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.198" offset="313917">Dr. Roux pledged to work full time in the hospital for a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.750" offset="332203">The hospital pledged to give him all of the hospital business.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.462" offset="347041">The contract also called for Dr. Roux to hire, fire, supervise and train the nurse anesthetists at the hospital and to run the hospital's department of anesthesia.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.062" offset="397405">The contract was extended year by year until 1976 when a new five-year agreement was signed.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.428" offset="426871">By the time of trial Roux and Associations, four anesthesiologists, were supervising 14 operating rooms.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.784" offset="460308">Respondent attacked this arrangement as a tying because a patient could not use the hospital's operating rooms without taking one of the hospital's anesthesiologists.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.129" offset="505656">After a trial the District Court held for the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.163" offset="521852">The Court concluded that the hospital faced competition from many other local hospitals and could not charge a monopoly premium for its services without driving patients away plus it found no market power or any other source of dominance, and it held that under the rule of reason the contract is pro-competitive, beneficial and lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.689" offset="615893">The Fifth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.581" offset="627491">It found that operating rooms and anesthesia are separate products, and then it concluded that although the market is not concentrated and although under traditional standards of market power... There would be none in this case... the arrangement nonetheless was unlawful per se because of generic imperfections in the market for medical services.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.287" offset="718293">The Court of Appeals observed that many patients are insured.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.532" offset="731250">Many patients would like to use hospitals near their home and that there is a lack of perfect information in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.414" offset="758835">Consequently according to the Court of Appeals the hospital had market power and the per se rule against tyings applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.560" offset="787361">When the Court turned to the hospital's arguments about pro-competitive benefits from this arrangement, the Court of Appeals simply observed that because the per se rule had been invoked these benefits could be considered only if this contract was the least restrictive alternative to arrange them, and the Court held that it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.003" offset="869176">The arguments we make in our brief about this subject really boil down to three: no tie, no market power and no enhancement of market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.580" offset="919436">I would like to take them up in that order.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.104" offset="929571">Our basic proposition is that an arrangement such as this is best analyzed as an exclusive dealing or employment contract and not as a tying.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.821" offset="968441">To understand this you can think of a continuum by which hospital services can be arranged.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.556" offset="995400">At one end of that continuum is the perfectly open hospital in which all qualified professionals may practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.411" offset="1022776">If 8 anesthesiologists or 14 anesthesiologists want to practice in East Jefferson General Hospital they may do so, and if there are more anesthesiologists who want to work there and there is work to be had they will all work part time.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.500" offset="1079201">That clearly would be lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.921" offset="1088814">Many hospitals are operated in exactly that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.003" offset="1101143">At the other end is group practice of medicine similar to the group health association here in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.099" offset="1129565">Such a group practice is closed on all sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.750" offset="1144193">All physicians are under full-time contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.942" offset="1156941">All medical services are sold as a package.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.035" offset="1169271">One cannot get the podiatrist of the group health association without taking its dermatologist, its internal medicine man and its radiologist.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.350" offset="1198528">The only choice a patient has when medicine is practiced as a group is to go with that group or to seek medical care elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.524" offset="1231233">That, too, would be lawful we should think.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.126" offset="1249623">The Court indicated as much in Maricopa.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.818" offset="1260386">That is a plain partnership in which people cooperate to produce a product.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.686" offset="1307929">This hospital is organized in both of those ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="291.858" offset="1320572">Some of the departments at this hospital are organized like the closed panel practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.303" offset="1342410">The anesthesiology department is so organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.654" offset="1351814">Radiology is so organized.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.884" offset="1356725">Cardiology, nursing services and many other services this hospital provides are organized in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.659" offset="1383788">Other services that this hospital provides like internal medicine are organized in the first way, a way in which each physician can participate in any particular case.</text>

            <text syncTime="369.720" offset="1632056">I think there would be a problem if the dentists or if this association did anything which had the effect of excluding others from setting up competing organizations, but if all you see is that one organization whether it be a very large supermarket or whether it be a very large medical organization provides the services in one town that seems not troublesome so long as it does not exclude competition by others.</text>

There was one health maintenance organization of two internal medicine specialists, one cardiologist and so on... that the fact that there was just one group practice of medicine in say Charlottesville, Virginia would not make that group practice of medicine unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="506.099" offset="2177597">They were behaving exactly as partners in a business venture, and similarly the physicians who get together in a hospital together with the nurses and others are participating in one business venture which competes against other business ventures.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.788" offset="2232350">It is true that they participate as partners, charge a price and each of them takes his share of that income.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.942" offset="2264951">But that is exactly the same way a large law firm practices that one cannot get a part-time job, for example, at a large law firm in the District of Columbia and work part-time at another law firm in the District of Columbia.</text>

            <text syncTime="1146.207" offset="4738015">Second argument that there is no market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.460" offset="4747001">As Fortner said it is possible to have cheap credit and sell expensive houses, and that is not a question of market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.653" offset="4775736">What you would look for the Court said in Fortner is some elevation of the package price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1161.427" offset="4798828">It is undisputed in this record that no one at trial testified that this arrangement raised the package price of operating rooms and anesthesiology.</text>
            <text syncTime="1171.034" offset="4837281">The executive director of the hospital testified to the contrary that this had reduced the package price and there was no contrary evidence of any sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.863" offset="4880644">Nor did the Court of Appeals suggest that this had raised the package price of the anesthesiology-operating room package.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.436" offset="4906871">So we suggest that under the first and most narrow interpretation of Fortner II there is no market power in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.041" offset="4937277">The second reason why we have argued that there is no market power in this case is because the market is properly characterized as one of anesthesia services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1205.816" offset="4976461">The hospital is acquiring anesthesia services to put into this package of surgery and medical care by looking throughout the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.642" offset="5011779">The anesthesiologists who have ended up in New Orleans came in one case from Minnesota and another case from Florida and another case from California, and it again is undisputed in this record that there is nationwide movement of anesthesiologists.</text>
            <text syncTime="1231.014" offset="5077189">That means that both for what the hospital is doing the hospital can turn to the nation as a whole to hire its employees or acquire its exclusive contracts and similarly the anesthesiologists can turn to the nation as a whole, that is, those who believe the competitive opportunities in New Orleans are not what they might be, can easily go to Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1251.667" offset="5159841">As Dr. Adriani, Respondent's specialist expert, testified in this case anesthesiologists are like nomads, and they are like nomads precisely because they lack patient contact, that they are brought into a case by a surgeon as part of the hospital's package rather than on the basis of individual contacts with patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.141" offset="5249702">Ultimately our argument in this case is that this contract is best understood as a means of organizing that nationwide competition to the benefit of patients.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.168" offset="5293796">Exclusive contracts are a method by which hospitals can set anesthesiologists to bidding against one another for the position.</text>

            <text syncTime="1308.635" offset="5387733">Dr. Hyde was asked at one point in the trial why he did not have or did not want an exclusive contract, and his answer was at page 76 of the transcript of the second day and I quote</text>

            <text syncTime="1355.914" offset="5576859">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.795" offset="5588353">The United States contends that the Court of Appeals incorrectly found that the hospital's exclusive dealing contract was an illegal tying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.782" offset="5624298">This decision should be reversed not only because of its adverse impact of the health care industry but also because it distorts important principles of anti-trust law that are of more general application to other segments of the economy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.033" offset="5685320">In our view the primary flaw in the Court of Appeals' opinion is its fixation on labels rather than substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.527" offset="5719279">We start from the premise stated in Times-Picayune and reiterated in Sylvania that competitive realities and substance must dominate anti-trust analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.107" offset="5773614">With this guiding principle in mind I would like to turn to the tying cases decided by this Court deciding with the Motion Pictures Patent case which was not cited in our brief but which is reported in Volume 243 of the U.S. Reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.127" offset="5833695">What emerges from this case, the Motion Picture Patents through Fortner II in 1977 is this: That concern with tying arrangements flows from the potential transfer of economic power from one market into a second market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1439.210" offset="5909973">Ultimately the concern is that two independent monopolies will be created.</text>
            <text syncTime="1445.184" offset="5933901">Now it is common ground that we do not have to wait until that result occurs before action can be taken so the task is to predict when there is a possibility or a substantial threat that such economic harm will result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.765" offset="6000252">Now as it happens the concept of a tying is not easily defined because any sale of a multi-component product or service is susceptible of being called a tying even where the bundling of components in a single package is pro-competitive, produces efficiencies or is done for a legitimate business reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.160" offset="6093770">This has led to a good deal of confusion because if the line is drawn too mechanically as we believe it was in this case then these pro-competitive benefits will be lost even when there is little or no danger of competitive harm.</text>

            <text syncTime="1620.039" offset="6633356">I do not know that they are necessarily much harder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.130" offset="6641715">The next is that even if there are two products here and two markets, the hospital does not have market power in the market for the tying product which is surgical facilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.377" offset="6694691">The findings of the District Court as to the absence of market power in that market appear to be supported by the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="1646.126" offset="6737636">The Court of Appeals did not find the District Court's conclusions as to market power to be clearly erroneous and so we support them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.943" offset="6780895">What the Court of Appeals did was to recognize that under the traditional analysis set down by this Court this case is fairly easily decided, and that is that the hospital lacks sufficient market power in the market for the tying product.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.812" offset="6848396">But because it viewed certain so-called market imperfections that Mr. Easterbrook has referred to it decided to ignore what it recognized was the traditional analysis and the analysis that was required in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.143" offset="6909731">I think the point I would like to get to is that the ease with which the Court of Appeals could under the guise of following accepted tying doctrine as it has been set down by this Court and how it could reach the result that it did which in our view savages an important notion of anti-trust law indicates that perhaps some tightening up of the definition is in order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.925" offset="7048912">What we propose and is described in more detail in our brief is this: that the only time that there is a real concern, a real threat that market power in the first market is going to be transferred and used in a second market is where there is ability to acquire substantial market power in that second market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.996" offset="7157163">I would like to give an illustration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1752.716" offset="7164059">Suppose that a company has a dominant position in the market for rubber stamps for making documents, and it requires that all people who buy its rubber stamps also buy ink.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.504" offset="7227171">Now we are assuming that there is power in the rubber stamp market in this, but in this instance there is no chance that that power could be transferred to the ink market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.403" offset="7270743">The reason is that the portion of the ink market that is used in conjunction with the rubber stamp market is miniscule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.168" offset="7309823">It is so small in fact that a company could not use this tying to obtain power in the ink market.</text>

            <text syncTime="1955.356" offset="7974587">That is because the focus on whether a tying may promote substantial independent power in the tied market conforms to economic reality and has been noted in this Court's decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.574" offset="8019413">Going back to the Motion Picture Patents case the concern was with the effect on competition in this tied market has been made quite clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1976.151" offset="8057761">In that case the Court observed that the evil in tying the use of the patented projector to the films was that it allowed the company to fix the price of films as effectively as it could fix the price on the tying patented projector.</text>

            <text syncTime="2005.029" offset="8173326">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.614" offset="8191612">As the Petitioners point out in their reply brief our perspective in this case is quite different than theirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.038" offset="8221287">Whereas the Petitioners suggestion in this case will decide the legality of all exclusive contracts at all hospitals we do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2027.585" offset="8263501">We believe that this case concerns one particular contract at one particular hospital, and that contract has got to be judged under the particular market and competitive conditions that are reflected in the record of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.254" offset="8326195">Whereas the Petitioners ask the Court to decide this case by making certain assumptions regarding those competitive conditions and regarding those market conditions, we do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.455" offset="8382933">We submit that this case... We submit that when the Petitioners' assumptions are compared with the record of this case they just do not stand up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.901" offset="8424729">I would like to discuss two crucial assumptions that the Petitioners' arguments are based on.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.705" offset="8448030">Perhaps the most important assumption is that the Petitioners asked the Court to assume that there is no competition among anesthesiologists to begin with, and this is obviously an important assumption because if it is correct the Petitioner should win the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.057" offset="8521382">After all, if there is no competition to begin with then it would be hard to argue that a tying arrangement restrains competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.333" offset="8562446">However, we submit the argument that that assumption is not correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.888" offset="8580732">The record indicates that anesthesiologists can and do compete against each other for patients' business when they are able to, when they are permitted to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.162" offset="8621796">The basis of the Petitioners' argument or their assumption that there is no competition is their view of the market structure in the health care industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2129.601" offset="8671534">They contend that patients purchase medical care regardless of the kind, regardless of the nature from hospitals rather than from doctors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.739" offset="8712076">According to the Petitioners patients simply present themselves at the door of the hospital and ask for medical treatment, and they really have no greater interest in who performs surgery on them or who more directly in this case who puts them to sleep for that surgery than they would as to who supplies the thermometer that is given to them in the hospital.</text>

            <text syncTime="3758.857" offset="15188562">In summary, I would like to emphasize three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.120" offset="15209669">First, the Court should look to the actual market conditions and not to theoretical models of noncompetition in deciding the legality of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.846" offset="15244569">That requires looking at the case from the perspective of the patients and anesthesiologists, not from the perspective of the hospital.</text>
            <text syncTime="3780.991" offset="15277170">Second, that the exclusive contract injured competition is undeniable, and I do not think Petitioners deny it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3790.066" offset="15313428">The only question relates to the significance of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.760" offset="15324190">They claim that there is a national market and that any local restraint necessarily is insignificant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.484" offset="15347073">We claim that national market argument is unfounded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.014" offset="15361179">Third, the per se rule against tying arrangements was expressly designed to prevent the evils occurred here, that is, a coercion of consumers to buy goods from one competitor to the exclusion of all others and second the exclusion of competitors, the exclusion of potential suppliers of the tied point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.379" offset="15446652">If there are no further questions we will rest on our brief.</text>
