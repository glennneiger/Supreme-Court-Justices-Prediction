            <text syncTime="174.974" offset="803425">Well, I would say that that order is illegal, null and void because the Court that issued it had no jurisdiction to issue it.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.261" offset="852535">Now, Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.204" offset="872283">In this case, the appellee's claim is based upon a complaint that they have been denied access to the full and complete access to the at-large election system provided by the Florida Constitution and to the political process leading to the nominations and elections in the County Commission of Escambia County.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.365" offset="1017002">I should have said that Escambia County is adjacent to Pensacola.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.527" offset="1045632">It had 205,000 people in it in 1970, 233,000 in 1980, 19.7 of those are Black, in 1970, 16.20% of them were eligible voters, in 1980, 17.2 were eligible voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.219" offset="1156391">Of the eligible voters, 66.9 of the Blacks are registered, 69.7 of the Whites are registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.031" offset="1215637">So there's -- on registration and on really participation in the electoral process that way, they're pretty equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.748" offset="1262448">Now, first of all, in the second sentence of their brief, they say that they do not contend in this case that any statute or any part of the Constitution has been invalidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.910" offset="1339144">And so I address myself to jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.531" offset="1361609">We are concerned here with the State Constitution of Florida over which Escambia has no control whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.678" offset="1398181">The State Constitution requires at-large elections in non-charter counties of which there are 62 and of which Escambia is one.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.319" offset="1440812">In connection with that constitutional provision, they have also adopted an election system which is (Inaudible) to carry out these elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.783" offset="1502670">And so, the requirement of at-large elections and the requirements for carrying it out are entirely state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.551" offset="1557736">And so we raise the question as to whether or not the requirements of Article III clause 2 or Section 2 Clause 1 of the Constitution has been met because the real controversy here is not between Escambia and these people who claim they have been harmed by the at-large elections which are and put in, maintained, operated entirely by the State of Florida.</text>

            <text syncTime="954.450" offset="3921296">So, they appointed a charter study committee of five, one of whom was a Black to draw up a new charter for the County of Escambia as they have a right to do.</text>

            <text syncTime="1021.685" offset="4190252">Number one, they said “We do not need to charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.271" offset="4200597">It's too costly and too complex."</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.131" offset="4216061">"We don't need seven commissioners.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.089" offset="4255872">And so the Commissioners then appointed another study committee of five.</text>

            <text syncTime="1073.990" offset="4399441">They put in there the main thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.433" offset="4413234">They put in there that this could never be used to consolidate Pensacola and Escambia.</text>
            <text syncTime="1085.599" offset="4445939">That seemed to be the major thing that bothered the people there then.</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.877" offset="4467046">And they also revised throughout the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1096.980" offset="4491392">And when they finished that revision, they called in their staff and had them go over it and finally by August, they were ready to go public, so to speak, with the results of the work on the charter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.302" offset="4580731">And so, they announced that they were going to release a draft of this charter and publish it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1129.266" offset="4620541">They published it in the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.897" offset="4627124">It gave out 15,000 copies to various clubs, study clubs and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.005" offset="4651470">And they would then have eight public hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1148.266" offset="4696610">Now, let me stop here to say the big difference between this charter study committee and a chartered commission under Florida law is, a charter commission, you're required to have 11 to 15 members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.215" offset="4764319">They're supposed to work for 18 months and produce a charter unless the time is extended.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.714" offset="4786367">And then when -- they hold three public hearings and they turn the charter in, the Commissioners can't do anything about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.403" offset="4821162">They can't change it at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.478" offset="4833387">The Commissioners here made tremendous changes in this charter and one of them was to keep the five elected at-large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.315" offset="4880721">Now, the other side pretends this was the-- the big thing that was before the people in connection with the referendum which I announced would take place on November 8.</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.960" offset="4947385">They held these eight hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.215" offset="4960342">They were shocked at the fact that only 15 or 20 people came out to the various hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.360" offset="4984897">In one of these hearings, three Blacks did appear and say they wanted single-member districts, that Blacks could get a fair deal if they had single-member districts than if they had elections at-large.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.378" offset="5044979">And so, after discussion in advertising and this -- all that kind of thing and they finally adopted on the 14th of September, a final draft which was published in the newspapers and was given to anybody who wanted to study it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.233" offset="5160440">And that draft was voted on, then in November and defeated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.735" offset="5186458">And so then, we were into 1978 and we come to the pretrial statement of the appellees here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.794" offset="5274648">And again, as in the complaint, a referendum wasn't mentioned in -- in the complaint or the possibility of having itIt wasn't mentioned in their pretrial statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.678" offset="5338177">The pretrial statement was just the one that I just read you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.916" offset="5351134">It was all aimed at the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.408" offset="5365136">And so at the hearing before Judge Arnow, they asked each one of the commissioners that each testified as to why they favored at-large rather than single-member districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.602" offset="5441936">And the general purport of it was the problems are at-large and so therefore, the cure must be at-large.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.263" offset="6316515">And they said, we're not taking back our statement about the incumbency and they didn't take back their statement about having read all the evidence and found no racial motivation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3004.831" offset="12122804">There are three principal historical era -- eras, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="3010.313" offset="12144747">From the Civil War to the turn of the century, Blacks were allowed to vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.859" offset="12162928">They were registered and in some North Florida counties, constituted a majority of the voters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.187" offset="12184244">The fear of perhaps Black getting elected and holding a county commissioner or school board office, they didn't even hold elections then.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.498" offset="12213501">They had them by gubernatorial appointment because the State of Florida was majority White.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.083" offset="12231787">Then once Blacks were disenfranchised, at the turn of the century, they went to this anomalous system of single-member district primary elections and at-large general elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.326" offset="12280793">Then World War II, veterans returned, Black veterans returned and want to participate in government, Smith, the all rights strikes down, the all--White democratic primary and the rules of the game are changed again.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.592" offset="12333874">This time they abolished the single-member district democratic primaries and go to the at-large democratic primaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="3064.549" offset="12361668">So that -- those three major historical shifts, put in the context with the manipulation, if you will, of these charter government study committee reports, the very specific contemporary evidence of a similar change in the City of Pensacola Government in 1959 and the School Board of Escambia County in 1976, that's the contextual arena that the district judge had to -- made this finding (Inaudible) and that doesn't even touch the polarized voting and lack of Black candidates, no Blacks having ever been elected, the other factors that this Court has referred to in other opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.940" offset="12555288">The -- I would note some of the other evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.047" offset="12595725">I've mentioned the substantial record on polarized voting approximately 168 regression analysis, not only did that measure a polarized voting and produced scattered diagrams for all of those elections, we also ran a test to measure voter turnout.</text>
            <text syncTime="3138.905" offset="12659150">This was confirmed by other studies and it showed that Blacks turn out at a rate of approximately half that of White voters and this we think is a significant measure of Black political participation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.835" offset="12706798">It's one thing to have a voter registration drive to urge people to go down and get their names into polls, but the degree that people are hooked into the political system, the degree that they vote and participate -- political scientists call it political socialization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.301" offset="12768656">I grew up in a house where my parents sat around the table and we'd talk politics and you had a duty to go vote.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.125" offset="12791957">That's essentially the kind of institution that has not been present, as present in the Black community and it hasn't been present because Blacks haven't been seeking office or candidates who addressed the interest of Black citizens haven't been seeking office.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.470" offset="12849426">And we did run tests on some White candidates who had -- generally they were presidential candidates or outside of Escambia County jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.491" offset="12885475">The same phenomena occurs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3197.427" offset="12893208">In many cases, Black voters will go to the poll and if there's a candidate that has addressed their interests, they will vote in that race.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.457" offset="12921315">But contrary to the behavior of most White voters, they would not pull the lever on all those other races that are on the ballot.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.618" offset="12949945">And that's what these social scientists or whatever talking about in terms of political socialization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.365" offset="12972933">How involved are you in the system and you had the opportunity to work on a campaign or get involved with and see that your interests are at stake.</text>

            <text syncTime="3405.212" offset="13724319">But I think the fundamental question is found, effective representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.868" offset="13738948">And as this Court has had to deal with since Baker versus Carr, and Reynolds versus Sims, stay on effect of representation is, in those cases focused on numerical figure of maximum deviation from an ideal district.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.362" offset="13796940">Now, every citizen has a right to that and it is just as possible to gerrymander districts by having one giant district, having five smaller districts or even as one plan that was submitted and I think later withdrawn early in this litigation by the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.932" offset="13859216">We call it the ban to (Inaudible) plan, proposed having one district in the middle of the county that would be Black and the other four commissioners would be elected at-large from the rest of the county.</text>
            <text syncTime="3448.643" offset="13898086">That plan was withdrawn perhaps after we named it the (Inaudible) in playing up to the South African homelands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.658" offset="13922119">But these systems can all be manipulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.367" offset="13936956">It is as much a political decision to have an at-large system as it is, to have district system and as much a political decision is to how the district lines should be drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.897" offset="13971124">So we have had -- this Court has developed a long line of cases from the one person, one vote concept and has had a rather easily manageable -- rather easily manageable standard judicially manageable standard of numerical equality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3490.106" offset="14063911">But Black citizens have a strong claim to protection under the Fourteenth Amendment and what this case shows is that at-large election systems can have and has had in this case for many, many, many years, far more than a decennial census, the opportunity to dilute the vote of the minority to deny the equal protection under the law.</text>
