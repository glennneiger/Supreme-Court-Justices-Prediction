            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="138689">We'll hear arguments next in Norfolk Redevelopment against Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.799" offset="181843">Mr. Crenshaw, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis N. Crenshaw</label>
            <text syncTime="80.302" offset="459891">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="86.036" offset="482774">The question in this case is whether the Respondent telephone company is eligible under the terms of the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Properties Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to be reimbursed for its costs when it disconnects transmission lines beneath certain streets in the City of Norfolk, Virginia and rebuilds replacement lines under new streets.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.369" offset="616103">The claim was submitted to the Petitioner, Redevelopment Authority, and was denied because it felt that the common law requires a utility company to move its transmission lines at its expense, and the Uniform Act did not change the common law.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.426" offset="716309">Furthermore, the telephone company did not meet the threshold requirements for eligibility under the Uniform Act because it did not move personal property, and it did not move any property as a result of the acquisition of land.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.419" offset="804289">Now the telephone company had installed its facilities in the streets of Norfolk pursuant to a franchise with the City of Norfolk by virtue of which it had a mere license.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.580" offset="864998">It was a franchisee and it is the established common law in Virginia and in the overwhelming majority of other states that a utility company having such a franchise has the obligation of moving its lines at its own expense when the public good requires those lines to be relocated.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.126" offset="967189">This a long-standing and well understood and respected custom and the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit would change that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.744" offset="1009611">Now in this case these transmission lines were rerouted because of the execution by the Petitioner, Redevelopment Authority, of conservation and redevelopment projects within the City of Norfolk.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.573" offset="1072932">Under those projects areas of blighted property were acquired.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.738" offset="1093621">The old buildings were demolished and the cleared land was made available for redevelopment.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.572" offset="1116922">In certain instances it was necessary and desirable to rearrange certain streets, and the Redevelopment Authority petitioned the City of Norfolk to close streets so that the new street pattern could be established.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.282" offset="1183796">The city did close those streets, and in a very cooperative manner the city, the Petitioner and the City of Norfolk worked together with the telephone company to work out an arrangement for the new streets to be built in a manner that the public and the private utilities could be laid within those streets with a minimum of inconvenience to all of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.299" offset="1295809">There was no coercion no eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.963" offset="1314513">It was all done in a friendly and matter-of-fact way, and there was no request for any reimbursement.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.508" offset="1340635">Over a year after the redevelopment work had been done and the new streets had been laid the telephone company filed its claim which had been denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.165" offset="1391313">I think it is important that the Court recognize the nature of the facilities that are here involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.553" offset="1424854">By and large they are massive.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.675" offset="1437288">They are permanent.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.015" offset="1442722">They are embedded in the ground, and we have contended that they have become real estate.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.338" offset="1464038">They consist primarily of conduits which are about four inches in diameter which carry cooper cables which have as many as 3600 pairs in them.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.126" offset="1507192">Those conduits extend between underground vaults which are known as manholes.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.708" offset="1525478">These manholes are larger than a man is tall.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.012" offset="1542718">They are like a little subterranean womb.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.343" offset="1552018">The walls are a foot thick.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.532" offset="1556720">They have a collar that connects the top of the manholes to the street and when the--</text>

            <text syncTime="360.198" offset="1579394">Mr. Crenshaw, I suppose the Fourth Circuit has determined that as a matter of state law these things were personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.913" offset="1618265">Is that right?</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis N. Crenshaw</label>
            <text syncTime="388.225" offset="1691512">--I think that is a reasonably fair statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.746" offset="1701647">I think there is a little equivocation there, yes.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="393.658" offset="1713246">All right.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.750" offset="1717634">Do we not normally defer to a Circuit Court of Appeals determination on state law issues and leave that alone?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="francis_n_crenshaw" startTime="405.166" stopTime="464.794">
            <label>Mr. Francis N. Crenshaw</label>
            <text syncTime="405.166" offset="1759326">I would think so, but the difficulty here is I think you had a flat out decision by the Virginia Supreme Court which is contrary to the Fourth Circuit, and the Fourth Circuit in my judgment was a not too exhaustively reasoned opinion with respect to that so that I think that it is not facetious for me to assert in this Court that these facilities were in effect real property and not personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.853" offset="1866010">Manifestly they are so massive and so connected that they have to be real property, and the case Transcontinental which was cited by both parties in this case holds that underground gas mains are real property, and the rationale that the Fourth Circuit relied upon is a rather small point which was not really applied to the underground mains but was applied to machinery that was in the Transcontinental case.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.433" offset="1988367">That is the reason that I mention that here.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="464.794" offset="1997771">Is it essential to your argument that we disagree with the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit about what kind of property?</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis N. Crenshaw</label>
            <text syncTime="471.620" offset="2025148">There are three bases on which I would contend that the claim would be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.383" offset="2048136">That is one of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.843" offset="2053987">I do not have to win on all three, but I think they are all three sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.838" offset="2073945">The first one is that the Act did not cover utilities at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.072" offset="2102888">This, I think, is the most compelling argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.636" offset="2121174">The Uniform Act was passed after a decade of extensive congressional committee inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.190" offset="2159417">It followed a prior decade when the highway statutes had been considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.697" offset="2189406">During the 1950's the Federal-Aid Highway statutes came along and in those hearings there was expressed and careful attention to the requirements of the utility companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.674" offset="2233291">The Highway Act contains Section 123 which dealt with utility companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.309" offset="2259832">Contrarywise during the 1960's when the hearings were being held on the Uniform Relocation Act there was no congressional inquiry into the plight of the utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.833" offset="2301941">There were--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="541.714" offset="2305494">Why do you suppose that is?</text>
            <text syncTime="543.595" offset="2313017">It seems so strange that no discussion of that emerged.</text>

          <turn speaker="francis_n_crenshaw" startTime="548.329" stopTime="561.968">
            <label>Mr. Francis N. Crenshaw</label>
            <text syncTime="548.329" offset="2331930">--The only reason that I can say is that the Congress was satisfied with the solution given by the Highway Act because that solution which was in Section 123 was retained.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.578" offset="2380936">It was not changed.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="561.968" stopTime="582.201">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="561.968" offset="2386473">But, of course, in the language of the Relocation Act in defining a person it did not admit of any exception, and I think it is just strange that there would not be some reference in the legislative history to the utility problem.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="francis_n_crenshaw" startTime="582.201" stopTime="796.004">
            <label>Mr. Francis N. Crenshaw</label>
            <text syncTime="582.201" offset="2467453">I think it is strange that in all of those hearings with the hundreds really of representatives that there was no movement by utilities to have had their particular problem addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.172" offset="2523355">I think that the overwhelming reason was that the Uniform Relocation Act dealt with the acquisition of private property by and large from individuals and small businesses.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.761" offset="2573719">The C&amp;P does not have private property.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.051" offset="2586885">It does not have a compensable property interest in its franchise.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.796" offset="2605798">The Fugate case by the Supreme Court of Virginia has held that their interest as a licensee does not amount to a compensable property interest so that I think that the purpose of the Uniform Act was to help those people whose property was being taken by eminent domain and to supplement the benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.857" offset="2686046">The people who were getting fair market value under the principles of eminent domain were not being fairly treated.</text>
            <text syncTime="644.962" offset="2718438">A hardware store, for example, that was in a redevelopment project if their property was condemned they would get the fair market value of the building, but unless they got relocation costs they would not get the cost to move to a new location and they had to compete against another hardware store in the community who had the fair market value of their property.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.978" offset="2806522">It had not been taken, but they did not have to move.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.849" offset="2818016">That was the kind of disproportionate burden that I think the committees looked into.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.535" offset="2844766">The statistics are overwhelming that that is the sort of thing that they inquired about.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.446" offset="2860439">I think the statute had primarily humanitarian interests, the small person, the mom and pop business, those things who moved personal property in the common ordinary sense of personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.867" offset="2922088">I just do not see anywhere in this statute or its legislative history any contemplation of the problem of utility lines, and as the District Court noted this matter was not under the table or hidden or secret at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.146" offset="2987185">There was a live controversy right across the Potomac in Virginia where PEPCO and the Virginia Highway Commission were going through all sorts of litigation about this very matter, but it was related to Section 123 of the Highway Act so that I think that the Act just simply did not contemplate it.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.993" offset="3086660">When you compare the Uniform Act to actions of the Congress before the Highway statute or actions of the Congress afterwards, in 1972 it adopted legislation which permitted relocation costs to utilities in the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="754.976" offset="3158549">Specifically the committees dealt with that problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.838" offset="3174013">They recognized that if they did not pass this the utility companies would not be compensated, and that was two years after the Uniform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.615" offset="3213092">Again, this past May in the Senate they have adopted amendments to this very statute that we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.310" offset="3247887">I realize this is after this claim and after this decision, but still it is the same committee of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.424" offset="3276309">It is the same thrust that is being explained.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.827" offset="3289997">I think that the action by the Congress or the Senate this last May is very revealing about the congressional intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="803.377" offset="3352168">With respect to the highways it is interesting that Chapter 5 of the Highway Act was amended and repealed, but Section 123 of the Highway Act which pertained to utilities was left exactly as it was so that the Uniform Act came up and sat on top of Section 123.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.753" offset="3445687">It refers to the comment by Justice Powell in the previous case.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.187" offset="3463345">There you have a specific statute, Section 123, which deals with utility relocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.200" offset="3491453">You have a general statute, the Uniform Relocation Act, which was passed in foreknowledge of the Highway statute which says nothing about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.886" offset="3522173">I think that simply shouts out that the Uniform Act does not contemplate utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="851.752" offset="3545683">There are 21 federal agencies which administer some 50 programs that are affected by this Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.964" offset="3570447">None of them have regulations which pertain to utility relocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.969" offset="3590509">HUD which is the agency which was involved here has a specific regulation that the relocation costs for a utility transmission line is not an eligible cost unless the state law requires it.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.068" offset="3654875">That regulation was in effect before the Uniform Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.341" offset="3668041">It is in effect after the Uniform Act and there was no change by HUD.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.414" offset="3684341">So surely the agencies which interpret this Act as well as the utility companies in the localities have dealt with this Act as not including utilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.623" offset="3733138">Now there are two threshold requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.986" offset="3754558">I have alluded briefly to one, that is, you must move personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.397" offset="3772217">I contend that it is not personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.348" offset="3784025">I think these facilities manifestly are real property, but secondly they were not moved.</text>

            <text syncTime="1181.057" offset="4862882">We have concluded that it is an erroneous construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.159" offset="4883257">The position we urge is the same one we urged in the Court of Appeals, and if I might just say this, our reason for concluding that it is erroneous is based frankly on a closer study of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.757" offset="4933621">We believe that we have identified concrete statutory language that this claim simply does not fit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.051" offset="4962878">So that contrary to what we said in the unfortunate brief we filed at the petition stage, this case simply does not in our view involve interpolating an exception into plain statutory language that covers the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.911" offset="5022333">That is what the Court of Appeals thought it involved, and if that were true the Court of Appeals might be right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.316" offset="5047933">But we believe that the statutory requirement which says that payment shall be made for moving of personal property or for moving one's self or one's business simply cannot comfortably be made to cover the situation of reconstructing utility lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.530" offset="5116792">I think the words are important, and the reality is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.273" offset="5131734">This really is a construction job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.623" offset="5141138">The Respondent... I refer to C&amp;P as the Respondent... says in their answering brief that we are in no position to deny that their claims represent certain matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.053" offset="5198816">One of the things they say they represent are the costs of reconstructing those lines.</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.015" offset="5218669">I take that to be a concession that what we are talking about for the largest part is the cost of digging new trenches, pouring new concrete, installing new pipes, laying and installing new cables, and it seems to me that it would be a very odd choice of words indeed to use the words "moving personal property" if one wanted to describe those operations and paying for those costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.731" offset="5321592">If I might turn to something Justice O'Connor asked, the Court is not confronted necessarily with the question of whether the Fourth Circuit misunderstood Virginia law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1307.188" offset="5367358">There is a question here whether this equipment, these lines are real or personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.526" offset="5400691">The government is skeptical of the Fourth Circuit's conclusion that it is all personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.780" offset="5429739">If the Court please, the Petitioner has lodged with the clerk an illustration of a sample utility manhole which is as far as we can see an underground building, and if you look closely at the Court of Appeals' opinion I would suggest that the Court of Appeals may have simply misunderstood what the physical equipment involved was and what the operation of replacing it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.197" offset="5535378">The Court of Appeals appears to have believed that this equipment was removed from its location and transferred to a new location.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.553" offset="5564844">Because of that misunderstanding I think the ordinary deference to the Court of Appeals reading of state law is not required here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.127" offset="5603192">But even if it were, the question necessarily presented is a federal one, the question of what Congress meant by "moving".</text>
            <text syncTime="1374.333" offset="5636002">That is the term in the federal statute as to which there is no reason to believe that state law was intended to be controlling.</text>

            <text syncTime="1457.097" offset="5967025">We would submit that at a minimum this language "moving personal property" is sufficiently ambiguous that it is not sufficient to stop with the statutory language, and it is sensible to go beyond it and look at the usual indicia of legislative intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.418" offset="6040273">In this case the first thing we are confronted by is the rather stark silence in the ten year long legislative record, and I might add that representatives of the American Right of Way Association which represents the interests of the utilities insofar as rights of way are concerned did speak at the hearings on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.682" offset="6125327">But they never suggested that this statute would or that it should alter the established common law rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.417" offset="6152286">Accordingly, while this would be an easier case if someone has said the obvious, it appears to us that everyone understood that this issue, the question of relocation assistance, was one that was governed by a well-established rule of state law and that absent any indication of an intent to change it Congress must have intended to leave it where it was especially because in 1956 in the Highway Act Congress had demonstrated that it was aware of the state law rule and that it chose for Highway Act purposes to defer to that state rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.001" offset="6298676">Now the Uniform Relocation Act does not say except insofar as provided by other law the following payments shall be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.566" offset="6336919">It says all federal acquisition shall be controlled and federally assisted acquisitions shall be controlled by this statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.773" offset="6373700">Given that, it is difficult for us to understand why Congress apparently quite deliberately left in effect provisions of the Highway Act which said thou may pay relocation assistance but only if state law provides for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.805" offset="6445902">If there were any question left in the wake of that Act in 1972 when Congress turned to the question again in the District of Columbia Public Utilities Reimbursement Act when Congress provided specifically for the purposes of interstate highways that these monies should be paid, that portion of the statute would have had precisely no effect and would have been entirely superfluous if the Uniform Relocation Act in 1970 had set aside the rule of Section 123 of the Highway Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.589" offset="6581007">As it happened, Congress did set aside other provisions of the Highway Act, Title 23, Sections 501 and the following sections which dealt with other provisions of relocation assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.165" offset="6635342">So one cannot even say that Congress might have overlooked the Highway Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.127" offset="6647149">If you go through this statute and if you go through the House and Senate committee reports you will find an extraordinarily detailed listing set out in haec verba of each of the statutory texts that was repealed in many sections of the Highway Act that are to be found there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.808" offset="6713918">It is just very difficult for me to believe that Congress just missed this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.353" offset="6740041">It appears that Congress chose to leave Section 123 and its rule which defers to state law in effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.568" offset="6768880">There is another thing that one can garner from looking at the several occasions on which Congress has addressed the question of relocation assistance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.305" offset="6811825">Congress has used different language to speak to this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.798" offset="6825827">In the District of Columbia Act of 1972 Congress spoke of abandoning, relocating, reconstructing, reestablishing, and used a large number of terms which speak to the capital building process.</text>

            <text syncTime="1759.364" offset="7176077">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1763.758" offset="7193631">I believe we should first make quite clear that there is no uncertainty on the record in this case about the nature of the telephone company's claim, the nature of the expenses for which it claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1783.760" offset="7273670">There is no need to speculate from what is said in the briefs whether they correctly described them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.246" offset="7307629">Those claims were filed in the beginning and have been in the possession of both Petitioner and the federal defendant since that time and still are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.975" offset="7366562">Those claims are for the nonbetterment cost of reconstructing, the nonbetterment cost of moving utility lines, a completely familiar concept that is observed and applied every day.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.027" offset="7430718">It involves determining the true cost of moving by starting with the cost of rebuilding which is inevitably required whenever you move a utility line for the most part unless there happened to be overhead poles that can be moved or wires that can be moved and used again which would be exceptional.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.294" offset="7543776">But in all events in the multitude of cases in which a utility company moves its lines at the expense of someone else whether by contract or under voluntary arrangement at the time the parties well understood here from the beginning from the time these claims were filed as they understood when they stipulated that a similar expense if it happened to be a municipal system, stipulated in those words in this case, that the nonbetterment cost if it happened to be a municipal line is part of the cost of the project or is carried as the city's share, I guess the city's share of the total project cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.268" offset="7739695">So there should not be any uncertainty about the fact that this case from the beginning has involved claims for the relocation, for moving the lines in the only sense in which the vicinities of most displaced persons which happen to use heavy or large equipment and structures which are not part of the land taken because they are severed from it by agreement or by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.040" offset="7886816">As the Fourth Circuit has determined it, these were severed by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.565" offset="7912939">They were personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.327" offset="7923910">Since they are not taken, then the expense of moving them, relocating them would be one of those inequitable expenses and burdens borne by a particular class of people instead of being borne--</text>

            <text syncTime="3038.642" offset="12293256">It is indeed possible and under this view of what is meant by "moved" the utility companies and all other displaced companies including the chainsaw company involved in the Beaird-Poulan case discussed where they moved plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3056.224" offset="12363577">They did not pick that plant up and move it, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3058.865" offset="12374131">They did not pick much up and move it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.907" offset="12386251">They moved a whole plant, and the Court concluded that the Beaird-Poulan moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3070.803" offset="12421882">It is also the answer to the suggestion that maybe you have to move your entire business.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.359" offset="12464096">The chain saw plant was most assuredly not the only business of the Emerson Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="3087.604" offset="12489069">That is why the statute was so careful to define what activity is, what a business means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.908" offset="12522297">It means any activity conducted for a business purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.410" offset="12536299">That activity was moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.751" offset="12545598">Whether we all could agree that the company moved that is what everyone would say in common parlance and that the power line was moved, the underground lines were moved, that is what everyone would say in common parlance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.814" offset="12617905">We say that is what the Act meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3122.546" offset="12628772">Whether we could all agree on that or not, most assuredly the activity was moved to the new location.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.311" offset="12655835">I trust the Court understands that from the time when the claims were first filed right through... I cannot recall how many years of administrative consideration of those claims... two years in the trial court, a total of three years in litigation, the parties seem to be fully agreed that we had moved the lines and that we had moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.885" offset="12870144">There was never any contention to the contrary ever asserted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.198" offset="12883414">That continued to be true down through the time when the government's first brief was filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.885" offset="12922180">Having declined to join in a petition for writ of error, the government's position was not quite fully stated just now by the Solicitor General.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.033" offset="12974738">The statement there twice was that the plain terms of the Act that the Court of Appeals had merely followed the plain terms of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.930" offset="13014340">Nothing has happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3222.510" offset="13028655">At that point the Department of Justice had been defending this litigation on behalf of the United States for more than three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.637" offset="13065226">It has in the trial court supported the administrative interpretation until the Fourth Circuit held that it was contrary to the plain terms of the Act after which the Solicitor General concluded and informed the Court in its brief in opposition that the Court of Appeals cannot be said to have erred in following the plain language of the Act and that the arguments to the contrary of the Petitioner and amicus supporting the Petitioner were made despite the Act's plain terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.065" offset="13218931">Nothing has been said to explain how in the next five months the Act's plain terms became any less plain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.330" offset="13251949">I think attention should be called to the anomalous consequences that would arise out of any interpretation of the word "move personal property" in this or move property that would limit it to the case when it can be bodily transplanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.626" offset="13417148">The law was never intended to treat differently the power company, the gas company that takes up his lines and moves them and uses them again and the one where it is not feasible and not sensible to do that and puts new ones in the new place and recovers compensation only for the difference between the old and the new or the loss, the actual cost of putting itself back where it was by reconstructing and relocating its facilities in a new place.</text>

            <label>Mr. Francis N. Crenshaw</label>
            <text syncTime="3363.255" offset="13591646">I have just a couple of words if I might, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.997" offset="13602617">I would like to call to the Court's attention that the complaint at paragraph 7 alleges that these lines were moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3375.985" offset="13642532">The Redevelopment Authority's answer at paragraph 7 denies those allegations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.368" offset="13664057">The stipulation... That is at page 21 of the Joint Appendix... which refers to the term C&amp;P has removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.649" offset="13729259">Then we stipulate that then any that have been removed were removed subject January the 2nd.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.422" offset="13756322">I do not think we have articulated well our argument on removal, but it certainly has been in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3412.970" offset="13790490">The second thing I would like to say is that this statute was passed to supplement benefits of people whose private property was taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="3423.376" offset="13832181">In this case we are dealing with the acquisition or the removal or reconstruction of lines in public property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3431.450" offset="13864469">The public street was where the lines were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.884" offset="13882127">When the streets were closed the Redevelopment Authority owned them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3439.925" offset="13898323">It is a political subdivision of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.018" offset="13906682">It is still public property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.518" offset="13912743">Nowhere in this are we talking about taking a compensable property interest, and the telephone company has not cited and I do not believe they can cite any case in which benefits under the relocation statute are conferred unless there is the acquisition of a compensable interest in real property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.685" offset="14001350">We think the claim should be denied.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.777" offset="14013785">Thank you.</text>
