            <label>Mr. C. Thomas Hectus</label>
            <text syncTime="11.539" offset="188177">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.908" offset="201656">This case is here on petition for writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court of Kentucky.</text>
            <text syncTime="20.395" offset="223599">The issue involved is whether or not the trial court was constitutionally required to admonish the jury that they could draw no adverse inference from petitioner's failure to testify at his state criminal trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.987" offset="285979">The Kentucky Supreme Court apparently applied a procedural bar to the relief requested, relying on this court's decision in Carter v. Kentucky that although an instruction was constitutionally compelled, an admonition was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.501" offset="368004">Implicitly, the Kentucky Supreme Court also ruled that as a matter of substantive constitutional criminal procedure, that petitioner was not entitled to an admonition regardless of Kentucky evidentiary rules.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="71.594" stopTime="92.191">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="71.594" offset="428399">Was there anything to prevent counsel, when the court ruled, to say I intend my motion in the sense of an instruction, an admonition or an instruction, in the alternative, treating them, even though they are not, treating them as though they are synonyms?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="c_thomas_hectus" startTime="92.191" stopTime="103.999">
            <label>Mr. C. Thomas Hectus</label>
            <text syncTime="92.191" offset="510841">Certainly, Mr. Chief Justice, there is nothing requiring counsel from asking for relief in the alternative.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="103.999" stopTime="105.515">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="103.999" offset="558071">Nothing preventing him.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="c_thomas_hectus" startTime="105.515" stopTime="232.860">
            <label>Mr. C. Thomas Hectus</label>
            <text syncTime="105.515" offset="564131">Nothing preventing him, and certainly there was nothing preventing the trial court from performing its obligation that once it was put on notice that the defendant wanted some sort of jury guidance, no matter how that jury guidance is phrased, whether as an admonition, an oral, authoritative communication to the jury, or as an instruction in writing containing the law of the case, certainly I think the judge was on notice as to the relief that the defendant wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.134" offset="686593">If he thought it was improper, I think he had fair notice under the Kentucky rules of criminal procedure to go ahead and give the instruction that is also mandated under those same rules upon timely request.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.608" offset="732464">I think that this issue has great importance because of the fact that the petitioner in this case was tried on three separate and distinct charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.249" offset="787008">He was tried for receiving stolen property, a handgun that had been stolen from the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.588" offset="812399">He was tried for a subsequent burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.807" offset="829222">And he was also tried for a still later rape, all of the same victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.461" offset="851896">Petitioner presented no evidence in his behalf as to either the receiving stolen property or as to the burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.281" offset="883139">He presented only evidence as to his apparent lack of presence at the scene at the time of the rape.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.987" offset="922009">So in other words, at the time this case went to the jury on the receiving stolen property charge, the only thing that the jury had before them was evidence that he was in fact in possession of a handgun which had been stolen.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.045" offset="978224">There was no evidence showing that possession was in any way knowing, and I think in that particular case the absence of the admonition was critical.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.566" offset="1012288">As to the burglary, the only evidence of the burglary of May 1, 1981 of the victim's residence linking the petitioner to that residence was one fingerprint on the inside of a door panel at petitioner's apartment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="232.860" stopTime="237.847">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="232.860" offset="1073519">Well, when you emphasize one, would it have made any difference if there were eight of them?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="c_thomas_hectus" startTime="237.847" stopTime="304.356">
            <label>Mr. C. Thomas Hectus</label>
            <text syncTime="237.847" offset="1093477">I think it would have made a difference depending upon where those fingerprints were.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.616" offset="1108523">I think the locations of certain fingerprints are more incriminating than the location of the fingerprint in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.770" offset="1133078">In this case the victim testified that petitioner had been in her apartment on several other occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.090" offset="1154394">It is not unreasonable to assume that somebody entering or leaving an apartment might leave their fingerprint on the inside of a glass door panel as opposed to, for example, a safe breaking case where a defendant's fingerprints are found on the inside of a safe to which he had no legal or proper access.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.433" offset="1223775">I think in this case that fingerprint was certainly neutral as to incriminating the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.288" offset="1251152">The defendant had asked for a severance of that particular charge from the other charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.656" offset="1268706">That severance was denied, and I think that that is one of the things that the Court should consider in considering the entire context of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.096" offset="1302456">We are not merely speaking to petitioner's rape conviction here which was subsequently enhanced in terms of sentencing to a life sentence on the basis of his being a persistent felony offender, which--</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="331.356" stopTime="343.497">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="331.356" offset="1467446">And Kentucky law, I take it, is perfectly clear that only written instructions will be given and that counsel has to present written instructions?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="c_thomas_hectus" startTime="343.497" stopTime="372.500">
            <label>Mr. C. Thomas Hectus</label>
            <text syncTime="343.497" offset="1516033">--It is perfectly clear that the trial court has an obligation to instruct the jury in writing.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.968" offset="1541947">It is not perfectly clear because it is not a matter of state law that the defendant has to tender written instructions in order to preserve that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.423" offset="1579772">Kentucky rule of criminal procedure specifically provides that the defendant can request an instruction or by motion request an instruction or object to an instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.381" offset="1623553">Certainly here there was an adequate motion made.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="372.500" stopTime="381.356">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="372.500" offset="1632017">And in Kentucky law... all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.100" offset="1634420">And in Kentucky law there has been a distinction made, has there not, between instructions and admonitions?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="c_thomas_hectus" startTime="381.356" stopTime="545.188">
            <label>Mr. C. Thomas Hectus</label>
            <text syncTime="381.356" offset="1667439">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.456" offset="1671828">An admonition has been defined in Kentucky law as any authoritative communication of the court to the jury regarding their duty or conduct as jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.312" offset="1711325">I certainly think that with regard to the Fifth Amendment privilege, an admonition with regard to the defendant's Fifth Amendment privilege and the use to which the jury should put that has to do with their duty as jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.469" offset="1763883">So I think that we come squarely within the terms of an admonition.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.421" offset="1779766">As a matter of fact, this Court is well aware that oftentimes when Griffin errors are committed by prosecutors with regard to comment on the defendant's failure to testify, the appropriate relief is for the court to admonish the jury that they can't consider the defendant's failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.383" offset="1851550">I certainly don't think that it would be logical to have to wait for an error of that magnitude before you are entitled as a matter of constitutional law to the relief that was requested in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.308" offset="1911318">If I could get back procedurally, there are some other important points that I think the Court ought to consider with regard to the overall context of the request for the instruction, its importance to this case, and later with regard to the Commonwealth of Kentucky's assertion of harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.587" offset="1980386">One, the judge did overrule defendant's motion for severance.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.824" offset="1997313">That was critical later on due to the extreme paucity of the Commonwealth's evidence of the burglary.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.311" offset="2023331">Furthermore, the prosecutor noted his intention early on, prior to presentation of any evidence, that he was going to impeach the defendant with a prior forgery conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.066" offset="2066277">The defendant in the persistent felony offender stage of this trial, contested that that was in fact a felony conviction and asserted that it was a misdemeanor conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.807" offset="2109222">I think that it is implicit in the defendant's failure to testify in this case that because the judge was going to allow that forgery conviction which he contested to be used as impeachment, that that was a consideration in his failure to testify, so that we are dealing with a reason, a likely inference for his failure to testify that is unrelated to guilt or innocence, and I think that that is an important consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.042" offset="2210264">During the voir dire, the defense counsel was precluded from fully exploring with the jury their feelings, their attitudes about the defendant's failure to testify if in fact he did not testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.783" offset="2265225">Defense counsel was allowed to inquire as to one juror's attitude.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.518" offset="2288108">After exploring that attitude with the juror, defense counsel attempted to explore the rest of the venire's attitude toward that particular consideration--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="545.188" stopTime="566.453">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="545.188" offset="2322799">Sometimes a judge's ruling on that score in that stage is to prevent error getting into the case right at the outset because of the view that that is a good way, a good way to call attention to the failure to testify by having a great deal of discussion about it when they are picking a jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="566.453" offset="2407854">--That may be, Mr. Chief Justice, but I think in this point, the trial judge's response to his attempt to do that was that the jurors have already been instructed that they are to decide this case on the law and the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.694" offset="2460830">This Court specifically repudiated that sort of admonition or instruction in Carter as being a substitute for a full explanation as to the defendant's right to not testify.</text>

            <text syncTime="1066.224" offset="4406953">Trooper Sparks specifically said in response to a question, after advising the defendant of his rights, he did not make any statement whatsoever regarding anything.</text>

            <text syncTime="1085.121" offset="4482499">Detective Owen also testified that the defendant made no statement upon his arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.840" offset="4501411">This was a post-arrest, post-Miranda comment on silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.427" offset="4523772">Detective Courtney went on to make a statement that the only statement that he recalled the defendant making was that he didn't own a gym bag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1105.701" offset="4564837">Of course, Detective Courtney, Detective Owen and Trooper Sparks were all present at the time and neither Trooper Sparks or Detective Owen recalled that statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.371" offset="4599527">Mr. Evans testified as to the fingerprint on the inside of the glass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.544" offset="4624187">Of course, that in and of itself is not either incriminating or exculpatory, depending on the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1128.148" offset="4654593">Mr. Evans did state, though, that fingerprints on the inside of buildings car remain for years, again reminding the Court that Ms. Richardson had stated the defendant had been in her apartment on several occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1141.972" offset="4709973">There was also some evidence from a serologist as to the Group A secretions on some rags that were found and that the victim was a Group A secretor apparently trying to corroborate the victim's story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.767" offset="4781130">Later on the prosecutor made a reference to the fact that the defendant's wife did not testify, in violation of Kentucky statute on spousal immunity, to the effect that had the victim's wife been a Group A secretor she would have been brought forward, which I think is still yet another consideration of the Court, to decide whether or not this error was harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.114" offset="4870469">Finally, David Adams testified, who is her immediate supervisor, that she came back upset from lunch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.367" offset="4895547">He also testified that she was four and a half hours late, that her job performance had been fluctuating in the preceding weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.873" offset="4929506">The defendant then presented evidence simply as to the rape charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.441" offset="4951762">Mr. Marion Bates testified that he was actually in the basement of the defendant's residence where the rape allegedly occurred, and that he heard no noises up there but a record player going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.432" offset="4999723">He specifically recalls leaving that apartment sometime between 20 minutes to 1:00 and 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon to work on his car in the driveway, which was next-door to the defendant's residence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.407" offset="5055625">He also specifically recalled seeing the defendant leave at ten minutes... at 2:00 o'clock or shortly before 2:00 o'clock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.910" offset="5081643">The defendant testified that she was unlawfully imprisoned by the defendant in his apartment from approximately a short time after 12:30 until almost 4:30.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.699" offset="5124797">So there was defense evidence calling into question the victim's account of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1252.605" offset="5152487">Then a Mr. Lambert also testified that he often would show Mr. Bates the basement in the apartment where the defendant lived and where the crime allegedly occurred, didn't recall the specific date, but did corroborate Mr. Bates' testimony to the extent that he said he often shows Mr. Bates that property because it was under renovation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.351" offset="5239423">It was at this point, after all the evidence, that the defendant requested the admonition that was denied--</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.672" offset="5264709">In the prosecutor's closing argument, he made two references to the defendant's failure to contradict the victim's story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1290.544" offset="5304206">I think that at least the Federal Circuit Courts have held that when the defendant is the only person that can contradict testimony, that a reference to the failure to contradict is an indirect reference on the failure to testify, which again is two occurrences of Griffin error.</text>

            <text syncTime="1439.153" offset="5898649">--I think Carter simply stands for the proposition that Mr. Justice Stevens and Mr. Justice Brennan stated in their concurring opinion that whether... I take that back... in Lakeside, that whether or not the jury is going to be given any guidance on the failure to testify is going to be up to counsel and the defendant, and in this particular case, it's obvious that counsel and the defendant requested some jury guidance and were denied it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.024" offset="6022156">I would like to talk briefly about what I think are the constitutional underpinnings of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.428" offset="6047756">Obviously the Court's familiar with Wilson that applied a federal statute precluding comment on a defendant's failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.950" offset="6085895">Wilson was constitutionalized in Griffin.</text>
            <text syncTime="1489.586" offset="6100419">Bruno, which was a precursor to Carter, mandated that upon request, a jury be instructed as to a defendant's failure to testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.208" offset="6142841">Also in Bruno, the Court held that it was not going to apply the harmless error rule to that type of error because it didn't have to do with the mere etiquette of trial rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1510.932" offset="6185787">In Malloy v. Hogan, this court stated that a defendant should suffer no penalty as a result of his exercise of his Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1519.938" offset="6221836">In later cases, particularly Lakeside and Carter, the Court found that when a defendant either requests instruction on the Fifth Amendment, or alternatively, when the Court gives it over the defendant's objection, that all that does is prevent undue speculation, I believe the Court's language was to the effect of allowing a jury to roam at large guided only by its untutored instincts with regard to the meaning of the Fifth Amendment privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.140" offset="6342626">The Court also cited in footnotes that many commentators and many sociologists believe that most persons are going to equate the failure to testify with guilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.548" offset="6396229">Again, in this case, there was an apparent reason for not testifying, not having to do with guilt or innocence, that being the defendant's threatened impeachment with a felony conviction which was at issue in a subsequent proceeding as a persistent felony offender--</text>
            <text syncTime="1580.075" offset="6462371">If I can move on to the procedural bar that was applied by the Kentucky Supreme Court, they basically stated that the defendant asked for the wrong relief, consequently, he is barred from the correct relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.335" offset="6523393">In addition to the fact that I don't think that the defendant asked for relief that was constitutionally improper, I don't think that the state has substantial interest in applying a procedural bar to a Fifth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.595" offset="6584415">This Court took into consideration a Fifth Amendment violation in Brooks v. Tennessee and conceded that the State of Tennessee had a substantial interest in making a defendant testify first in that it precluded the defendant from coloring his testimony due to other defense witnesses testifying first, the defendant changing his testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1636.745" offset="6689010">This Court conceded that that was as substantial interest and stated that was not compelling enough to overcome his Fifth Amendment violation by infringing upon the right of the defendant to decide when he will testify or if he will testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="1649.636" offset="6740628">It also infringed on his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.605" offset="6752435">I think in this particular case, Kentucky has advanced no substantial interest that would overcome the Defendant's Fifth Amendment right to jury guidance on this particular issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.561" offset="6796321">I think Henry v. Mississippi also speaks as to the state's interest in applying a procedural bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="1685.756" offset="6885033">My basic argument is that he was entitled to an admonition, at the very least.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.612" offset="6920455">If I have a few minutes, I would like to address the state's assertion of harmlessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.282" offset="6947204">First, I would like to say that I don't think that this type of error can ever be harmless, based upon the Court's pronouncement in Bruno, based upon the Court's pronouncement in Malloy, that no watered-down version of the privilege applies to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.689" offset="7004778">The significance of Lakeside as to harmlessness is the following: The Court in Lakeside stated that the petitioner Lakeside's assertion that the trial court intruded on his Fifth Amendment privilege by giving an instruction rested on two very doubtful instructions, one, that the jury didn't notice the defendant didn't testify, and two, that the jury would disregard any admonition or instruction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.542" offset="7116164">In this case we are left with the proposition that this Court certainly believes that the jury noticed that the defendant didn't testify, that they were not given the benefit of any jury guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.332" offset="7163393">As I pointed out in my brief, this is not like a Griffin error, which I think the Court believes may be harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.736" offset="7188993">As I stated earlier in my argument, when a Griffin error occurs, even though in Griffin it was a combination of the trial court and the prosecutor, currently Griffin errors are most often committed by a prosecutor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.442" offset="7235805">The relief is an admonition by the trial court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.377" offset="7247508">There is no relief for this type of error in violation of Carter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.566" offset="7272272">Again, it also invades the Sixth Amendment right to counsel which I don't think that the Court should hold harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.886" offset="7297558">There are numerous reasons why if the Court finds that it can be susceptible to harmless error analysis, it should not be harmless in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1796.272" offset="7327129">One, the court's refusal to sever the burglary charge and the ESP charge, of which there was very little or scant evidence, the limitation of voir dire, the two Doyle errors by Detective Sparks and Detective Owen, the Griffin errors in closing argument by the prosecutor, the violation of the spousal immunity privilege by the prosecutor in closing argument, the fact that petitioner's failure to testify was not related to guilt or innocense, the fact that petitioner's defense as to the rape charge tended to raise a reasonable doubt as to his presence at the scene of the crime, and finally, that if this Court's statement in Lakeside and later in Carter is true that an inference that the jury might draw from failure to testify as to the defendant's guilt is inevitable, then certainly it occurred in this case by virtue of the fact that the jury convicted this defendant of a burglary charge where there was certainly no evidence of an entry other than one fingerprint in an apartment where he had been before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1861.582" offset="7588353">If this case had been tried alone, I think that the defendant would have been entitled to a directed verdict as a matter of law on that kind of evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="2832.036" offset="11470149">They certainly must follow the advice and caution of the trial court, but I believe in Kentucky that all instructions are presented in a unified manner, whether it be all oral or all written, and in my practice, I have never seen any request for an oral instruction at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.948" offset="11545800">They are always written, and they are submitted in the same way and then made available to the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.501" offset="11572027">If this Court should decide that Carter does compel an admonition in addition to an instruction, then Kentucky requests that the case be remanded for determination as to whether or not that error were harmless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.077" offset="11626361">The state court did not decide that issue because it determined that there was no error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.963" offset="11645901">Any discussion of harmless error by the Kentucky Supreme Court would have been advisory at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.133" offset="11670561">Petition suggests that the Kentucky court would not hold the error harmless and there is no need to remand, but we would respectfully disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.637" offset="11704624">The charges against James were for rape, burglary and receiving stolen property, arising from incidents within a two-week time frame and all involving the same victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.094" offset="11742450">The defense as to the rape was basically mistaken identity or fabrication, and similar defenses, mistaken identity or no involvement or alibi.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.050" offset="11782260">Defense counsel portrayed the victim as seeking an excuse for her absence that afternoon to satisfy her employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.737" offset="11816951">Witnesses were presented to argue that had the events taken place as she testified, they would have been seen crossing the short yard, and in fact, petitioner was seen leaving his apartment at some time when the victim testified that she was being held inside at gunpoint.</text>
            <text syncTime="2937.034" offset="11890198">This testimony of the defense witnesses was based on recollection of common events on routine days many months earlier, and the testimony as to the timing was not inconsistent with the fact that the victim was not seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.579" offset="11960311">The testimony on the timeframes put Mr. Bates in the basement at about the same time the yard crossing occurred, and his statement was that he stayed out in the yard sometimes until four.</text>
            <text syncTime="2967.720" offset="12012974">The victim said she left at 4:30.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.105" offset="12026453">So it was not at all surprising that she was not seen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.926" offset="12045784">There were not the numerous adverse comments as there were in Chapman, nor was there an adverse instruction, and counsel repeatedly... defense counsel repeatedly said there is no evidence on this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2988.233" offset="12094998">In cases such as this where there is merely a possibility of misinterpretation, we submit the weight of evidence is more significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.053" offset="12126241">The prosecution presented an unequivocal identification of the victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.557" offset="12148288">James' positive fingerprint was found on the back door of the house, and I believe the victim's testimony was that he had come to use the phone, and the trial record reflects the phone is in the front room.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.863" offset="12193532">Also, Mr. James, I believe the testimony reflects, was six feet eleven inches tall, and this fingerprint was on the bottom inside of a glass storm door after it was pushed out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.070" offset="12242329">Also, there were prompt reports to the police corroborating the victim's testimony, and there was medical evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.742" offset="12268974">Mr. James had in his possession within a few hours of the rape cloth strips that were impregnated with the saliva of a blood type... a secretor with a blood type similar to that of the victim's, and also in his possession was the pistol stolen from her apartment two weeks earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="3050.204" offset="12342848">We believe it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a verdict of guilty and request this Court to affirm the Kentucky Supreme Court decision finding that there was no error, or if it finds that it is error, to remand it for an appropriate decision by the Kentucky Court.</text>
