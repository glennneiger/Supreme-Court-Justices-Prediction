          <turn speaker="laurence_h_tribe" startTime="76.916" stopTime="595.103">
            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="76.916" offset="461359">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="82.302" offset="482884">This case tests the limits of federal judicial intervention into the legislative and the judicial processes of a state that has grappled since entering the Union with a land oligopoly traceable to its monarchy, very much as the original 13 colonies struggled with large landholdings traceable to the English crown.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.106" offset="606077">Now, Hawaii's legislature attacked that problem by using eminent domain with fair compensation, the approach that the Appellees themselves preferred for federal tax reasons, but an approach that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denounced as forbidden taking from one private party to benefit another, as though the Land Reform Act somehow left the land market of Hawaii itself completely unchanged and merely substituted a favored group of lessees for the Bishop Estate and other supposedly disfavored owners as the ruling oligopolist of the Hawaiian Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.272" offset="806802">Now, I should like to begin by showing how wholly untenable that view is.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.212" offset="838567">The Appellees talk repeatedly, as did the Ninth Circuit, of appeasing the desires for land owning of the landless majority.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.068" offset="881930">As I think it will become clear, that radically distorts the aims of the legislation before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.256" offset="910665">But it does, perhaps inadvertently, hit upon a very fundamental truth, and that is that people everywhere greatly prefer to own not only the home they live in and invest in and build, but also the land on which that home stands.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.635" offset="984226">Now, of course there are unusual circumstances... and his Court has seen some of them... that might lead a perfectly well functioning land market to separate surface from subsurface ownership, to separate the ownership of the home on top of the land from the ownership of what's under the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.481" offset="1067609">For example, in the case of Pennsylvania Coal against Mahon, where the land contained valuable minerals, the perfectly natural development was for a few large mining companies to end up owning the mining rights under very large tracts of land, and selling only surface rights to a large number of individual homeowners.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.747" offset="1164680">But of course, in most places, both in the continental United States and in Hawaii, a normally functioning competitive market would never yield so bizarre a pattern, where literally tens of thousands of individual homeowners are forced to build on top of land that they must rent half a century at a gulp, despite the fact that they want to buy that land at what a court would approve as fair market value and are able to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.539" offset="1315877">The situation is that a small number of owners simply refuse to sell, and indeed those owners, as the record unmistakeably shows, keep even more land off the residential market altogether, despite the great demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.132" offset="1370211">Now, one might ask, why did this happen in Hawaii if it doesn't happen elsewhere?</text>
            <text syncTime="310.202" offset="1394453">The legislature asked that question and, after extensive hearings, reached the conclusions elaborately articulated in 1967 and reaffirmed in 1975 that there were in Hawaii crucial artificial deterrents to the normal functioning of the market, deterrents to the landowners selling the land that those who lived on top of it wanted to buy.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.818" offset="1496957">Those deterrents included trust indentures inherited from the Hawaiian monarchs.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.222" offset="1518587">They included as a very practical and crucial matter federal tax disincentives, because the IRS made very clear to the major landowners that were they to sell in large quantities they would be treated as ordinary dealers in real estate and would be taxed at ordinary income rates on virtually 100 percent of the proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.503" offset="1607717">Now, that alone would not produce this bizarre pattern were it not also for the shortage of nearby competitors with land to sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.526" offset="1647841">That is, whatever the disincentives of the large landowners, if there were adjacent landowners who for some reason were perfectly happy to meet consumer preferences for a house on top of the land and the land beneath as well, then this pattern would not have developed.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.904" offset="1717326">But here, as the legislature found, there was a shortage of alternative competitors, and indeed, unlike some of the early American colonies, those that did not directly break up major landholdings from the crown but nonetheless found the holdings dissolved through natural forces because people could just cross the border and go to a place where they could buy the land under their homes, that wasn't exactly available because crossing the border plunks you in the middle of the ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.674" offset="1836340">So that was the situation that the legislature confronted, and it found specifically that this land oligopoly would not just naturally fade away; that indeed it would persist because of these artificial deterrents to sale; that it would keep forcing up land prices and lease rents and the cost of living generally, with grave economic and social consequences for the entire state, unless the oligopoly was somehow broken up by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.911" offset="1965385">Now, it was against that background that the Hawaii Land Reform Act was passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.049" offset="1985865">As a brief reading of it will make plain to the Court, it does not simply substitute a favored for a disfavored group of owners.</text>
            <text syncTime="467.071" offset="2022019">What it does is create a neutral mechanism for identifying where it is that the land oligopoly was actually causing demonstrable, palpable market failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.914" offset="2085339">The concept of this Act is that such market failure is identifiable where large development tracts are available only in the form of long-term leasehold of the underlying land, despite the willingness and ability of a sufficiently large number of small lot lessees to buy individual lots at fair prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.183" offset="2198397">That is, where you have lessees who want to buy at fair prices, but all they can get is long-term leaseholds in part of a large tract, there is a demonstrable market failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.955" offset="2241552">Now, how would a legislature try to figure out when that had occurred?</text>
            <text syncTime="526.943" offset="2261509">Well, presumably it would wait for applications by lessees to say, we're able and willing to buy, but we're unable to do it because the sellers will not sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.215" offset="2298499">And that's the way this Act works.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.334" offset="2302992">That is, a number of lessees, 25 or half the number in the tract, whichever is less, file an application with the Hawaii Housing Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.690" offset="2340399">That application is a signal that the market has indeed failed, as the legislature predicted it would throughout the islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.728" offset="2376552">At that point the Act relies on a state agency, the Hawaii Housing Authority, to decide whether or not condemning all or part of the tract in question would serve the public purpose of creating a competitive land market, and if the answer to that question is yes... and I suppose that it ordinarily would be, but one can't tell because this is a facial attack on the law and the law has only begun to be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.482" offset="2499641">If the answer to that is yes, the Hawaii Housing Authority takes all or part of the tract... it decides which part... by eminent domain.</text>

            <text syncTime="743.617" offset="3128148">The law says, for instance, that the agency can't use this power to earn profit on the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.921" offset="3149359">But the point is that the statute makes it plain that the agency is empowered to lease the land or to sell it to the tenant.</text>

            <text syncTime="760.145" offset="3194290">Possibly.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.311" offset="3198887">Obviously, if the Act works as intended I wouldn't expect that to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.399" offset="3219263">But it's important to see that the Act structurally has three features that are very different from what the Appellees would suggest and that make the Hawaii Housing Authority anything but a vapid conduit.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.690" offset="3268477">First of all, it is suggested by the Appellees that the Housing Authority may take only those lots for which the individual occupant has filed an application.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.831" offset="3309019">That isn't true.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.265" offset="3314766">It may take any or all of the lots in the tract.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.783" offset="3324797">Second, they suggest that it must sell the lot to the occupant, and, although it probably would end up doing that, that's not a requirement of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.972" offset="3353532">And third, they suggest that the Hawaii Housing Authority must pay owners with funds supplied by the buyers rather than with public funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.709" offset="3388536">Again, the Act makes clear that purchasing these lots with public funds is another option.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.232" offset="3414659">Now, any reasonable legislature that chose to do that would presumably find a mechanism.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="820.886" stopTime="828.973">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="820.886" offset="3437228">Do you think the agency could just hang on until they can get a better price than the valuation put on in the condemnation proceeding?</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="828.973" offset="3469620">Were it to do that, I think it might violate the prescription against running the system for profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.110" offset="3486130">That is, the statute says that it's not supposed to be used to generate surplus revenue for the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.197" offset="3510476">And if the agency does, as the Act I think implicitly contemplates, end up transferring title to the current occupant, presumably any rational system would tax the occupant with the benefit of then becoming the owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.773" offset="3572752">And so the fact that ordinarily the purchase price would come from the occupant is what one would expect.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.677" offset="3592396">In fact, let me say that I don't stress the mechanical details to suggest that the Act would not ordinarily work much as they suppose, but if it does it simply means that the legislature was correct in its assessment that once the tight grip of the oligopoly in this case was broken, then one would see the transactions flow naturally.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.507" offset="3683720">That is, then one would see those who lived on the land, who wanted to buy the land under their feet, could afford to do so, would simply do so.</text>

            <text syncTime="1497.103" offset="6142051">And in general, I suppose their whole philosophy, the philosophy of the Appellees in this case, is that the involvement of private entities, whether to trigger the Act or as the possible owners of the property once the Act has done its job, creates a terribly suspect situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1685.209" offset="6894482">Let me say as to Pullman abstention, if there are any doubts about the public purpose, it is the courts of Hawaii in the now pending case that should answer the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.548" offset="6931890">But that pending case shows you precisely how Younger abstention also was mandated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1701.488" offset="6959684">That is, in that case a trial on just compensation was held in November of '82, a trial on public use was held in 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.825" offset="6993016">But for all practical purposes, once the Hawaii Housing Authority decided that it would serve a public purpose to take the Kamiloiki tract on March 30, 1979, that case was pending and under Younger there should have been abstention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.103" offset="7058113">And in fact we have argued, I think without any meaningful rebuttal from the Appellees, that as early as February 22nd, 1979, six days before this federal complaint was filed, they had every opportunity to present to the Hawaii Housing Authority all of their constitutional objections, and they did so in a letter, in a letter which urged it on constitutional grounds to go for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.100" offset="7146094">Now, it seems to me that when that happens, for this Court to reach the merits is wholly unnecessary, although as a matter of judicial economy, feeling that the state has unjustly been dragged through years of litigation, if it is clear to the Court, as I think it could well be, that this law is obviously valid on its face, the Court might well say so.</text>

            <text syncTime="3689.180" offset="14910417">The circle is this: It's okay to take this property, but you need a public purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.482" offset="14927658">So Justice White asks: Why isn't spreading ownership a public purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="3730.757" offset="15076765">As Justice O'Connor perceives and as Justice Stevens' question I think indicates, this is just like other forms of divestiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.911" offset="15105290">But their answer is divestiture is regulation, it's not taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.213" offset="15118561">I think this Court really is concerned with realities and not just labels.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.601" offset="15140085">The reason that taking is used rather than regulation is that they had the lobbying power to avoid the regulatory route.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.373" offset="15175194">And when they point out, more or less equating themselves with the government, that the government too has a lot of land, why doesn't it sell it, I think I understand what people in Hawaii mean when they say that these landowners are Hawaii's other government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.483" offset="15235589">When they also say that this statute is unprecedented, that no legislature has ever been so bold, I am reminded of the Virginia legislature in 1779 which broke up landholdings in a way parallel to this, of the Connecticut legislature in 1793, and of Pennsylvania in 1799.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.796" offset="15320853">This is not unprecedented action.</text>
            <text syncTime="3793.348" offset="15327122">And even if you take the pigeonholing approach of insisting that it be compared explicitly with other contemporary exercises of the taking power, it doesn't look all that unprecedented to me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.239" offset="15378636">It's not really different from Pennsylvania Coal v. Mahon, where property rights were, this Court held, in effect taken from the owner of the mining rights under the land and transferred to the surface owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3820.498" offset="15435687">What followed from that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.065" offset="15441957">That there was no power to do it because it went from A to B?</text>
            <text syncTime="3825.985" offset="15457630">No, all that followed was that you had to compensate, and there is no challenge--</text>

            <label>Mr. Laurence H. Tribe</label>
            <text syncTime="3833.723" offset="15488559">--I suppose the condemned, though, might have been happy to have the law wholly invalidated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3840.127" offset="15514159">The brief I think urged also invalidation, and the Court made clear, I think, that if there were compensation that's all that would be required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.733" offset="15540595">In fact, the key line in Justice Holmes' opinion is that the State of Pennsylvania must not take a constitutional shortcut, it must pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3855.421" offset="15575390">Now, when the State of Hawaii decided to use eminent domain, to avoid the constitutional shortcut of the Maryland type law that required the inclusion of options to purchase, it's remarkable that then the Appellees turn around and say, because we're using eminent domain, with its guarantees of compensation, that now you should strike the law down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.716" offset="15652503">And it's remarkable that they say that because those people who occupy the land will, of all things, end up paying for it, that that makes this law unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="3883.922" offset="15689388">We don't think this Court should so hold.</text>
