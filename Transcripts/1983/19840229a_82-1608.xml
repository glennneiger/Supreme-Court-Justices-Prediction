            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="149024">We will hear arguments next in South-Central Timber Development against LeResche.</text>

            <label>Mr. LeRoy Eugene DeVeaux</label>
            <text syncTime="17.942" offset="220704">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="21.444" offset="234706">The issues in this case are basic commerce clause issues: Can a state, in selling natural resources to private parties, insist that those resources be processed before the resources can be shipped in interstate or foreign commerce?</text>
            <text syncTime="44.631" offset="327493">Can Congress' consent to such a restraint be implied from a U.S. Forest Service policy governing federally owned natural resources?</text>
            <text syncTime="60.080" offset="389246">The facts of this case are clear and they are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.254" offset="414010">In 1980 the State of Alaska noticed, sent out prospectuses and sample contracts offering to sell 49 million board-feet of mixed spruce and hemlock in Icy Bay, Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.426" offset="486631">A special condition to the contract in this case stated that before the logs out of this sale could be shipped in interstate or foreign commerce they must be primarily processed.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.566" offset="555280">The State reason for primary processing is to encourage in-state construction of lumber mills and to support existing lumber mills within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.610" offset="623408">South-Central, a bidder and a potential bidder in this case, cuts, sells, and ships logs in interstate and foreign commerce, particularly, in fact virtually all of them, in foreign commerce to Japan, and that is noted even in the state's brief at page 34.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.428" offset="726644">At the time of this sale, South-Central did not at that time have a functioning mill within the State of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.443" offset="758722">The first question that probably should be addressed is whether Congress has consented to state activity which would otherwise be a violation of the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.911" offset="812639">The district court, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the State of Alaska in this Court have all conceded that Congress has not expressly consented to the primary manufacturing or primary processing requirement at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.336" offset="898320">Instead, the Ninth Circuit created a novel doctrine of implied consent, saying in effect that federal consent can be implied from Forest Service policies governing only national forests.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.438" offset="978673">With all due respect to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, that is simply wrong and this Court has never so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.855" offset="1016394">The Solicitor General's office in this argument... in its argument will deal primarily with the consent question and with the foreign commerce question.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.923" offset="1064668">Under traditional commerce clause analysis, this case would be easily dealt with.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.932" offset="1120675">We have a case of requiring in-state processing or in-state manufacturing before an item of commerce can be shipped out of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.419" offset="1166650">Traditionally this Court has held that those kinds of regulations, those kinds of requirements, are virtually per se unconstitutional and a violation of the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.812" offset="1236240">But the state raised an issue, and has continually raised that issue until this very time, that it fits within a narrow exception, a doctrine called the market participation exception to commerce clause scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.163" offset="1305622">We must first look at what this case is not.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.596" offset="1327355">It is not a case of a state manufacturing a good.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.279" offset="1342088">It is not a state just concerned with interstate commerce, but predominantly foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.476" offset="1386915">It is not a simple refusal to deal or to choose who one is to deal with.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.729" offset="1415858">It is not a case where the state has taken any great risk, used its own industry or foresight, or expended any great labor or entered into a complex process.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.765" offset="1496002">It is not a case of police power for health, welfare, the safety of its citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.667" offset="1523692">It is not a case of a traditional governmental function or state sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.233" offset="1557860">It is not a case of cleaning up roads or building public projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.169" offset="1585654">And it's not a case where the state created any market.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.651" offset="1607597">The State of Alaska is simply not a market participant in any normal or theoretical sense of the word.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.901" offset="1660573">Alaska argues in its brief that it's simply a seller of timber, and you can find that in their brief at page 28.</text>

            <text syncTime="393.650" offset="1723581">Doesn't Alaska own the timber we're talking about?</text>

            <text syncTime="399.043" offset="1745106">Yes, it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.423" offset="1746673">What it's saying in effect by saying that is that it's a simple seller of timber when it requires someone to process it downstream.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.241" offset="1785961">If they were a simple seller of timber, Your Honor, would they forego over 90 percent of the value of that timber in cash for some political or social function for the state that no seller of timber in the private marketplace would do?</text>

            <label>Mr. LeRoy Eugene DeVeaux</label>
            <text syncTime="443.743" offset="1923992">In the state's brief, in its appendix, pages... I believe it's page A-8... when later looking to sell the same timber the state forester, the state expert in this area, states in numbered paragraph 3:</text>
            <text syncTime="469.360" offset="2026392">"Increased Revenue. "</text>
            <text syncTime="471.502" offset="2034960">"The revenue to the state by not requiring primary manufacture will be substantially increased from $216,000 to $2,440,000. "</text>
            <text syncTime="493.087" offset="2121269">And as that sale has been completed, the state made a woefully small estimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.622" offset="2155437">In fact, it increased more than twice the amount that they estimated.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.285" offset="2178111">So we're talking about something in the neighborhood between $4 million and $6 million.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="512.788" offset="2200159">Could Alaska sell its timber without the requirement and turn around and use the extra money to somehow subsidize in-state processing?</text>

            <label>Mr. LeRoy Eugene DeVeaux</label>
            <text syncTime="524.406" offset="2246552">I think they somehow could do that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="527.669" stopTime="530.230">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="527.669" offset="2259613">Well then, why can't they do it this way?</text>

          <turn speaker="leroy_eugene_deveaux" startTime="530.230" stopTime="581.134">
            <label>Mr. LeRoy Eugene DeVeaux</label>
            <text syncTime="530.230" offset="2269853">Because to encourage in-state processing rather than discouraging business from exporting logs in the round are entirely different matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.040" offset="2329099">This state has always looked... this Court has always looked with great scrutiny and care where states have required some kind of activity to be taken within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.048" offset="2385210">But there is nothing to be said that a state can't encourage industrial development, and using money to encourage it is one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="567.095" offset="2417393">Building a barrier at the border is another.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.088" offset="2437351">I think those are entirely different matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.590" offset="2451352">Did that answer your question, Your Honor?</text>

          <turn speaker="leroy_eugene_deveaux" startTime="587.559" stopTime="811.954">
            <label>Mr. LeRoy Eugene DeVeaux</label>
            <text syncTime="587.559" offset="2499208">I'm sure that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.068" offset="2505269">I hope it answers your question, I should say.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.168" offset="2513628">They are not in any sense of the word what a normal market participant would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="602.578" offset="2559290">No business would give away 90 percent of its value in its natural resource that it was selling for some social end.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.624" offset="2603489">In fact, Justice Powell noted in his dissent in Reeves that states are oftimes and will often look to different ends than a normal market participant would look at or a private enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.387" offset="2686559">Let me make the point more precisely, maybe.</text>
            <text syncTime="636.498" offset="2694918">In a free market environment with this particular resource, logs, timber, if you will, logs are hauled from where they are cut down to a mill site, and they are put in at one end of the mill and they come out the other end of the mill as finished lumber.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.772" offset="2772031">All the lumber that can be made out of that log that the market needs at that time based on that particular piece of wood will be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="666.368" offset="2814454">Not so with what the state has done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.672" offset="2831695">They've created an artificial second milling.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.523" offset="2847055">In other words, instead of having a one-step process we have now a two-step process.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.037" offset="2865132">The logs now come into mill and are cut up into chunks of wood 8-3/4 inches thick, and then have to be shipped to another mill where the finished products are made.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.036" offset="2921138">I cannot see under those kinds of facts how the state can say they are simple market participants, particularly when you take and do this two-step tier that does not exist in the normal marketplace, that the value of the log is less when it comes out of the first tier than it was when it went in, and that I refer the Court to the Kenai Lumber briefs in the lower court which in fact say that is true, and they are an Intervenor on the side of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.542" offset="3087173">That is why the price differential is so great.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.745" offset="3107966">The logs are worth so much less and so much more difficult to market after they have had this primary manufacturing.</text>
            <text syncTime="749.503" offset="3146941">All this is clear from a memorandum attached to the state's brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.087" offset="3177347">Again referring to the state's addendum or appendix to their brief, page 5, we're discussing primary manufacture:</text>
            <text syncTime="771.737" offset="3235966">"Primary manufacturing policy limits the options of the logging industry in marketing their products on the world market. "</text>
            <text syncTime="779.212" offset="3265850">Further, on page 8 of that same gentleman's memorandum to the state he says:</text>
            <text syncTime="788.549" offset="3303153">"Since the sale is appraised to be competitive, anyone in the private sector can bid on it. "</text>
            <text syncTime="795.693" offset="3331783">"This gives a much larger segment of the forest products industry an opportunity to bid on that sale. "</text>
            <text syncTime="803.969" offset="3364802">And then it follows in the very next paragraph, again refers to the rate differential in plus.</text>

            <text syncTime="1239.574" offset="5107274">We briefed all of the issues in this case, including the market participant doctrine, and support South-Central's position on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.981" offset="5148861">But since the Court of Appeals did not decide that issue, our primary interest is in the validity of the implicit approval doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.308" offset="5194209">But we are in agreement with South-Central on this case not falling within the market participant doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.834" offset="5224302">On the implicit approval theory, we think that the reasons for requiring a rule of express Congressional consent are fairly obvious and they're well demonstrated by this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1281.062" offset="5273204">Without such a rule, the courts are left to guess from a welter of federal enactments what Congress had in mind on a subject that it hasn't spoken about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.618" offset="5315417">Here the Court of Appeals looked to federal policy relating to federal timber on national forest lands, recognizing, as the state itself recognizes, that there is no Congressional policy for state timber on state-owned lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.761" offset="5388038">The Court of Appeals looked at the federal policy for federal logs and concluded it was sufficiently similar to the state policy that that was implicitly a validation of the state policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.247" offset="5433909">But what the Court of Appeals didn't do and what its implicit approval theory would necessarily require is that a court comb through the entire U.S. Code and probably all U.S. treaties as well to find out whether there are other federal policies that are or are not consistent with the state policy that a state is attempting to uphold in the absence of express Congressional consent.</text>

            <label>Ms. Kathryn A. Oberly</label>
            <text syncTime="1603.751" offset="6563966">Today the policy applies to all of the states west of the hundredth meridian, including Alaska, although in Alaska it's by regulation and in the other lower 48 states it's by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1617.372" offset="6618510">And today the policy is basically to ensure jobs for Americans, but it's on a national collective basis that Congress has made that decision, rather than on a single state protectionist basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.072" offset="6685279">And this Court has repeatedly invalidated single state protectionist legislation when a state has attempted to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.728" offset="6711924">There's no reason to assume that Congress would approve of the same thing, the same action by a state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.472" offset="6738882">When Congress makes that judgment, it's taking the entire national welfare into account, as is properly its function under the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.697" offset="6771796">When a state makes that judgment, it's only considering its own parochial interests, and Congress may or may not find those compatible with the national welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.553" offset="6807218">That's why we think it is quite important that there be express Congressional sanction for something that would otherwise clearly be a burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.398" offset="6842536">There may be some inconsistency here, in that the Federal Government is doing something that on its face appears harmonious with what Alaska's doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.214" offset="6885795">But at least it's a decision at the federal level by the representatives of the entire nation that that's the policy they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.369" offset="6918500">In Alaska's case of Alaska's regulation, it's a decision by one state to oust from competition residents or corporations attempting to compete within Alaska who are not represented in Alaska, and it has its principal effect here, which makes it even more serious in our view, on foreign commerce since 90 percent of Alaska's timber is exported to Japan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1719.138" offset="7025497">The subject of log export restraints is a constant subject of negotiation between the United States and Japan, between the U.S. Trade Representative and Japan, and something those two countries discuss on a government to government level.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.129" offset="7089445">It's not something that the United States Trade Representative's negotiations are helped by having states add.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.153" offset="7121628">Even if their voices are harmonious, they're still a second voice rather than the Federal Government speaking with one voice, as this Court has clearly said must be the case in matters affecting foreign affairs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.902" offset="7172619">So that if Congress chooses, knowing all the things it's weighing in the balance, to have both a policy of in-state processing for federal timber and to be against export restraints, it does so with full awareness of the needs of the entire country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.465" offset="7254853">When Alaska makes that decision, it's just simply not the part of our federal union that the Constitution has entrusted that decisionmaking process to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.091" offset="7297380">I might also add that two important points in our view are that, in response to the district court decision in this very case, Congress has been asked by the western states to pass legislation that would specifically authorize exactly what Alaska now does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.464" offset="7378777">It has not passed that legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1810.038" offset="7389122">To take from... this is not simply a case of Congressional silence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.531" offset="7415140">It's a case where Congress is fully aware of the issue and yet it hasn't acted.</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald W. Lorensen</label>
            <text syncTime="1860.509" offset="7590996">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1863.661" offset="7603640">I want to stress a few facts for the Court and then outline briefly the three legal points which I will be urging upon the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.317" offset="7638226">The requirement of primary manufacture on public lands in Alaska has been in existence for over 50 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.232" offset="7665915">It was adopted at a time when the State of Alaska was not a state; it was a federal territory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.846" offset="7688381">But the purpose at that time was to encourage the development of a timber processing industry in the remote coastal regions of Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.801" offset="7724221">That policy for primary manufacture in the national forests in Alaska continues today under regulations of the Forest Service which have the explicit purpose of keeping and assuring that there is a continued existence of a forest processing industry in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.346" offset="7802379">The effect of the federal policy has been at least twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.728" offset="7819933">First of all, it has provided an economic basis for the development of communities in rural southeast Alaska; and secondly, coupled with the primary manufacture requirement imposed on other federal timber exports in the Pacific Northwest, it has had the effect of creating a market for processed timber with a number of Pacific Rim nations for both pulp and for cants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.977" offset="7936857">Since statehood, Alaska has itself enunciated a primary manufacture requirement for sales from state land.</text>
            <text syncTime="1956.674" offset="7975623">The purpose of the state requirement is identical to that of the federal requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.505" offset="7994954">It is to keep the timber industry in the remote areas of coastal Alaska in operation and to keep the communities which depend on them both socially and economically in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1973.173" offset="8041661">The three points which I will cover today are: First of all, that we do believe the Ninth Circuit was correct when it found... impliedly found Congressional consent to the state's primary manufacture requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.843" offset="8096309">Secondly--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="1988.063" stopTime="2007.367">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1988.063" offset="8101220">Do you think that kind of... that consent which you say Congress gave would cover an Alaska statute that related not only to state-owned timber, but to privately owned timber?</text>

            <text syncTime="2009.228" offset="8185857">It simply applies to public timber in this case, state as well as federal timber.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2017.422" offset="8218666">And that if Alaska attempted to require that privately owned timber be processed before it was exported, you think that would be a burden on commerce that would be illegal?</text>

          <turn speaker="ronald_w_lorensen" startTime="2030.342" stopTime="2081.155">
            <label>Mr. Ronald W. Lorensen</label>
            <text syncTime="2030.342" offset="8270389">There would certainly be an argument that there is a burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.003" offset="8280942">Whether it would be illegal or not, obviously we would argue in a different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.407" offset="8298601">I think under the various natural gas cases that have been decided that, unless Alaska could show some independent policy power or safety justification for the requirement, that it probably would not be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.014" offset="8344995">Even if there has not been Congressional consent to the state's requirement here, we believe that the state is in fact a market participant and is therefore not subject to the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.562" offset="8407271">And thirdly, even if ultimately it is determined that the state is not a market participant, but is subject to the commerce clause, we believe that the primary manufacture requirement imposed by the State of Alaska satisfies traditional commerce clause analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2137.492" offset="8698902">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.771" offset="8704022">That is a term of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="2140.444" offset="8710709">The Petitioners and both the Solicitor General have argued with respect to this question of implied consent that this Court has required in a number of cases that this consent must be express and clear, and they have cited cases for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.128" offset="8801511">But the real inquiry that this Court has applied in the past, and we believe is the inquiry which should continue to be applied, is whether or not... well, the question is really what did Congress have in mind, what was its intent in a particular area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.259" offset="8862010">And we think that, therefore, the issue is not whether Congress properly expressed its intent, but really the underlying question is in fact what its intent was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2188.243" offset="8901925">For instance, I can give the Court a couple of examples where Congress has not itself spoken clearly, but yet where this Court has approved what would otherwise be considered a burden on interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.732" offset="8943930">Last year in this Court's decision in the White case, the Court approved the City of Boston's requirement for local employment when it was challenged with respect to the use of federal funds on the grounds that there was a federal regulation adopted by a federal agency which required that preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2218.743" offset="9023969">There was no express Congressional requirement or permission for the preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.046" offset="9045181">Similarly, in the case of Marion versus Hicarilla Apache Tribe, this Court found consent as the result of a scheme of federal checkpoints established by federal officials, and again not something that was established expressly by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.578" offset="9115293">The Ninth Circuit examined the record and the legislation and the legislative history and determined, upon taking them as a whole, that Congress was aware of the requirement of primary manufacture for public timber, that it had determined that such a policy was in the national interest, and that it intended that the State of Alaska as well as the Federal Government be able to impose primary manufacture in selling its timber.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.427" offset="9218634">Now, despite assertions by both the Petitioners and the Solicitor General to the contrary, there can be no doubt that Congress does and has expressly and clearly indicated its view that a primary manufacture requirement for national forest timber in Alaska is in both the nation's and Alaska's interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.559" offset="9303166">Although we have not referred to it as clearly as we might have in our brief, the clearest and most recent expression of Congressional concern regarding the local interests at stake in Alaska and the health of the timber industry is the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.262" offset="9382056">That can be found as Public Law 96-481, and we would refer the Court in particular to Sections 705 and 706.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.469" offset="9418836">Those sections call upon the United States Forest Service to monitor and report to Congress on an annual basis on the timber supply and demand that is available in southeast Alaska for the purpose of ensuring that there is an approximately 450 million board foot availability of public timber, national timber, which is available to dependent industry... and "dependent industry" is the language of the statute... in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.758" offset="9535969">Funds are provided by Congress in Section 705 for that express purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2352.211" offset="9557808">A further record of Congress' concern and its purpose in adopting these provisions in the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act can be found in House Report 96-97, Part 1 at page 504, and Senate Report 96-413 at page 399.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.335" offset="9638265">There both the House and Senate Committees respectively describe that maintaining the timber industry employment in southeast Alaska was</text>

            <text syncTime="2964.294" offset="12006108">The position of both the Petitioners and the Solicitor General with regard to explicit consent causes us to be a little bit concerned in that it creates what we think is a troubling asymmetry with traditional preemption analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.284" offset="12074131">On the one hand it is argued with respect to commerce clause that in order for a power to be granted to a state it must be expressly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2989.880" offset="12108508">On the other hand, when the question is whether or not a power is being withdrawn from a state, the traditional analysis which this Congress has applied is: first, is there express preemption; but secondly, can the Court reasonably imply preemption in a particular situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.329" offset="12166291">I'm not sure at all why the rule should be any different with respect to inference as to the particular action or intent of Congress when we are talking about granting a power as opposed to taking one away.</text>
            <text syncTime="3015.028" offset="12209132">What is the danger of inquiring into Congressional intent in commerce clause cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.382" offset="12246539">We submit that there is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3026.805" offset="12256152">Unlike a number of other areas of constitutional jurisprudence, the Court's put... the Court's decision on the question of Congressional consent is not final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.371" offset="12298471">If Congress disagrees with the Court's decision and believes that the Court has misinterpreted its intent, Congress obviously can take steps to rectify the misinterpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.471" offset="12342879">Even if the Court concludes that Congress has not consented to Alaska's primary manufacture requirement, we believe that Alaska is a market participant and therefore exempt from commerce clause scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.821" offset="12404214">We are as much traders in timbers as South Dakota was in cement in Reeves, as Maryland was in hulk cars in Alexandria Scrap, or as the City of Boston or the City of Camden are in public construction in either White or Camden.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.770" offset="12476103">The applicable inquiry as to whether or not the state is a market participant was stated by the Court last year in White, and that is whether or not Alaska's primary manufacturing requirement covers a discrete, identifiable class of economic activity in which Alaska is a major participant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3099.174" offset="12545693">Alaska satisfies that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.383" offset="12558546">As the owner of the timber which is sold subject to the primary manufacture requirement, Alaska is clearly a major participant in the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3110.891" offset="12592505">Additionally, the primary manufacture requirement is imposed, as I indicated earlier, by the terms of the contract on the sale itself, so that there is in fact in this relationship, with respect to this requirement, formal privity of contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.201" offset="12657811">As has already been brought out, because the state imposes this primary manufacture requirement the state does receive a lower price for its timber than it would receive if it permitted timber to be exported in the round.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.590" offset="12715280">The difference between those prices operates in effect as a subsidy by the state or a subsidy by the Federal Government, because the Federal Government takes the same reduced price for its timber as a result of its requirement, as a subsidy by the state in support of the continued existence of an Alaska timber processing industry and the communities which depend on it both economically and socially.</text>
            <text syncTime="3166.276" offset="12814128">I think in an abstract sense we might characterize this subsidy as an alternate and presumably far better and more desirable form of federal and state welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.876" offset="12864492">The Petitioner claims that we are not a market participant because we provide this subsidy, and therefore we cannot be treated as a private trader.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.591" offset="12899287">But the Petitioner we believe is misconstruing the thrust of the market participant inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.263" offset="12917991">The correct inquiry is whether we are acting like any private trader similarly situated could act, not whether we act with the same profit motives that the private trader does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.949" offset="12960727">The Petitioner has made reference to findings of the state forester, but I would like to make clear the state forester does not have the job or the responsibility of making social policy in Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3214.459" offset="13006807">That the rule suggested by Petitioner is incorrect can be quickly seen by considering the activity of the involved governments in the other market participant cases which this Court has addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3228.196" offset="13061768">In Alexandria Scrap, what private trader would pay more for a wreck than it's worth?</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.960" offset="13084861">In the Reeves case, what private trader would allocate scarce cement on any basis other than price?</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.265" offset="13106072">And in the White case, what private trader would make a decision as to whom to hire on a construction project other than who was the most qualified for the job?</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.400" offset="13138568">Both the Petitioner and the Solicitor General have suggested that there is something constitutionally significant about state-owned natural resources which requires denying a state market participant status when it is disposing of those resources.</text>

            <text syncTime="3497.103" offset="14137386">First of all, I would like to make clear that the assertions of the Petitioner and the Solicitor General that our primary manufacturing requirement is an export ban simply misconstrues the facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.240" offset="14185974">If we actually banned the export of timber from the State of Alaska, we would not be able to sell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.285" offset="14214082">There simply is an inadequate market for the timber within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3520.297" offset="14230173">All interested parties understand when a sale is proposed that Alaska's timber will be exported from the state when it is sold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.144" offset="14261520">We only require that before it is exported it receive primary processing within the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.968" offset="14292867">This is no more a ban on the export of timber than were the price control programs for raisins, milk, or natural gas a ban on the export of those items on sellers who might have been willing to sell them at a lower price and export them from their states in the cases of Parker versus Brown, Milk Control Board versus Eisenberg at 306 U.S., and Cities Services Gas versus Peerless at 340 U.S.--</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.116" offset="14401432">On the foreign commerce question itself, our position is that as a market participant the state's actions are not subject to the commerce clause, whether that commerce is foreign or interstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3577.526" offset="14459111">The state's status in foreign commerce is like that of any other private trader, and therefore it is subject to the same restrictions that are imposed by the Federal Government upon any other private trader who embarks on foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.665" offset="14511669">If, nonetheless, the Court feels that the state must comply with the one-voice doctrine under the finding affairs powers of Congress, we believe that the record is more than adequate to demonstrate that we are speaking with one voice with the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.299" offset="14602157">Container Corp. makes that clear, Container Corp. which this Court decided last term, makes it clear that the inquiry with respect to one voice is whether or not the challenged action has merely a foreign resonance or does it have foreign policy implications.</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.598" offset="14667359">Neither the Petitioner nor the Solicitor General have addressed the Container Corp. standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.454" offset="14690764">We think it is clear from the record that at most what Alaska does in requiring primary manufacture before export is to create some foreign resonance, a resonance, by the way, which is totally in harmony with the same resonance which is created as a result of the federal primary manufacture requirement on timberlands would could very well be directly adjacent to state lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="3662.450" offset="14798807">Given that situation that the Federal Government has in effect created the processed timber market, that the Federal Government supplies timber in cant form in the foreign commerce market every day, we find it incredulous to believe that the Solicitor General would suggest that the State of Alaska is not speaking with the same voice that the Federal Government is speaking in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3686.876" offset="14896505">Finally, Your Honor, we wish to offer that if the Court determines that we are not a market participant, that Congress has not consented to our primary manufacture requirement, that nonetheless under the facts here the state's primary manufacture requirement satisfies traditional commerce clause analysis under the Pike versus Bruce Church case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3714.265" offset="15006010">The requirement applies evenhandedly, it applies to all purchasers regardless of their origin, be they Californian or Alaskan, be they Korean or Japanese, and it applies to interstate as well as foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="3726.404" offset="15054598">But more importantly, it effectuates an important local interest, that is of sustaining the existence of a local timber industry and sustaining the underlying economic base and social base which depends so heavily upon that timber industry in rural Alaska.</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.643" offset="15127532">This is not economic protectionism, as it is so pejoratively referred to by both the Solicitor General and the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.989" offset="15156893">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3823.788" offset="15444136">I think in that case the Court would have to look behind at their motives, and I think we're dealing with a natural resources, and that would be the same if... in fact, I believe that footnote 31 of our reply brief addresses that kind of question from a different point of view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.491" offset="15526892">What if it was something other than timber?</text>
            <text syncTime="3848.101" offset="15541416">The state has every intention, it would seem from the regulations, to require this over other natural resources.</text>
            <text syncTime="3857.338" offset="15578301">In fact, in royalty oil and gas or gas liquids, we have the same requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3863.342" offset="15602333">They've just changed the name from timber to oil and gas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3869.896" offset="15628560">Now, that would be the same kind of thing to require to sell those natural resources only to an in-state processor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3878.141" offset="15661579">And the question I have there is something from Reeves, is that when a person buys it could he then not process it at his processing plant, his timber facility if he had it, and ship it away?</text>
