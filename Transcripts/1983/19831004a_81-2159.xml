            <text syncTime="113.557" offset="605028">This is a tort action arising under state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.521" offset="628852">It was in the federal court because of diversity of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.083" offset="647138">The occasion for this tort action is that plutonium escaped from a manufacturing plant of the defendant and that plutonium contaminated Karen Silkwood and her apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.943" offset="706488">And the complaint in this action, resembling complaints that have been filed, I suppose, for time immemorial in the courts of this... of the states of this nation, sought compensatory damages for both the injury to person and to property and punitive damages for this state law tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.577" offset="797080">The jury awarded both compensatory and punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.491" offset="816724">The court of appeals, the court below, affirmed in part the compensatory damage award and reversed it in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.787" offset="857893">For all purposes here that... the rulings on the compensatory damages are not important except that the court rejected an argument of the defendant that compensatory damages were preempted by the Atomic Energy Act, and in fact held that compensatory damages could be awarded, and in fact affirmed an award of compensatory damages for property damage.</text>

            <text syncTime="233.694" offset="1085577">In the present posture of the case, the punitive damage award, if it were not preempted, the court of appeals would have to address, number one, whether that size award can properly be predicated on the property damage award; and number two, if not, whether there should be a remittitur or whether there should be a retrial on the amount of punitive damages.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="258.951" offset="1186514">Does Oklahoma law, so far as you know, as to punitive damages draw any distinction between a property damage award and a personal injury award?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="267.366" stopTime="317.518">
            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="267.366" offset="1220264">None, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.848" offset="1226115">The courts have squarely held that punitive damages may be awarded for property damage alone, or for personal injury alone, or for both.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.254" offset="1263732">The standards are identical in both cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.857" offset="1278151">And the measure of punitive damages in Oklahoma relates to the gravity of the harm threatened by the defendant's reckless or malicious conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.325" offset="1332068">So that there have been a number of Oklahoma decisions which have set aside in part a compensatory damage award and yet still affirmed in full the punitive damage award.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.523" offset="1380865">But in any event, that issue is not here.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.035" offset="1390896">That issue is the next one for the Tenth Circuit to address once it's established that punitive damages are not preempted.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="318.028" offset="1422870">Even if you won, it would be remanded then to determine whether that damages award is adequate as premised or... or excessive... excuse me... excessive as premised on only a $5,000 property--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="333.800" stopTime="729.718">
            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="333.800" offset="1485982">Well, that issue would be before the Tenth Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.441" offset="1496535">There is a question whether Kerr-McGee has waived the right to make that claim because it didn't advance it, but certainly the question of whether it has been waived or not, and if not, the question of whether the award will sustain the punitive damage award are both for the Tenth Circuit to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.044" offset="1578978">But, of course, the Tenth Circuit never got to those questions because it ruled that punitive damages are absolutely preempted by the Atomic Energy Act in any suit against a nuclear operator relating to exposure to radiation.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.009" offset="1650762">And that, of course, is the issue that has been brought to this Court by us, and there is a question at the threshold.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.284" offset="1695902">The issue was brought to this Court on an appeal alleging that the Tenth Circuit by ruling as it did had held invalid the Oklahoma punitive damage statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.113" offset="1743235">This Court has postponed the determination of jurisdiction, and I do want to spent just a moment explaining why we think that this in fact is a proper appeal under 1254.2.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.130" offset="1795271">In Oklahoma punitive damages exist only by statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.293" offset="1815960">There has been a punitive damage statute since the first territorial legislature of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="422.317" offset="1839993">There has never been a common law of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.081" offset="1859115">And that punitive damage statute makes punitive damages available, if, of course, the culpable conduct is present, in any action except a contract action.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.170" offset="1915435">And the Supreme Court of Oklahoma has read those words literally and in authoritative decisions has said that except for contract actions, punitive damages are available in any action.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.500" offset="1972800">We will not entertain arguments as to whether it's a good idea or a bad idea.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.512" offset="1992757">This is the legislative policy of this state.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.184" offset="2007490">Now, because that is the law of Oklahoma, the district court, upon finding that there was evidence to support a verdict, was required to submit the punitive damage issue to the jury and said that it was required to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.827" offset="2074050">It submitted it in the words of the statute, and the jury found a violation in reliance on that charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.220" offset="2103621">Both parties told the court of appeals that punitive damages in Oklahoma are governed exclusively by this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.327" offset="2136117">And the court below, given those arguments and given an argument by Kerr-McGee that there was preemption, began its conclusive paragraph, the paragraph where it found preemption, saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="512.426" offset="2200483">"Arguably, there should be a strong presumption against preemption of state laws affecting such vital interests of its citizens as those involved here. "</text>
            <text syncTime="526.027" offset="2254818">Now, in Oklahoma the only state law that the court could have been referring to was 23 Oklahoma Statute Section 9.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.153" offset="2299330">And though the court did not cite that section by name, having begun that conclusive paragraph saying</text>
            <text syncTime="544.176" offset="2327438">"Arguably, there are strong arguments against preemption of state laws, but nevertheless, we find preemption. "</text>
            <text syncTime="551.503" offset="2356800">we submit that the court has held invalid Section 9 as applied to nuclear operators in radiation cases in the full substance and import of its opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.761" offset="2405805">We think, indeed, that's what it said, but whether it said it or not, that is certainly the effect of what it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.697" offset="2441541">And as the Solicitor General acknowledges, appellate jurisdiction exists if the invalidity of the state statute was a necessary predicate for the court of appeals decision, and we think it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.763" offset="2493786">Now, turning to the issue on the merits, the preemption issue, we're dealing here with a state's right to punish, to punish conduct that injures people and that injures people and is accompanied by a particularly reprehensible state of mind... either the deliberate infliction of injury or the infliction of injury with a reckless disregard for the safety of the state's citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.328" offset="2640071">Now, this kind of punishment, this civil punishment, if you will, punitive damages, has been a traditional element of the tort law in 46 states of this country and is still in the tort law of 46 states.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.398" offset="2708303">And what it is designed to do lies at the core of the state's interest, that the police power is designed to protect people against reprehensible conduct, very much as the criminal law is.</text>
            <text syncTime="653.857" offset="2766191">And the question we have here is whether Congress in enacting the Atomic Energy Act intended to deprive the states of this traditional piece of a tort action.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.097" offset="2819167">This is not a separate action.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.017" offset="2826795">It is a remedy available in the traditional tort action.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.480" offset="2840692">And, of course, the answer is wholly one of congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.532" offset="2860858">We approach that question with certain assumptions that this Court has stated are always the starting point for analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.460" offset="2896594">First, an attempt to preempt a traditional state right is never lightly presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.323" offset="2924075">That is especially so when the state right is exercised in the form of tort actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.269" offset="2951869">This court has said that.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.530" offset="2960855">And it is, we would suggest, uniquely so in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.503" offset="2980813">Never in the jurisprudence of this nation, not in this Court, not in any other court, has there ever before been a holding that Congress left compensatory damages unpreemptive and yet preempted the punitive damages in that very same cause of action.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="729.718" stopTime="746.138">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="729.718" offset="3069629">--Yet, Mr. Gottesman, the position you take that punitive damages are primarily to punish suggests, at least in your view, that the punitive damages serve a much different purpose than compensatory damages, which I suppose are just to make whole.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="746.138" stopTime="775.577">
            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="746.138" offset="3135353">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.119" offset="3139219">They serve a different purpose, but the reason that you don't find that kind of selective preemption is that the purpose that they serve, punitive damages, lie absolutely at the core of the state's interest and much more at the periphery of the federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="763.639" offset="3205361">So that as I'll indicate, as we do in our brief... and if we have time, I'll get to... it would be much less likely that Congress would make a judgment to preempt punitive damages than compensatory.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="775.577" offset="3253113">Are you suggesting it would be more likely if they had to choose that they would have preempted compensatory damages?</text>

          <turn speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="780.341" stopTime="804.575">
            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="780.341" offset="3272130">Well, I think it's not likely they would choose to select between them, and indeed, there's never been a ruling by this Court that found one and not the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.188" offset="3307552">Congress either leaves tort actions alone or it doesn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="793.079" offset="3323121">And indeed, the burden of what I'm about to come to is that Congress has made rather remarkably clear here an intention to leave state tort actions alone, one that encompasses.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="804.575" stopTime="824.010">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="804.575" offset="3369097">Of course, logically, though, punitive damages are in a sense regulatory, and it was Congress' intent to leave in place... to leave the regulatory aspects to the NRC for safety purposes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_h_gottesman" startTime="824.010" stopTime="903.962">
            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="824.010" offset="3446837">Well, I think logically, Justice O'Connor, both compensatory and punitive damages are regulatory, and this Court has repeatedly so said.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.716" offset="3489573">Both have regulatory effects.</text>
            <text syncTime="837.226" offset="3499709">Both have regulatory purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.520" offset="3508800">For example, the state court, by determining what is the standard of care that it will hold Kerr-McGee to and hold it responsible, therefore, for compensatory damages, regulates.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.069" offset="3567000">If it says the standard of care is simple, reasonable care, it imposes one burden on Kerr-McGee.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.113" offset="3595213">If it says the standard is absolute, strict liability, it holds Kerr-McGee to a much stricter standard of performance.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.459" offset="3624574">So that both compensatory and punitive damages are regulatory; they regulate different things.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.195" offset="3655503">Compensatory damages regulate what the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulates: the standard of care with which you operate your plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.322" offset="3692075">Punitive damages regulate something that the NRC does not regulate: your state of mind in the operation of that plant, whether you are the kind of person who behaves with a reprehensible state of mind.</text>

            <text syncTime="903.962" offset="3766576">Mr. Gottesman, are you conceding, in effect, that the radioisotopes involved here are subject to the same preemption doctrine as perhaps the operation of a nuclear reactor would have been?</text>

            <text syncTime="924.058" offset="3847033">I think the answer would be the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.789" offset="3857900">But I think it's important to note that this plant was not covered by the Price-Anderson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.723" offset="3881619">As to this plant Congress made the judgment we have no interest in impeding the operation of state tort law at all, as contrasted with a nuclear power plant where Congress has made certain selective judgments to override the state tort law.</text>

            <label>Mr. Michael H. Gottesman</label>
            <text syncTime="963.414" offset="4004395">--Oh, absolutely not.</text>
            <text syncTime="965.244" offset="4011709">I would assume that, assuming states can otherwise prosecute terrorists criminally for invading any other plant, they could likewise prosecute them for invading a nuclear power plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.514" offset="4056849">I shouldn't think that there would be a question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.216" offset="4075657">Indeed, I think even the Solicitor General's brief concedes you can prosecute everybody but the corporation itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.930" offset="4102511">Now, however we might derive answers to this logically, the fact is that the determinative question here is what Congress intended and what logic Congress was applying.</text>
            <text syncTime="1003.030" offset="4162906">And we have the benefit here of a much more extensive insight into Congress' views about preemption than we ordinarily have in a preemption case, because Congress spoke a lot more about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.141" offset="4223301">To be sure, as this Court held last term in Pacific Gas and Electric, Congress in enacting the 1954 Atomic Energy Act and opening up this industry to the private sector reserved to federal exclusive control regulation, at least in the strictest sense: licensing, inspections, that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.289" offset="4331866">There's no question that Congress occupied that field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1049.160" offset="4347435">And, indeed, those on the other side of this case embrace the statement that this Court made in PG&amp;E that Congress has occupied the field of regulation, and seek to evolve their entire solution out of that sentence of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.153" offset="4415353">But it can't be done, because were that proposition right, it would follow that Congress had preempted compensatory damage remedies as well, which this Court has repeatedly said are regulatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.522" offset="4472822">And yet, everybody understands, and this Court has said in Duke Power and PG&amp;E, that when Congress enacted the 1954 Act, it did not preempt the state's existing rights to entertain tort actions by those who were the victims of radiation injuries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.467" offset="4564669">And, indeed, it's precisely because the '54 Act did not preempt those tort actions that we got the Price-Anderson Act, because people said we're not going to enter this field; we are afraid of our potential tort liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.158" offset="4631438">And so Congress addressed that question of tort liability in the Price-Anderson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.332" offset="4660068">Now, Congress in that act did not cede to the states the right to entertain tort actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.658" offset="4689430">That's what our adversaries here say.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.489" offset="4696744">They say Congress ceded to the states the right to have tort actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.282" offset="4711895">That's not what Price-Anderson did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.773" offset="4721822">Congress said the states have these tort actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.266" offset="4735823">They have them already.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.956" offset="4742615">The question here is whether we should put any limitations on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1151.489" offset="4756721">And in that context Congress spoke at length about its view about the state tort action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.772" offset="4785874">We have a window to congressional understanding here that is quite unique, and I want to refer just to a few of the statements, and to read them very briefly, that Congress made expressing its views.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.174" offset="4851493">The other side says well, never mind what Congress said here: they really only meant compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.149" offset="4883363">But that wasn't the congressional mind-set.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.541" offset="4896947">For example, the Joint Committee report in 1956... and this is when the only interference with state tort law that Congress made was to put a $560 million limit of liability for certain operators, not for Kerr-McGee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.932" offset="4966537">The Joint Committee report stated the two basic principles underlying the bill, and the first of those was,</text>
            <text syncTime="1210.938" offset="4994540">"Since the rights of third parties who are injured are established by state law, there is no interference with the state law except for the $560 million limit of liability. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1228.029" offset="5062876">Senator Pastore, who was the chairman of the Joint Committee when the '66... or the floor manager, I'm sorry... when the '66 amendments were made said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.346" offset="5100179">"This bill follows the approach of the original Price-Anderson Act; that is, making a minimum interference with the laws of the several states insofar as legal liability for nuclear incidents is concerned. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.407" offset="5164336">"Our committee continues to endorse this general approach. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.219" offset="5183667">Finally, the Joint Committee in 1966:</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.652" offset="5197355">"The bill has been drafted so that minor claims involving nuclear facilities or materials. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.785" offset="5225880">--and what we have here is a minor claim...</text>
            <text syncTime="1270.978" offset="5234658">"may remain subject to the traditional rules of tort law. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.032" offset="5258899">Now, there are no qualifications, and this isn't a semantic thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.763" offset="5273841">Congress had a mind-set, and it approached this problem with several concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="1288.509" offset="5304770">The first of those concerns was that Congress or the sponsors of Price-Anderson felt that if they tried to overly interfere with state tort, well, they couldn't get a bill through Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.958" offset="5354612">And so there are a number of statements quoted in our brief of the principal sponsors of this legislation saying we are going to proceed by selective limitation on the state tort law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.335" offset="5400065">We will identify with precision what it is about state tort law that we think we need to modify, because that's the only way we're going to get a bill through Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.352" offset="5444160">If we try to reach out in an overly broad way in a field that is so sensitively one of state's rights, we're not going to get this bill through.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.100" offset="5487209">So that was number one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.590" offset="5493165">Number two, they thought this to be an area that was big and mysterious and had lots of elements, and it was different in every state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.826" offset="5534021">And they said there's... the chairman of the Joint Committee said there's a jungle of 50 states' tort laws out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.771" offset="5561815">We don't know where to begin to tackle those, and we don't want to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.034" offset="5578847">We are simply going to identify what the problems are that we think we need to address and address them explicitly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.929" offset="5610507">And finally and most importantly, Congress said that except for extraordinary nuclear occurrences... the meltdown of a power plant... there is no reason why a nuclear plant should be treated any differently than any other business entity in this country in terms of its amenability to the tort law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1419.476" offset="5828682">But if we're dealing with radiation emissions, then however the state may put the label, if my property or my person is injured by the emission of radiation and I suffer an injury, I have one of these lawsuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.504" offset="5888764">So that I think the answer would be yes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.429" offset="6164512">Now... now, I do want to note we have in our brief noted that there... it is unmistakable that the Atomic Energy Commission in 1966 after this bill believed... and it was the agency administering the statute... believed that punitive damages were available.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.032" offset="6230863">In the limited time I have remaining I don't want to focus on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.374" offset="6244238">But the point that I do want to focus on and close with is that Congress made a judgment repeatedly articulated in this legislative history that except where we're dealing with an ENO, there is no reason why these plants should be treated under the tort law any differently than any other plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.916" offset="6322396">And Kerr-McGee is here saying ah, but because we're a nuclear operator, we ought to be exempted from the rules that are applicable in tort suits against every other plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.214" offset="6379657">Whatever the logic that they could spin out for that, that is not the decision that Congress made, and the legislative evidence is overwhelming that Congress made the opposite decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="1670.349" offset="6832202">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.401" offset="6844323">As has been noted, this case comes to the Court as a $5,000 property damage case, the personal injury aspects of the case having been disposed of by the court of appeals below and not the subject of appeal here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.590" offset="6901165">The liability for that $5,000 in property damages resulted from a... on the basis of a liability without fault under the doctrine of strict liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1699.147" offset="6947350">The plaintiff conceded that he did not and could not prove how the contamination to Karen Silkwood's property occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.546" offset="6988937">Now, the question, the principal question raised by this case is whether an award of punitive damages with respect to a claim based on radiation hazards resulting from the operation of a federally licensed and regulated plutonium plant is preempted by the Atomic Energy Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.567" offset="7065005">As has been noted, the question of jurisdiction has been reserved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.911" offset="7078380">Just a brief comment on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.432" offset="7084440">The plaintiff seeks to make jurisdiction in this Court for mandatory appeal under Section 1254.2 of the Judicial Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="1743.019" offset="7122788">That section is to be strictly and narrowly construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.623" offset="7141283">It permits mandatory appeal only when the court of appeals invalidates a state statute as being repugnant to the Constitution or the laws of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.696" offset="7177541">In this case, the state statute which the plaintiff seeks to invoke was not even mentioned by the court of appeals, much less held invalid either facially or as applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.857" offset="7226233">All the court did here was hold punitive damages under the circumstances of this case cannot be awarded; and thus we urge that there is no jurisdiction in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.839" offset="7274089">Also, we suggest to you that this is not an appropriate case to take on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.583" offset="7293107">Its unique facts make it very unlikely that it will have any precedential value, and the basic principle upon which it relies... namely, that stated in Pacific Gas and Electric... does not involve any conflict in the circuits but is now well settled in light of your decision last term.</text>
            <text syncTime="1803.425" offset="7364473">Now, turning to the merits, in your decision in Pacific Gas and Electric you described two forms of preemption, both of which are applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.733" offset="7413688">First, you said there is preemption if the Congress has fully occupied a field.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.778" offset="7437825">You also said there is preemption even if Congress does not fully occupy a field if the state action stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment of the federal purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.845" offset="7482129">Both those preemptions exist in this case and require affirmance of the decision below.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.770" offset="7509818">Let's talk about the first one first.</text>

            <text syncTime="1910.696" offset="7793508">The fact of the matter is that the suggestion here, the argument here that there is... that compensatory damages are also preempted and that somehow the Court was inconsistent in holding that punitive damages were preempted and compensatories were not I believe is wrong for at least two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.230" offset="7883683">First of all, Congress in the Price-Anderson Act and in the legislative history related to the Price-Anderson Act indicated an intention that with respect to the compensation of injured victims, making them whole, it was the intention of Congress that they should have available state tort law remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1953.574" offset="7965080">No such intention with respect to punitive damage was ever expressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.365" offset="7984202">Secondly, and probably more important, the argument of the plaintiff here ignores the distinction between punitive damages and compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.373" offset="8028297">Punitive damages have as their sole function controlling of conduct, conduct that the jury believes does not meet the safety standard that should be applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.781" offset="8073854">Compensatory damages, on the other hand, have as their primary function the recompensing of the injured plaintiff; in other words, making the plaintiff whole.</text>

            <text syncTime="2031.085" offset="8275102">I believe, particularly in Oklahoma, the law is that punitive damages are to punish and deter conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.282" offset="8319928">As a matter of fact, this Court reaffirmed that principle just last term in Smith v. Wade where it said the purposes of punitive damage is to punish reprehensible conduct and deter the defendant and others from engaging in that conduct in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.320" offset="8384084">In fact, under Oklahoma law if punitive damages do not have the effect of punishing and deterring conduct, they will not be permitted to stand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.339" offset="8428075">The case cited in our brief, the Nixon case, stands for that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.701" offset="8445524">And in the most recent brief filed last week by the plaintiff, its reply brief, there's cited a new Oklahoma punitive damage case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2083.618" offset="8485231">It's the most recent statement by the Oklahoma Supreme Court on the subject of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.762" offset="8509786">That case not only restates all the principles that we expressed in our brief concerning the role of punitive damages, but it has this additional statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.147" offset="8543327">It said,</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.449" offset="8548551">"Unlike the purpose of compensatory damages, which are to benefit the individual plaintiff, punitive damages are imposed to benefit society. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.965" offset="8590661">"The plaintiff acts as a private attorney general to punish the culpable wrongdoer, thereby encouraging adherence to safety standards that benefit consumers generally. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.826" offset="8650115">So what the court in the Theory v. Armstrong case at 661 Pacific Second and cited in the second footnote to the plaintiff's reply brief, has made it clear is that punitive damages in Oklahoma are for the purpose of imposing a safety standard and then enforcing it.</text>

            <text syncTime="2976.014" offset="12054811">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.046" offset="12082919">I would like to make just two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.258" offset="12095771">The first of them is that the federal regulations in this case do exactly what the state of Oklahoma was trying to do through the imposition of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.176" offset="12143418">And the second point is that there is indeed a difference between compensatory and punitive damages which demonstrates that Congress intended to prohibit punitive damages and intended to encourage compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.108" offset="12207157">Let me just say a few words about my first point, which is that federal regulation is not only adequate to cover this case but also does exactly what Oklahoma did.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.749" offset="12277792">The Atomic Energy Act in Section 2077A and the regulations promulgated by the NRC in Section 70.3 say that you can't possess plutonium without a license.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.060" offset="12339023">They also say that you can't transfer plutonium except to a licensee.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.682" offset="12357518">There is no limit on the amount of plutonium that they're speaking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.215" offset="12379670">That means that with respect to the 300 micrograms that were found in Silkwood's apartment in this case that if either party had been responsible for the transfer or the possession of that plutonium in the apartment, it would have... it would have violated both the statute and the regulations.</text>

            <label>Mr. John H. Garvey</label>
            <text syncTime="3135.528" offset="12692826">Well, I think if you look at the AEC analysis of the bill, which appears in 105 Congressional Record '83-'84, and if you read the House and Senate reports that accompany the 1959 amendments, it's clear that Congress made a distinction between facilities that possess special nuclear material in quantities sufficient to form a critical mass, and this was such a facility, on the one hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.883" offset="12802331">And radioisotopes that are used for medical purposes or related uses, on the other hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="3171.959" offset="12838589">There is no doubt but that Congress intended to cover this facility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.631" offset="12849247">There is no doubt but that the... that the amount of plutonium found in her apartment, had Kerr-McGee been responsible for its presence there, would have violated both the statute and the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.981" offset="12894700">I might go on to say that the regulations also provide in great detail for the... for the protection of workers in plutonium and processing facilities like this one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.209" offset="12951647">They talk about what sort of precautionary procedures have to be taken in handling plutonium.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.431" offset="12968470">They also set exposure limitations which... which... which apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.119" offset="13011206">The baseline exposure limitation is that operators of these kinds of facilities have to keep exposures as low as reasonably achievable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3224.834" offset="13050076">Now, any willful exposure to plutonium almost by definition violates the as low as reasonably achievable standard, but it might also say that the amount of plutonium that the NRC discovered on its investigation in this case... that was discovered at the autopsy, had it been received in the course of a week or even in the course of a quarter would also have violated the numerical limitations that are found at the end of Part 20 of 10 CFR.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.944" offset="13166582">In addition to that statutory and regulatory scheme, the NRC imposes on licensees specifically tailored license conditions to make sure that these plants are operated safely.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.653" offset="13221335">In this case the license was about that thick.</text>

            <text syncTime="3291.889" offset="13318302">The NRC concluded that the appellees had not violated the federal regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="3350.747" offset="13553717">On the other hand, Congress enacted Section 2282 for the specific purpose of allowing the NRC itself to impose civil fines.</text>

            <text syncTime="3482.504" offset="14080764">That's, I might add, a sensible reason for drawing a line between compensatory and punitive damages in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.191" offset="14119529">In Pacific Gas and Electric this Court said that states were free to reject nuclear power if it cost too much, but not because it was unsafe.</text>

            <text syncTime="3869.066" offset="15627004">The deterrent purpose is that so people won't violate the regulations again.</text>

            <text syncTime="3893.242" offset="15723761">In this case it happens that the outrage was perpetrated with plutonium, but the deterrent purpose of the state extends to everything that Kerr-McGee does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3903.370" offset="15764199">Kerr-McGee doesn't just handle plutonium.</text>

            <text syncTime="3910.363" offset="15792202">The state's concern is that it has found a defendant that proceeds with a reckless disregard for the safety of its citizens, and the function of punitive damages is to make that defendant stop doing what it does with reckless disregard.</text>
