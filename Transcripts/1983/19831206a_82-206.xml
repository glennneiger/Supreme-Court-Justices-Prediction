            <text syncTime="14.532" offset="207071">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.802" offset="220133">In this case the Court is confronted with a situation where Respondents settled an employment discrimination case for specified relief, waiving any further relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.830" offset="264227">Later, because Respondents had not foreseen the possibility of events which they should have foreseen, they discovered they wanted additional relief under circumstances which make the granting of such relief inequitable and illegal.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.919" offset="320547">The granting of that relief is the subject of the appeal before the Court at this time.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.963" offset="344789">This matter arises out of the following background.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.366" offset="358373">The case was settled in 1980 with the entry of a consent decree which provided hiring and promotional relief consistent with the complaints which were filed in the cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.482" offset="402885">The city agreed to a long term goal of raising the percentage of blacks on the fire department in each rank to the percentage of blacks in the work force as a whole.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="74.549" offset="447084">I take it this was a Title 7 case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allen S. Blair</label>
            <text syncTime="76.482" offset="454817">It was, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.872" offset="460459">The complaint was also filed under Section 1981 and Section 1983 of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.897" offset="488462">The decree also contained what were interim goals for hiring and promotions.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.842" offset="528273">No relief was granted with regard to the city's layoff policies or the city's seniority policies, and there was no constructive competitive seniority awarded in the decree, again consistent with the complaints, and the Respodents waived any further relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.353" offset="598386">In May of 1981, the City of Memphis, facing a fiscal crisis, announced that there would be layoffs in every city department, including the fire department, and those layoffs were to be conducted consistent with the city's longstanding, city-wide seniority policy which was adopted with regard to layoffs in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.520" offset="695039">The Respondents sought injunctive relief in the Federal District Court against the application of the senior policy insofar as it would reduce the percentage of blacks on the fire department.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.859" offset="752404">The District Court, after ruling that the issue before the court was not whether the city could lay off, but the manner in which the city would lay off, issued the requested injunctive relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.539" offset="811127">The court directed the city to come up with a plan consistent with the court's ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.532" offset="835055">That court's order caused three innocent, incumbent, white firefighters to be laid off who would not have been laid off had the seniority policy been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.182" offset="889703">It also caused seven additional senior, innocent, incumbent, white drivers to be demoted or laid off from their position or, in the parlance of the shop, bumped down.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.102" offset="949367">It also caused five additional senior innocent, incumbent, white inspectors to be bumped down and nine additional senior, innocent, incumbent, white lieutenants to be bumped down.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.853" offset="1008299">The Court of Appeals affirmed in an opinion which addressed several matters really not at issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.196" offset="1037661">While the Respodents and the Court of Appeals attempt to uphold the District Court's ruling as both an interpretation and a modification of the consent decree, we respectfully submit that it is clear the consent decree did not provide the relief requested and that the circumstances necessary to allow for the modification of a consent decree are absent herein.</text>

            <text syncTime="258.841" offset="1184260">--Justice Rehnquist, in terms of the ultimate result, I don't think it makes any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="265.485" offset="1210905">It is our position that it was not an interpretation, that the relief was not provided in the decree at all, and that if the Court then wants to take the next step and analyze whether modification would have been proper under these circumstances, then we respectfully submit that modification was not proper because the proper circumstances were not present in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="829.164" offset="3465586">We have a rather odd situation where industrial and commercial property in Tennessee is actually taxed at a higher rate than residential property which naturally has the effect of discouraging business and industry to move into our area.</text>

            <text syncTime="886.802" offset="3696090">Justice Marshall, I can't really speak authoritatively to that except that I would say this, that I don't imagine that there are a great many cities which are in the position of Memphis in that they have reached the maximum sales tax that they can impose.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.319" offset="3750216">Other than that and the income tax, I would say no, but I would respectfully submit to Your Honor that those are significant differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.326" offset="3782190">You are talking about two of what are the three major sources normally that a municipality has for income.</text>
            <text syncTime="915.320" offset="3810193">To continue to address your question, Justice Powell, it also seems to me that this is one of those cases that evades review.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.107" offset="3841331">As this Court has previously recognized, as noted in our reply brief, layoffs are, by their nature, temporary.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.581" offset="3871215">Now, that is not a hard and fast rule, but this Court has recognized that in its prior decisions, and we would submit that this case clearly falls within the doctrine of capable of repetition, yet evading review.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.640" offset="3923460">With regard to the interpretation argument, may it please the Court, any claim of the Respondents that is based on an interpretation or effectuation of the consent decree must be settled with reference to the terms of that consent decree, and the terms here are completely unavailing to the Respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.464" offset="4022830">What we really have here is a situation where they sought new relief barred by the waiver to bail them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.200" offset="4057729">In fact, the situation was clearly foreseeable.</text>
            <text syncTime="982.536" offset="4079045">We have a situation where the city adopted a seniority-based layoff policy in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.118" offset="4105377">It was negotiated into the union's contract in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.300" offset="4118124">Therefore, the union and the city foresaw the serious possibility of layoffs in 1975 and codified that concern, if you will, in a public document.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.428" offset="4158666">Other cities were experiencing a great many financial difficulties at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.492" offset="4182908">In our own circuit, the city of Cincinnati had to lay off in their fire department and confronted a dispute very much like this one which went to the Sixth Circuit, which resulted in an opinion by the Sixth Circuit in 1978, of which the Respondents should have been aware.</text>
            <text syncTime="1022.961" offset="4240795">And we would submit that any plaintiff in a Title 7 case must analyze the relief that he or she is getting in a consent decree by way of those landmark events in the employment relationship, hiring, promotion, demotion, layoff and recall, termination, and retirement, and look at the relief that they are going to get in the consent decree and say is this all that I am entitled to, is this all that I need?</text>

            <text syncTime="1117.643" offset="4619466">But given the fact that the court went further, if it was proper for the court to go further, then clearly, the court couldn't say that we waived, that is, the city and the union, waived our right to insist that victim status be proved and established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.432" offset="4674637">I hope I have answered your question.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1150.344" offset="4750288">Mr. Solicitor General?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="1154.015" stopTime="1439.113">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="1154.015" offset="4765021">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.057" offset="4777142">The issue in this case is squarely controlled by this Court's holding in Teamsters v. United States that federal courts lack the power to grant constructive, competitive seniority to nonvictims of employment discrimination, that is, those who have not shown that they individually are persons against whom discrimination was practiced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.734" offset="4867839">In Teamsters, the District Court found that the employer had engaged in a pattern and practice of discrimination against blacks and Spanish-surnamed Americans, and in order to remedy this discrimination, the Court of Appeals awarded constructive, retroactive seniority to each member of the class.</text>
            <text syncTime="1198.134" offset="4941504">The previous term, in Franks v. Bowman Transportation Company, the Court had held that proven individual victims were entitled to be slotted into their rightful place in the seniority system, that is, the place that they would have enjoyed but for the discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.218" offset="5009840">Under Franks, therefore, both the discriminatees and also their innocent coworkers whose rights are necessarily affected by the grant of constructive competitive seniority, are relegated to the respective positions that they would have enjoyed if the discrimination had never occurred, but for persons not proven to be victims, the Court held in Teamsters that such an award of constructive seniority is outside the remedial authority of a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.207" offset="5137736">The defect in this court's order, the order of the district court in this case, is that what the court did here is precisely what this court held in Teamsters that a federal court cannot do, namely, grant constructive competitive seniority to persons who have not proven that they are actual victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.298" offset="5214118">And the only difference is in the timing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.111" offset="5221328">Under Teamsters, the district court could not have given enhanced competitive seniority at the time of its original decree against the possibility of layoffs to nonvictims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.759" offset="5267930">Certainly it has no power, no greater power once they occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="1284.271" offset="5286007">This Court has observed frequently, and I am quoting now from Hardison, that seniority systems are afforded special treatment under Title 7, and indeed, it is quite apparent from the legislative history of Title 7 that the Dirksen-Mansfield compromise which brought 703(h) into existence was key to the enactment of Title 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.397" offset="5366464">Given the importance of seniority systems to Title 7, it would make no sense at all, we submit, to ignore seniority in the single context where it really matters, particularly when you consider that beginning with Franks in 1976, this Court has been called upon with some frequency and in various contexts to reach an accommodation between the achievement on the one hand of the twin objectives of Title 7, which is to eliminate discrimination and compensate its victims, and on the other hand, the protection of bona fide seniority systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.285" offset="5498017">There are about a half a dozen such cases that deal with that accommodation, and the opinions are characterized by two persistent themes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.603" offset="5539290">The first of those themes focuses on who are the beneficiaries of Title 7 remedial orders, and draws a bright line distinction between victims and nonvictims, and that's Franks and Teamsters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1360.891" offset="5592475">The second theme concerns the other half of the remedial calculus which is who pays the bill, and more specifically, to what extent are the costs for eradicating employment discrimination and compensating its victims, to be borne by those who did the discriminating, namely, the employers, through back pay, front pay, enhanced benefits seniority, if you will, and to what extent by innocent victims... or excuse me, third-party innocent coworkers, other employees who have done no wrong but whose rights will necessarily be affected if the remedy includes an award of competitive seniority because as this court observed about a year and a half ago in Fort Motor, a competitive seniority award costs the employer nothing and sends the bill to fellow workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.638" offset="5811486">Out of these cases, the law which has emerged is clear, and it is that there is only one circumstance under which federal courts are empowered as part of their remedy for employment discrimination, to award competitive seniority rights, and that is where the beneficiaries of those competitive rights are actual victims.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.632" offset="5903437">That--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1439.113" offset="5905422">Mr. Lee, can the employer entering into a consent decree waive that requirement, in your view?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="1448.259" stopTime="1525.119">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="1448.259" offset="5941994">--I suppose that an employer could, as a matter of agreement, at the front end of the decree, could agree to it, and thereby would waive it, but Teamsters is rather careful in spelling out the procedure that is to be followed, and it is a two-step procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.104" offset="6025377">The first step is the process of proving pattern and practice, and the second step is the practice of proving, or is the process of proving who is a victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="1478.319" offset="6062157">From one perspective, Franks itself, which does grant competitive seniority to actual victims, imposes part of the cost on innocent coworkers, but at least under Franks, the cost distribution among the victims and the innocent coworkers is the same distribution that would have occurred if there had been no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1504.065" offset="6165184">It simply puts the relative parties back in the same position that they would have enjoyed in the absence of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.729" offset="6187858">To go beyond that and to require that coworkers bear the burdens that they would not have borne even if their employer had never discriminated is to go beyond the limits of federal judicial power, and that's what Teamsters holds.</text>

            <text syncTime="1650.350" offset="6750327">Of course not, and that is exactly the point that I hope that I was making.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.462" offset="6762761">The assertion by the Respondents and several amici that Title 7 seniority guarantees, 703(h), is substantive and not remedial simply cannot survive this court's decisions in Teamsters and Ford Motor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.190" offset="6809677">The issue in Ford Motor, for example, was not whether the provisions of the seniority system substantively amounted to employment discrimination, but rather, whether the proposed remedies permissible, in the language of this court's closing sentence, threaten the interests of other innocent employees by disrupting the established seniority hierarchy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.883" offset="6892433">Teamsters and Ford Motor amply demonstrate the obvious, that in crafting equitable remedies under Title 7, Federal Courts are not free to ignore the effect that those remedies will have on substantive Title 7 policies, and the protection of seniority systems is certainly one of those policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.077" offset="6969233">Finally, it has also been suggested that notwithstanding the defects... I mean, Teamsters is simply unavoidable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1712.071" offset="6997236">Teamsters does control this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.622" offset="7003401">Teamsters is a Title 7 decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.502" offset="7010924">But the Respondents and their amici nevertheless suggest that Title 7 is not the only source of judicial authority to enter this decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.587" offset="7043316">That argument will notwithstand analysis because under any circumstance it was an equitable decree, and basic principles of equity teach that federal courts applying equitable principles are to shape those decrees in accord with the substantive policies to be achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.520" offset="7114996">This is, above all, an employment discrimination decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.294" offset="7134118">The federal policy dealing with employment discrimination is contained in Title 7, and under those circumstances, under any argument, the content of an employment discrimination decree must be shaped by the substantive policies of Title 7, including the protection of seniority systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.418" offset="7226591">Unless the Court has further questions, I have nothing else.</text>

            <text syncTime="2733.320" offset="11082160">--Yes, but in that, of course, we don't know how long the layoffs would have happened because in the Boston case the state legislature passed a statute mandating that the workers be put back to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.520" offset="11126986">That's what intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2746.280" offset="11134092">Layoffs themselves, though, are not inherently short of duration, and there are facts in other instances to show that--</text>
            <text syncTime="2756.166" offset="11173589">Also, in terms of the interest rate argument, in the reply brief, this is the first time we had seen it, I don't know the city could predict interest rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2767.314" offset="11218206">In our national economy we have the Secretary of Treasury saying the interest rates are going down, the Council of Economic Advisors Chairman saying they are going up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2776.450" offset="11254673">It is our position that really this Court shouldn't decide that issue if major people in the administration can't even decide it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.587" offset="11291244">In terms of what Judge McRea did, and in terms of the consent decree, this consent decree does have a specific purpose as stated in paragraph 17.</text>
            <text syncTime="2806.748" offset="11375881">The purpose is to remedy the past hiring and promotional practices of the City of Memphis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2812.693" offset="11399705">It also includes specific promotional goals and hiring goals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.486" offset="11414856">What the city proposed to do in this case was to in fact demote and lay off people that were hired specifically and promoted specifically because of that decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.786" offset="11472116">In Exhibit A to the decree there are listed specific promotions that were to be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.148" offset="11497507">One of those promotions was to the particular named plaintiff, Mr. Fred Jones.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.591" offset="11519241">He was scheduled to be demoted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.194" offset="11525719">There is nothing in the consent decree that puts any condition upon these promotions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.267" offset="11545991">Judge McRea also looked at the other circumstances surrounding it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.301" offset="11570128">In paragraph 6, again it states the purpose, that the purpose was to remedy the past hiring and promotional practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2868.431" offset="11622686">This preliminary injunction issued by Judge McRea is to be judged on a standard of abuses of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2874.842" offset="11648286">In this case, Judge McRea did not abuse his discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2879.747" offset="11667930">Many of the blacks who were scheduled to be laid off were hired or promoted as a result of the 1980 decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2886.312" offset="11694157">The consent decree at no point authorizes the fire department to reduce black representation until the long term goal has been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.088" offset="11729266">It is a continuing remedial obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.389" offset="11742431">It is the words of the consent decree and not Title 7 that governs what Judge McRea's authority was to provide this preliminary relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.499" offset="11806902">The limited relief actually afforded by the preliminary injunction therefore did not constitute abuse of discretion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.043" offset="11837099">The... his order of May 18 simply required that specific proportions of blacks be maintained in certain job classifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.830" offset="11876283">Judge McRea not only reviewed these job classifications, he reviewed all of the proposed layoffs that were to be made at least proposed by the fire department.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.129" offset="11917452">On May 18, no one knew how many people were going to be laid off.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.030" offset="11933021">No one knew which job classifications were necessarily going to be affected.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.034" offset="11957053">It was all proposed by the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.354" offset="11966353">What Judge McRea did was propose a standard by which the city could come up with a layoff policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2960.899" offset="11992475">At the later point when they submitted their plan, the city chose to make the layoffs in such a way that it would affect employees as they stated no a seniority basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="2975.389" offset="12050467">There were other alternatives, but that was not gotten into by Judge McRea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.514" offset="12070947">He simply told the city that they had to continue to fulfill their remedial obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.148" offset="12093517">By issuing this narrowly drawn preliminary injunction prohibiting the city from implementing the proposed layoff policy as it would affect the relief already achieved under the consent decree, Judge McRea did not modify existing provisions of the decree; he did not confer new rights nor impose new obligations on the parties, or take away any contractual or seniority rights allegedly enjoyed by nonparties.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.969" offset="12224756">Rather, Judge McRea merely prevented the city from abrogating the degree in which it obligated itself to raise the percentage of black employees in each job classification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3031.796" offset="12276061">Judge McRea consciously did not tell the city how to lay off employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.240" offset="12301870">He consciously did not involve himself in the internal operations of city employment practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="3044.945" offset="12328724">He left it up to the city to select a means of meeting its financial obligations without interfering with this remedial obligation in the decree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.204" offset="12377729">I would just like to make one other point about the United States position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.728" offset="12395806">If the United States is upheld, position is upheld, then of course this would, we believe, and I think the EEOC believes in a footnote to the Justice Department's brief, abrogate any consent decree or any case ever being settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.548" offset="12463097">It would require full litigation of every employment discrimination case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3366.146" offset="13613530">Until the layoffs which were the first in the history of Memphis occurred, this issue was never presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.471" offset="13638817">And that is another point that the petitioners present that we should have anticipated this layoff.</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.807" offset="13668178">This layoff was not anticipated by anyone, and in fact, as I stated, in the history of Memphis there had never been a layoff.</text>

            <text syncTime="3387.390" offset="13698480">Well, if this case were reversed, what would the real effect be on parties who are contemplating a consent decree?</text>
            <text syncTime="3396.145" offset="13733484">Would it be likely to encourage them to at least address these issues in the consent decree and not have a decree like this one that didn't address layoffs?</text>

            <text syncTime="3408.354" offset="13782386">If it were affirmed or reversed, that would be the happenstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.837" offset="13804224">I think after the Boston firefighters case, no one would enter a consent decree without addressing those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3419.431" offset="13826689">But until layoffs occurred, particularly in the city of Memphis, this was not an issue in this case or in any of... in the Justice Department's consent decree of 1974 which, I might add, if the Justice Department's position today is upheld, that would abrogate its consent decree that it entered into with the city in 1974 because its decree provides for hiring and promotional goals with the City of Memphis in all departments.</text>

            <text syncTime="3447.060" offset="13937135">Well, if the practical effect is that the parties would be likely in the future to certainly consider and address in the decree of layoffs, then you get back to the question of the extent to which the city and the union, for example, can affect in the terms of the decree the rights of any innocent employees for layoff purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="3475.457" offset="14050715">Yes, that would, and I think this Court has begun to address that, particularly last term in the W.R. Grace case where an employer enters into a conciliation agreement with the EEOC, they may abrogate an existing collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3489.849" offset="14108289">However, you must remember in this case we do not have an enforceable collective bargaining agreement.</text>
