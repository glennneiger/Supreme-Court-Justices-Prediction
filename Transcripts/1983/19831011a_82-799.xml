            <text syncTime="62.848" offset="400005">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="66.595" offset="415051">The question presented by this case is a straightforward one.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.064" offset="432919">It is whether Congress intended for union dues or the federal taxpayers to fund the travel expenses and per diem of federal employees who represent their unions in collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.758" offset="491643">Federal agencies pay such expenses for their own representatives at collective bargaining sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.555" offset="518914">The question here is whether the Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.898" offset="532289">The Federal Labor Relations Authority, correctly concluded that Congress also meant for the agencies to fund the similar expenses of the union representatives to those sessions.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.471" offset="586519">The statute the Court must construe in this case is Title VII of the Civil Service Reform Act passed by Congress in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.356" offset="626121">Title VII establishes a statutory framework for the federal labor management relations program.</text>
            <text syncTime="126.711" offset="655483">That program formerly had been governed by executive order, and under the executive order program the unions bore their own travel expenses and per diem.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.456" offset="702503">There was no entitlement under the executive order program to any reimbursement from federal agencies for those expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.655" offset="739283">Title VII sets out a series of detailed provisions governing the federal labor relations program.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.639" offset="767182">None of those provisions addresses the subject of travel expenses and per diem.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.246" offset="789647">The Authority has cited Section 7131 of the statute, and that section relates to authorization of official time for employee union representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.224" offset="841579">In Section 7131 Congress went quite far in subsidizing the collective bargaining process in the federal sector by providing for federal payment of the salaries of the employee union negotiators.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.438" offset="906363">The question here is whether the Respondent, the FLRA, correctly concluded that Congress meant to go further in subsidizing the collective bargaining process by funding another category of expenses, the travel expenses and per diem of the employee union representatives.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.602" offset="1131016">Now it also meant that you did not lose time in terms of accruing other benefits such as pension rights and so on, but the basic principle was that official time meant payment of your salary.</text>

            <text syncTime="342.954" offset="1520449">What they were in fact doing was extending the provisions under the executive order program in which official time had been available up to a particular ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.433" offset="1558379">Now under the executive order program the reasoning had been that it prevented delay.</text>

            <text syncTime="571.188" offset="2433376">--Well, I think the terminology "official time" is what they picked up from the old executive order program, and I think it is significant that they used that term as opposed to some other term they might have used.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.466" offset="2478516">But you have the very careful consideration in 1978 about how much farther than the executive order program you ought to go and to what extent the federal government ought to be subsidizing the collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.022" offset="2536717">In essence what Congress did was to provide this subsidy of the salary expenses, but it did not go further.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.503" offset="2570676">Now we think there are numerous indications that Congress itself did not intend this sort of requirement and moreover that it did not intend to delegate any sort of discretion to the Federal Labor Relations Authority to impose that sort of requirement either.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.073" offset="2636923">I will summarize those points briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.056" offset="2648834">First, as I have mentioned there is total silence in the language in legislative history, and that silence occurs in the context of both the existing federal sector practice and the private sector practice in which unions bore their own expenses of collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.016" offset="2716753">Secondly, as I referred in response to Justice White's question the use of the term "official time" is significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="651.401" offset="2754265">That is a term that had a particular meaning in the context of the federal labor relations program.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.118" offset="2777148">Congress picked up that term.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.009" offset="2784671">Third, what you have here is the Authority reading into the statute a requirement that has the effect of imposing a monetary liability on the federal government, and you have that reading in the absence of any expression of congressional intent that it meant to go further and to provide this sort of subsidy in addition to what it had provided for in the terms of the statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="1049.870" offset="4348152">I think that general principle is certainly applicable here, but I think in this particular context in this statute you do have rather careful consideration about whether the Congress ought to go further in terms of subsidizing unions and subsidizing collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.127" offset="4421190">The fact that they did not take the step in this case I think is particularly significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.095" offset="4441043">I think one has to also consider the fact that the statute reflects the fact that Congress was aware that there was a source of union funds out there that unions would have dues with which they could pay such expenses and with which they had paid the expenses all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.056" offset="4524844">It seems to me that given the assumption that unions would have dues and that Congress was aware of this, it is even more inappropriate to assume that Congress without making any mention at all somehow felt it was appropriate to add on or that the Authority itself ought to go further and add on some sort of financial requirement that would shift the expenses from where they normally would fall and where they always had been to the federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.243" offset="4649605">Now all of these considerations I have mentioned have led all of the Courts of Appeal that have considered the issue other than the court below to conclude that the Authority exceeded its statutory discretion, exceeded its statutory authority in this case, and we think that is the proper conclusion based on these considerations I have suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.299" offset="4737899">Now I would like to briefly turn to the alternative argument that the Authority and Respondent, NTEU, have put forward and that is the argument that collective bargaining is somehow equivalent to be on-the-job or on-duty status and that that in turn leads to the conclusion that there is official business here and then you in turn reach the conclusion that travel expenses and per diem were intended under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.264" offset="4909680">I think that the language of the statute simply does not amount to what Respondents are arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.655" offset="4935280">Congress could have written Section 7131 with different language.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.510" offset="4954715">It could have said collective bargaining amounts to being on-duty status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.916" offset="4984286">Better yet it could have said collective bargaining for the purposes of Chapter 57, the part that relates to travel expenses and per diem outside of Title VII, collective bargaining shall constitute official business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1223.972" offset="5044576">It did not say any of these things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.752" offset="5055652">Rather the language that Congress did use was and the term of art "official time" which had this construction under the old program of no travel expenses, no per diem, that is, the unions for those costs and Congress also referred to the time an employee otherwise would be in a duty status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.804" offset="5151887">Now that language suggests that you simply cannot draw out the equivalency of collective bargaining and duty status that Respondents have suggested in this case, and we think the medley of various agency regulations and decisions that they have cited from different statutes and different periods of time simply do not add up to the conclusion they have drawn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.461" offset="5266513">I think if you look individually at those particular references and look at them collectively they do not lead you to the conclusion that collective bargaining is the same as being on the job or that Congress intended the Authority to be able to so define it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.535" offset="5330774">Ultimately in this case you keep coming back to the conclusion that the federal employee unions did not succeed in persuading Congress or in moving Congress to the point at which it concluded that there ought to be a federal subsidy for these particular expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.027" offset="5412798">You have Congress silent on the subject in the face of the existing practice in both the private sector and the federal sector under which the unions bore their own expenses under which each side to the collective bargaining bore its own expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.738" offset="5475597">You have Congress using a term of art "official time" that had a particular meaning under the federal labor relations statute and no indication in the legislative history that Congress intended to change that meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.421" offset="5534320">Finally you have no evidence in the statute that Congress intended to authorize the FLRA to go further, to go beyond what Congress itself had decided that it would provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.961" offset="5584475">You have no evidence that Congress intended the Authority to be in the business of shifting expenses from the unions to the federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.879" offset="5628152">Unless there are further questions at this time, I will reserve the remainder of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1387.731" offset="5699623">At issue here today in the first Federal Labor Relations Authority case to be heard by this Court is the Authority's determination that a federal employee union representative who is granted official time to participate in collective bargaining negotiations is entitled to receive a per diem allowance and travel expenses from the employer agency for travel in connection with the negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.659" offset="5803277">Now as the Ninth Circuit recognized in this case the Authority's determination is correct essentially for these reasons: first, because the Authority correctly discerned the congressional objectives underlying the federal sector labor statute and adopted an interpretation of the official time provision that comports with and furthers those objectives; and second, because employee representatives who are on official time for negotiations are engaged in official business within the meaning of the Travel Expense Act and are accordingly entitled to the payment of travel expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.455" offset="5958444">Now I intend to discuss both of those points, and in the process I also hope to discuss the ways in which the nature and scope and purpose of collective bargaining under the federal sector statute differs from bargaining under the old executive order program or in the private sector under the National Labor Relations Act because ultimately the test of the appropriateness of the Authority's determination is not whether it would have been appropriate under the old executive orders or in the private sector, but rather--</text>

            <text syncTime="2042.623" offset="8319182">--I think that perhaps more instructive than the various factors that support our view that it is official business, that time spent negotiating is official business is the fact that Petitioner really has not provided any reason why negotiations should not be considered official business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2065.847" offset="8412074">Petitioner suggested a test which says that official business... that an activity is not official business unless it is conducted under the direction of a supervisor or that the quality of the employee's performance can be appraised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.998" offset="8472678">However, the Petitioner has cited no support in statute or regulation or case authority for that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.056" offset="8500890">In fact, the authority cited at pages 42 and 43 of our brief which indicates that the official business designation is given to activities that are not directly mission related contradicts that contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.033" offset="8560763">That authority applies, for example, to employees who attend administrative employment-related hearings about, for example, their own suspensions or their own performance appraisal appeal, and it shows that it covers things such as going to meetings and conferences and seminars and that sort of thing which may or may not be directly mission-related.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.448" offset="8650415">Petitioner also points to the language of Section 7131(a) which specifies that an employee who is on official time will be on official time for the time that the employee otherwise would be in duty status.</text>
            <text syncTime="2143.472" offset="8722513">The Petitioner suggests that Congress intended by this language either to say that they were not really on duty time or that because they would generally travel and take meals while they are not on duty time that Congress meant by this language to preclude travel expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2160.743" offset="8791580">But suffice it to say that very similar language appeared in the Assistant Secretary of Labor's regulations under the executive order and there travel expenses and per diem were paid, but overtime was excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2173.225" offset="8841527">The language also appears in OPM's FLSA regulations regarding official time where it appears to be viewed merely as the restriction on the amount of unscheduled overtime that can be counted as hours of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.656" offset="8899309">So I think the most reasonable view of that language is that it is a restriction on the payment of overtime and premium paid to employees who are involved in negotiations and not on the payment of travel expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2201.633" offset="8955211">Petitioner has also suggested here today and in the reply brief that "official time" is a term of art simply used in labor relations programs and that it does not operate to signify entitlement to travel and per diem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.629" offset="9019159">Well, the term "official time" was used in the executive orders, and it is used in the federal sector statute, but it has no more artful use than to signify that certain activities are to be conducted on duty time, paid time rather than on nonduty time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.135" offset="9085197">This usage supports rather than defeats the notion that the employee who is engaged in activities that are conducted on official time is engaged in official business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.755" offset="9131695">So as far as our position that this is official business, that negotiations is official business I would point then to the way Congress characterized the time spent in the activity and the great importance that it attached to the activity, that is, that it is something that is in the public interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.963" offset="9228557">The nature of the activity, that is, that it is employment related.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.177" offset="9249350">It certainly seems to me that something that is federal employment related could fall within the sphere of official business and in fact as I indicated people who attend administrative hearings about their own grievances or suspensions or performance appraisal appeals are considered to be on official business and entitled to travel expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.323" offset="9333987">So I think all those factors point to the conclusion that these employees are on official business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2303.402" offset="9362304">Now I would like to address the deference point because when the Authority based on the goals and objectives of its statute also determined that employees are engaged in official business within the meaning of the Travel Expense Act the courts that ruled adversely on this issue and the Petitioner take the position that for that reason the Authority is owed less than usual deference because it refers to another statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.374" offset="9478183">Now first of all as both Judges Haney and Oakes pointed out in their dissents in the Eighth and Second Circuits this position of the Petitioner and the other courts is in error because first of all the very core of the Authority's analysis here is of the interpretation of the terms of its own statute, but in any event the notion that the Authority is necessarily owed less deference in cases such as this where in order to resolve completely an issue under its own statute it has to look outside in an ancillary fashion at another statute--</text>

            <text syncTime="3362.495" offset="13598634">We are not in any way suggesting that the FLRA should never look outside its own statute, and I do not want to leave the Court with that impression.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.069" offset="13632906">I think that the core of the analysis of the FLRA does encompass a reference to a statute outside of its own jurisdiction, and we suggest that that may diminish the deference that is due and we also suggest that the Authority is inconsistent with the general approach of the General Services Administration in this area in which the agency is in the best position to determine its own mission and to determine whether travel corresponds to that mission.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.165" offset="13745337">To the extent that Ms. Peters suggested that the term VII, I just wanted to indicate that it does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3407.304" offset="13777834">I may have misunderstood what she said, but the term "official business" shows up in the General Services Administration statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.192" offset="13809389">It does not show up in the federal labor relations statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.784" offset="13823809">I would also like to address the point that was raised about payment for witnesses at hearings and some of the regulations of the Assistant Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.437" offset="13866441">There is considerable authority in a lot of areas for payment in relation to attendance at official hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="3438.605" offset="13903117">The Comptroller General has approved that sort of payment not only in the labor relations area but in broader areas of personnel management.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.272" offset="13933732">That is not what we are talking about here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.162" offset="13945331">We are talking about collective bargaining negotiations where you do not have any sort of history of this sort of payment being approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3457.860" offset="13980126">In fact you have articulated understandings that travel expenses were not included within the concept of official time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.029" offset="14016802">There was also reference to Office of Personnel Management regulations referring to hours of work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.681" offset="14043342">I think if you look at those regulations that term is not any sort of substantive judgment about what an employee is doing during representation or collective bargaining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.444" offset="14086392">That is basically an accounting or reporting term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.508" offset="14102692">You put your hours into hours of work and you determine whether the minimum wage has been paid or overtime is required.</text>

            <text syncTime="3662.449" offset="14798490">It was articulated by Congress in the 1978 Act, and I think it is a foundation of the federal labor management relations program, but that general proposition is not enough to get us to the conclusion that Congress somehow intended to shift the expenses in this case from the unions where they had always been to the federal agencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.690" offset="14891381">The general proposition is simply not translated into an entitlement to federal reimbursement of the expenses here.</text>
