            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="10.775" offset="193806">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="14.838" offset="210106">The Federal Aviation Administration has been charged by Congress with the responsibility of promoting safety of flight of civil aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.643" offset="253260">The agency fulfills its statutory mandate in two principal ways, one of which is essentially legislative, the other of which can be described as law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.638" offset="301221">First, the FAA promulgates regulations prescribing minimum safety standards governing the design, material, construction and performance of civil aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.351" offset="352108">These standards take up more than 500 pages in Title VIX in the Code of Federal Regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="56.820" offset="378021">The second, the FAA tries to police the aircraft industry's compliance with these safety standards by reviewing design and performance data, conducting tests and deciding whether to certify that particular aircraft are in conformity with its regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.795" offset="453881">Congress has made it unlawful to operate an airplane that does not have a current airworthiness certificate issued by the FAA.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.261" offset="487736">These cases were brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act on behalf of the owners and passengers of two airplanes that crashed due to in-flight fires.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.757" offset="533711">Respondents sought more than $100 million in damages from the United States on the ground that the FAA was negligent in carrying cut its statutory responsibilities by certifying the airplanes that crashed even though they allegedly did not comply with the Agency's safety standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.326" offset="608003">The Ninth Circuit agreed with Respondents' arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.218" offset="623572">We have sought certiorari because we believe that Congress could not possibly have intended to expose the United States to tort liability to members of the general public for errors in carrying out its regulatory responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.054" offset="686893">Although the issues here are solely ones of law, I think it would be useful to begin by briefly describing the facts of these cases in order to show just how far reaching and unprecedented the Ninth Circuit's judgment in this case really is.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.234" offset="747602">The United Scottish Insurance case involves an airplane that was manufactured in the United Kingdom in 1951.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.043" offset="782919">It was sold to an air taxi service known as Air Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.463" offset="804549">In 1965 Air Wisconsin contracted with Aerodyne Engineering Corporation for the installation of a gasoline fuel heater, and as required by FAA regulations Aerodyne applied for what is called a supplemental type certificate authorizing the installation of the heater.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.643" offset="885319">In 1966, the following year, the airplane was sold by Air Wisconsin to Respondent Dowdle who owned Catalina-Vegas Airlines, another air taxi service.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.890" offset="930250">Between 1966 and the crash of that plane in 1968 Catalina-Vegas inspected its airplane on at least eight occasions including two major yearly inspections of the gasoline heater.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.694" offset="985525">The District Court found that the crash occurred because the gasoline line leading to the heater was not adequately clamped to reduce vibration allegedly in violation of the FAA safety standard prohibiting "excessive vibration in fuel lines".</text>
            <text syncTime="228.999" offset="1066714">The court held that the FAA was negligent in inspecting the airplane and in issuing a supplemental type certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.087" offset="1099001">The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgement, as I said a moment ago, agreeing with the District Court that the FAA was liable under California's law as a good samaritan.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.552" offset="1144872">The Ninth Circuit said that the government had performed a service for the Respondents within the meaning of the Good Samaratin Doctrine and that the government should expect that members of the general public would rely on its certifications of airworthiness.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="268.747" offset="1225643">The inspection would have taken place in 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.916" offset="1242361">The accident took place in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.978" offset="1250616">The facts of the Varig case involve conduct by the FAA, Mr. Chief Justice, even more remote than the three years that was involved in United Scottish.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.865" offset="1298158">The Varig concerns the crash of a Boeing 707 on a flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="297.517" offset="1340790">The FAA had issued a type certificate for the Boeing 707 in 1958, 15 years prior to the crash.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.310" offset="1375899">The plane involved in that case had been sold by Boeing to Seaboard Airlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.276" offset="1399827">In 1969 Seaboard Airlines resold the plane to Varig, which is the Brazilian air carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.428" offset="1428457">The Brazilian took the plane out of the United States permanently at the point, which had the result of voiding its FAA airworthiness certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.425" offset="1460431">Respondent alleged that the crash in that case occurred because the towel disposal area in one of the aft lavatories on the Boeing 707 was not designed to contain fires, allegedly in violation of the FAA regulations, and that the FAA was negligent in 1958, 15 years earlier, in not noticing this defect and in issuing a certificate for the airplane.</text>

            <text syncTime="360.334" offset="1592088">Yes, although the complaint in that case was not too clear as to exactly which certificate they were complaining about.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.957" offset="1614554">Now we understand from the briefs that Respondents in the Varig case were complaining about the issuances of a type certificate, which was the first certificate.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.706" offset="2045574">We believe that the decision of the Ninth Circuit is plainly incorrect for four reasons, any one of which would require reversal of the judgment below.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.683" offset="2097401">First, Congress did not intend to subject the United States to damages liability under the Federal Tort Claims Act for actions arising out of government regulatory activities, that is, for negligence in enforcing the law in requiring that third parties comply with the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.802" offset="2173887">Moreover, Respondents' claims are barred by the misrepresentation and discretionary function exemptions of the Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.221" offset="2207638">Finally, the FAA's regulatory activities even if they are to be judged against the standards of state tort law do not violate the Good Samaritan Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.621" offset="2249225">We think the most serious error of the Court of Appeals, certainly the one with the most damaging ramifications is its unprecedented holding that Congress intended to allow the courts to oversee government regulatory or law enforcement activities in the guise of adjudicating Federal Tort Claims Act suits.</text>

            <text syncTime="554.890" offset="2370224">I hope to discuss this, but there is, I think, a basic distinction between the sorts of operational activities that were involved in those cases and the regulatory activities that are involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.307" offset="2415886">I do hope to expand on that in just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.104" offset="2423096">It seems clear to us from the legislative history and the language of the Federal Tort Claims Act that what Congress had in mind in passing the Act was a sort of ordinary, common law, garden variety tort such as automobile accidents, malpractice.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.800" offset="2485894">On the other hand, it seems just as clear to us that Congress did not want the Act to be used as a way of challenging so-called governmental functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.313" offset="2528003">The legislative history is replete with evidence of Congress' concern that actions, for example, of the FTC or the SEC not be the subject of a challenge under the Federal Tort Claims Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.978" offset="2578576">Congress not only put in the disrectionary function exemption to take care of this problem but also emphasized the point by putting into the Act twice, not once but twice, the express requirement that the United States can only be held liable in circumstances where a</text>
            <text syncTime="624.737" offset="2649629">"private person under state law would be liable. "</text>
            <text syncTime="628.703" offset="2665512">This phrase appears not only in 28 U.S.C. 2674, which is the substantive liability provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act, but the precise same phrase appears in 28 U.S.C. 1346(b), which is the grant of jurisdiction to the district courts to hear Tort Claims Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.963" offset="2738550">This Court recognized the same basic point in the Feres case, which is one of the first decisions of this Court interpreting the Federal Tort Claims Act, but there the Court held that Congress did not intend to allow the government to be held liable for engaging in activities that are not even remotely analogous to activities that private parties undertake.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.314" offset="2823918">The actions of a government agency in enforcing safety legislation pursuant to a program of inspection and certification simply have no counterpart in the private sector.</text>
            <text syncTime="680.542" offset="2872924">These sorts of regulatory activities are a form of law enforcement.</text>

            <text syncTime="915.228" offset="3811660">For example, in Indian Towing 350 U.S. at page 64 the Court begins its opinion by saying,</text>
            <text syncTime="921.600" offset="3837156">"The question here is one of liability for negligence at what this Court has characterized the operational level of government activity. "</text>
            <text syncTime="930.814" offset="3873936">Four pages later on page 68, the Court repeats,</text>
            <text syncTime="938.059" offset="3902985">"It is hard to think of any government activity on the operational level or present concern which is uniquely governmental in the sense that it has not at one time or another been privately performed. "</text>

            <text syncTime="977.514" offset="4060764">The government had suggested that in the universe of operational activities there should be a distinction made between governmental proprietary activities and uniquely governmental activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="988.744" offset="4105695">What the Court said in that case is that when we are dealing with operational activities everything that the government does is governmental, and it is foolish to distinguish between proprietary activities and uniquely governmental activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1105.118" offset="4571197">Justice Jackson and two other justices dissented in that case on the grounds that what the government had been engaging in there was operational.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.050" offset="4610903">It was something like what private parties could do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.737" offset="4621665">Therefore, Justice Jackson thought the government should be held liable if it acted negligently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.487" offset="4640683">But Justice Jackson went on to point out the sorts of governmental activities that even he and the other dissenters agreed could not be the basis of a Federal Tort Claims Act suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.405" offset="4684359">I will just read one sentence from Justice Jackson's opinion because I think it highlights a distinction we are making here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1139.621" offset="4709228">Justice Jackson said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.837" offset="4714034">"When an official exerts governmental authority in a manner which legally binds one or many he is acting in a way in which no private person could. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.566" offset="4764921">"Such official should be controlled solely by the statutory or administrative mandate and not by the added threat of private damage suits. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.905" offset="4802328">So even the dissenters in Dalehite understood this basic distinction between operational activities that the government may engage in or private people may engage in and the quintessentially governmental activities of regulation and law enforcement which is what we have in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1446.709" offset="5937505">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.849" offset="5950149">The Congres in the Federal Tort Claims Act decided decades ago that the government should and will be liable if a private person in like circumstances would likewise be liable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.811" offset="6005946">Liabilty is, of course, limited to a finding of negligence, and legislative, judicial and policy decisions are outside the gamut, but in overzealous performance of their duties the lawyers of the Justice Department try to turn back the clock to the pre-Federal Tort Claims Act era when injured parties would have to go to Congress in private bills as they would if turned away here in order to resolve their problems with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1498.142" offset="6143246">In these cases, each of them, there can be no doubt that there was negligence on the part of government employees which attributed as a proximate cause to the death of 128 people and the total loss of two aircraft.</text>
            <text syncTime="1515.741" offset="6213672">Still, we are here 15 years after one of these accidents and 10 years after the other trying to enforce the liability which the Congress itself decreed more than 30 years ago.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard F. Gerry</label>
            <text syncTime="1589.290" offset="6507915">--The actual facts are, Mr. Chief Justice, at the time of the certification of the DC-3 the CAA did not conduct itself in the same fashion as it did in 1958 when it certified the 707.</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.175" offset="6567370">So I think that such liability would be remote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.017" offset="6578759">Between the time of the certification of the DC-3 and the time of the certification of the 707 the government had continued to permeate the field and to take over the responsibilities that had previously been conducted by private manufacturers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.372" offset="6652216">This all started with the private manufacturers doing all of the inspection, all of the decision as to whether or not an aircraft should be released, and then went on to where we presently are or were in 1958 where only after the FAA had inspected each and every part of the aircraft could an aircraft be released to be used by the general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.392" offset="6760258">So as a practical matter the answer to your question would be no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1656.576" offset="6776976">As a legal matter, if they negligently had done the same in that case as they had in this, I would think the answer would have to be yes because the rule as I understand it in the federal court is that the liability attaches at the time of the impact of the negligence, not at the time of the actual negligence itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.755" offset="6869763">We are here asking this Court to affirm these cases to send a clear message to the executive branch to accede to the wishes of Congress and to cease clogging the courts with this kind of litigation and to say to the Justice Department when it is clear that negligent errors have been made at the operational level which cause death, injury or destruction of property not to waste more of the public treasury in a futile struggle against the inevitable but to do as private industry and the insurance industry does, cut their losses by compromise and settlement and preserve the time of the courts for other possibly more difficult matters.</text>

            <text syncTime="3361.366" offset="13596189">Just a few things, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.318" offset="13607997">I am afraid I do have to respond to certain of the misstatements that Mr. Gerry made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.972" offset="13622625">Let me just respond first to one of the last things he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.377" offset="13636209">Respondent said he does not know where we got this notion that under the Good Samaritan Doctrine the reliance aspect requires a showing that other ways of protecting one's self were not exercised.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.526" offset="13688767">Let me just refer the Court to the note E to section 324(a) of their statement of torts which says,</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.099" offset="13715099">"The reliance must have induced the defendant to forego other remedies or precautions against the risk. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3397.628" offset="13741221">We cite this in our brief along with cases that have interpreted that provision that support our statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3403.551" offset="13764940">The Respondents have assured this Court that it need not worry about the peculiar result in this case because the Plaintiffs will always have to show negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.499" offset="13804751">Let's be clear what that means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.889" offset="13814260">There was no proof in this case, nor could there be in any of these cases that a particular FAA inspector went in, looked at a particular aircraft and determined that it was all right whereas the safety standards show it was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3429.631" offset="13869221">The proof in these cases as in this case in particular was the following: An inspection had to be made according to the Ninth Circuit before a certificate could be issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.175" offset="13911435">A certificate was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3441.938" offset="13918436">Subsequently, it was determined that the plane was not in compliance with some safety standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.953" offset="13938498">Therefore, the government had to be negligent in conducting its inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.231" offset="13955634">It is a res ipsa theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.325" offset="13963994">Now it falls down for a number of reasons, one of which is that it is based on this fallacious assumption that the government has some obligation under the statute the do a head to toe inspection of every airplane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.319" offset="14011954">I think it is important that the Court realize that that is simply not true under the statute or regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3471.535" offset="14036823">The FAA has never done anything more than conduct spot checks in particular cases, and it reserves the right in any particular case to inspect any part of the airplane.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.375" offset="14080186">It has no obligation under the FAA Act or the regulations to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.781" offset="14101816">There was also a grudging admission from Mr. Gerry that the manufacturers do in fact have a nondelegable duty to make an inspection of every part of their equipment to make sure that it is in compliance with the safety regulations and that they can be sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.755" offset="14177675">In this case, for example, Varig did sue Boeing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.053" offset="14194916">The passengers did sue Varig and Boeing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.301" offset="14207873">Aerodyne was sued.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.970" offset="14214560">This, I think, precisely shows the distinction between these sorts of regulatory cases and the operational cases that I was referring to earlier because in the operational cases the United States is the only possible defendant, and the Court referred to this, for example, in Rayonier in pointing out why the operational activities in that case were not immune from suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act, one of the things that the Court said was that if the United States, which performed these operations, could not be sued, the plaintiff could not sue anyone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.144" offset="14335246">But in these regulatory cases there will always be by definition a private party, a manufacturer, an operator, or an installer that will have failed to comply with the safety standards, and that operator or manufacturer is liable to people who are harmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.547" offset="14396895">This is a suit against the United States for damages because the United States did not exercise its regulatory authority to make certain that that manufacturer or operator complied with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.649" offset="14453319">Finally, while it may not be terribly significant here I cannot let the record reflect that there was, in fact, negligence in the issuance of the type certificate for that Boeing 707.</text>
            <text syncTime="3586.426" offset="14496369">There is zero proof in this record that the type certificate was in any way faulty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3591.816" offset="14517998">If in fact--</text>

            <text syncTime="3604.013" offset="14566795">That is disputed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.480" offset="14572647">If in fact the 707 that crashed in 1973 had a defect it is far from clear that it was a design defect rather than a production defect or a maintenance defect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3615.197" offset="14611517">Varig completely refurbished the inside of those planes after it took them out of the United States in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.426" offset="14640460">So those are the sorts of problems that would arise in cases like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.846" offset="14654044">There will never be proof of actual negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.862" offset="14662194">It will be a res ipsa theory, and this ties in with our argument that these are in fact discretionary determinations because under the statute it is clear that the FAA has complete discretion, which airplanes to inspect and how thorough that inspection should be.</text>
