            <text syncTime="73.259" offset="433330">The issue in this case is whether law enforcement officers must obtain a search warrant before they conduct a chemical analysis of a substance that is lawfully in their possession to determine whether it is an illegal or controlled drug.</text>

            <text syncTime="97.845" offset="531655">In May 1981 the employees of Federal Express, which is a private freight carrier, opened a cardboard package addressed to Respondents that had been given to Federal Express for shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.484" offset="586199">Inside the package was a tube wrapped in gray tape.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.447" offset="606052">The Federal Express employees cut open the tube and removed from inside of it a transparent container that consisted of four plastic bags, one inside the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.604" offset="650669">Inside the innermost plastic bag was a white powder.</text>

            <text syncTime="191.096" offset="904684">In fact, if this didn't constitute probable cause, then you're in the paradoxical situation... it's one of the oddities of the court of appeals opinion... that the court apparently thought that law enforcement officers were in the position that they couldn't do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.614" offset="958705">They would simply have had to allow this shipment to go through.</text>

            <text syncTime="209.149" offset="976886">According to the court of appeals, they would simply have had to walk away at this point.</text>

            <text syncTime="1109.928" offset="4580008">I think the best way to understand what a truly minimal intrusion a chemical analysis is is to use the court of appeals' own analogy, which was, of course, to the Walther case where the court held narrowly that the viewing of a film was a search subject to the warrant clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.572" offset="4666525">Viewing a film belonging to another person or listening to another person's tape cassette, which is a similar activity, is vastly more intrusive than conducting a chemical analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.841" offset="4715636">A film or a tape can reveal a great deal about a person's interests or tastes or thoughts or associations or political views or private life.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.507" offset="4758268">And a chemical analysis does not reveal anything comparable, because people simply don't lock their secrets into the molecular structure of a substance in the way that they might place private thoughts on a tape, or private activities on a film, or private effects in a locked container.</text>
            <text syncTime="1175.020" offset="4840397">And in this case, for example, if Respondents had not been implicated in a shipment of cocaine, a chemical analysis of that substance that the DEA agents... the Federal Express people and the DEA agents found, might have revealed that the white powder wasn't sugar, which is what it first appeared to be, but was actually baking soda or talcum powder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.095" offset="4916674">Now, it's just not the kind of invasion of privacy that reasonable people care about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.501" offset="4938303">And there is no basis for comparing that to the far more intrusive law enforcement measures that the Fourth Amendment properly regulates.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.777" offset="4979368">Now, as I understand Respondents' position, they don't squarely join issue with us on the question of whether the chemical analysis was a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and they instead seem to think that it was the steps leading up to the chemical analysis... the opening of the plastic bag and the extracting of a few grains of the substance... that constituted a search.</text>

            <text syncTime="1240.006" offset="5100263">Less than a gram and a trace amount I believe were the descriptions the agent used.</text>
            <text syncTime="1244.969" offset="5120116">As I said before, this was the opening of a transparent container which is the quintessential example of a container that can't support an expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.686" offset="5167032">The example the Court used in Arkansas against Sanders was a gun case, but however much a gun case reveals from the outside about its contents, a transparent container reveals much more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.984" offset="5208201">And if a gun case can't support a reasonable expectation of privacy, then, a fortiori, a transparent container cannot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1274.167" offset="5236935">And the next thing they did was to extract a few grains.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.072" offset="5248534">In our view this was simply de minimis, and therefore, not within the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.175" offset="5269014">But if it wasn't de minimis, there is no possible sense in which it was a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.057" offset="5288553">It must have been at most a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.839" offset="5299629">And the Court has said many times, twice last term alone, that a seizure can be justified on the basis of probable cause without a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1297.472" offset="5330140">And as I said, it's clear that the agents had probable cause here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1572.245" offset="6429268">The point I was attempting to make earlier is that the result which we maintain in this case would not require search warrants for all chemical tests, the vast majority of them are valid for other reasons, usually because there's a prior Fourth Amendment justification for the testing itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.752" offset="6527280">We are submitting that a search warrant is only necessary when the Government expands the scope of a prior private warrantless search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.917" offset="6563956">Now, our position here is very simply stated: that being that the opening of the baggies, the withdrawing of the substances and the chemical testing does in fact constitute a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.415" offset="6625918">There was no warrant present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.318" offset="6633546">Those items were discovered in a previously sealed and wrapped package which is clearly protected by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.084" offset="6668654">Therefore, because there was no exception to the warrant requirement present, Walther and a litany of this Court's decisions require the holding that the search was invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.064" offset="6720586">I would also submit to this Court that following Walther will further an important goal which has been identified at a number of this Court's recent Fourth Amendment decisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="1682.788" offset="6871469">And I think that the items which were focused upon by the four dissenters in that case are not present in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.444" offset="6914101">In particular, the fact that one of the major points made in the dissenting opinion was the fact that the condition of the packages or the containers within which were the films at the time the FBI was contacted to come and look at them was brought on by actions of the consignor of the packages themselves; in other words, sending it to a fictitious address, not picking it up for a lengthy period of time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.807" offset="7047534">The point being what was the recipient of the packages supposed to do except to try to find out who they belonged to.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.661" offset="7070940">And we simply don't have that situation here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.321" offset="7085569">The condition of the package at the time the DEA came upon it was due to circumstances which were entirely beyond the control of the Respondents.</text>

            <text syncTime="1774.476" offset="7238228">The standard which I was mentioning before and which the Court has identified as important is a single familiar standard to guide the police who are out in the field making on-the-spot decisions, and they have to know what rule is going to control their behavior.</text>
            <text syncTime="1794.801" offset="7319521">I would submit that by following Walther in this case, that standard will be not only reaffirmed but also be made clearer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1804.506" offset="7358287">After private parties have conducted a search of an item such as a package, the police can examine it to the same extent that the private parties did, but they can go no further if there is an expectation of privacy in that particular item without obtaining a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1822.839" offset="7431639">It's simple, it's identifiable, and it's easily implemented; and we submit that it should be followed in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1884.728" offset="7679175">You just go get a search warrant, particularly when search warrants are so easily obtainable.</text>

            <text syncTime="2097.829" offset="8531603">In Robinson, as you will recall, the Court held that incident to a valid arrest you can search the entire person of the person arrested, and in that case the issue was whether you could search a rumpled... rumpled up cigarette package containing cocaine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.771" offset="8611329">In Belton the issue was the permissible scope of a search incident to a valid arrest in an automobile.</text>

            <text syncTime="2615.045" offset="10600501">Assuming that the border search exception does not apply, I think the argument can be made that clearly you have an expectation of privacy in that package.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.616" offset="10654731">The question is whether due to the suspicious circumstances which you described, Mr. Chief Justice, there should be an exception allowing examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2638.253" offset="10693288">The argument can be made that that is in fact a search because it is a scientific entry of a place where you have a legitimate expectation of privacy, but due to essentially, I guess, the exigency of the situation and the suspicious circumstances, it may not be held to be a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.128" offset="10800808">I guess it's probably closer to the dog sniffing situation in United States v. Place, which although this Court held that that was not a search because there was no physical--</text>

            <text syncTime="2690.676" offset="10902999">And although I don't believe that that was clearly explicated in that... that opinion, that perhaps is the basis for it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.669" offset="10931002">There is no... there was no physical entry of the suitcase which was sniffed, and it was in a public place, and certainly there was no destruction of any of the contents of the suitcase.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.132" offset="10996831">So I don't think that supports the fact that there was no search here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.534" offset="11014385">I think it's been clearly recognized by this Court that although containers or packages are the items in which privacy expectation is recognized, the true principal privacy interest is in the contents themselves, as recognized in Chadwick.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.369" offset="11097768">Secondly, the Government has suggested that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to contraband or the molecular structure of contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.354" offset="11137683">They cite no cases in support of that proposition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.159" offset="11156909">I would submit that this Court's decision in United States v. Jeffers, which is cited in our brief, plus a number of other cases where there were an expectation of privacy... in pornographic films, or drugs, or illegal phone calls, illegal coins, what have you... has been found would support our position that the Government is simply incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.825" offset="11259623">I'd like to discuss the so-called plain view doctrine under the circumstances of this case, and my basic position is that it simply is irrelevant, and it does not apply for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2799.668" offset="11338930">Number one, application of the plain view doctrine ignores the fact that the expectation of privacy of Respondents is based upon the condition of the package at the time it was sent and not afterwards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2816.087" offset="11404654">But even setting that aside, the plain view doctrine applies to seizures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.512" offset="11430359">And as I've stated before, I've never challenged the seizure in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2829.106" offset="11456690">The police were in lawful possession of the package itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.909" offset="11471946">Now, at one point the Government in its brief calls the entry of the packages and the testing just another seizure in addition to the one which had already taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.946" offset="11516041">I would submit that that is just playing with semantics, and it just doesn't make any common sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.040" offset="11548432">The Government also cites the decision in United States v. Lisk, which is an opinion of Justice Stevens when he was a circuit court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2863.588" offset="11594617">There he stated, among other things, that a search involves an invasion of privacy; a seizure is a taking of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.853" offset="11627740">I would submit in this case that the package was seized when the DEA came into possession of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2878.308" offset="11653549">Everything that happened after that was a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.132" offset="11672775">The fact that what the DEA did to the package was a search is supported by Cardwell v. Lewis where the taking of paint scrapings was a search; Cupp v. Murphy where the taking of fingernail scrapings was a search--</text>

            <text syncTime="2937.700" offset="11891054">The second reason that plain view does not apply in this case is that it's well established that in order for plain view to apply, there's got to be an antecedent Fourth Amendment justification for the police officers' presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.428" offset="11949987">That clearly did not exist here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.600" offset="11958659">They weren't present to execute a warrant to make an arrest or anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="2958.891" offset="11975900">They were only here to seize the package, and therefore, there was no prior justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2966.628" offset="12006829">The third element is that their discovery of the evidence must be inadvertent, as recently established again in Texas v. Brown.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.296" offset="12061477">In other words, they can't have known in advance that they were going to seize the item that they seize.</text>
            <text syncTime="2984.299" offset="12077464">Here they clearly did know about it beforehand, and they found exactly what they were looking for.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.734" offset="12111214">Therefore, we contend that plain view, which only applies to seizures anyway, simply does not apply in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3002.289" offset="12149458">In conclusion, we... we submit that this case is governed not only by Walther v. United States but other well-established and longstanding decisions recognizing the expectation of privacy in packages; and we would urge the Court to affirm the decision of the United States Court of Appeals in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3041.305" offset="12305461">Mr. Chief Justice, just two points of clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.108" offset="12320717">If the Court disagrees with our submission and concludes that this is in fact a search, it does not follow, as... as has been suggested during my friend's argument, that... it certainly does not follow that we have to obtain a warrant which, as I said, would be extraordinarily burdensome; and it doesn't even follow that we have to have probable cause, because the privacy interests are so limited... we think so limited they're not a search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3068.443" offset="12414026">But if the Court concludes otherwise, reasonable suspicion would surely be enough to justify this sort of limited invasion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3077.008" offset="12448299">The second point is that when considering whether the chemical analysis is a search, it's important to remember that we're talking about substances that are already lawfully in the possession of the agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.576" offset="12494588">That means they can hold it in their fingers, they can feel its texture, they can hold it up to the light, they can taste it, they can smell it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3097.422" offset="12530010">I suppose in this case they could even have used it the way cocaine users use it... all without even conceivably violating any other Fourth Amendment interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.769" offset="12571388">And in light of that, it seems to make little sense to say that they couldn't take the more precise and obviously more desirable step of conducting a chemical analysis.</text>
