            <text syncTime="29.830" offset="252823">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="32.343" offset="262958">At issue in this case is the validity of a rule adopted by the Interstate Commerce Commission in 1980 that provides the Commission with authority to reject at any time tariffs filed by a motor carrier if those tariffs were adopted or published under procedures that are found to be in significant violation of a rate bureau agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.563" offset="335788">The importance of the rate bureau agreement is that it serves as the basis for the motor carriers' immunity from antitrust liability for jointly setting and publishing their rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.372" offset="379047">This suit is an attack on the rule as adopted and not as applied, and accordingly the facts are rather sparse.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.515" offset="403602">The rule was adopted in the aftermath of the enactment of Congress in 1980 of the Motor Carrier Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.349" offset="430978">The primary purpose of that Act was to increase competition among motor carriers, and one of the significant means for achieving that particular purpose was Congress' attempt to restructure the operations of rate bureaus.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.210" offset="486358">Rate bureaus had been created after 1948 when Congress adopted the Reed-Bulwinkle Act which conferred the initial antitrust immunity on rate carriers so that they could avoid the destructive competition that Congress had found to have existed in the past so that they could set their rates jointly in a way that would otherwise violate section 1 of the Sherman Act because the immunity was perfectly permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.437" offset="599311">During the 32 years that the Reed-Bulwinkle Act had been in effect both the Commission and Congress had become concerned about possible abuses in the rate bureau process, and some members of both Congress and the Commission began to doubt whether any antitrust immunity was appropriate at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.228" offset="662423">In 1980 Congress comprised on the issue and retained a certain amount of antitrust immunity for rate carriers but did so only in return on the condition that the rate bureaus themselves operate under very strict requirements so that they would be more open to the public and provide greater opportunity for competition among the motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.664" offset="764196">For instance, Congress required that bureau meetings be open, that the name of the proponent of any rate increase be disclosable, and that members of the bureau not discuss various aspects with published rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.652" offset="812157">With regard to enforcement under the Interstate Commerce Commission Act, however, Congress did not modify the Commission's preexisting powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.417" offset="839220">In its notice of proposed rule making the Commission explained that most of the requirements of the Act were self-fulfilling, but nonetheless adopted several substantive provisions designed to provide very clear guidance to the motor carriers with regard to precisely how they should operate in order to assure the continuance of their antitrust immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.168" offset="914243">The only one of those rules that is at issue in this case is the Commission's decision to adopt rejection, as it is called, of the carrier's tariff filing as a potential sanction in cases where the Commission finds after a hearing and the possibility ultimately of judicial review that the tariff is the product of a significant violation of a rate bureau agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.534" offset="995641">The Commission thereby asserted its authority in appropriate cases to declare the filed tariff to be invalid ab initio and thereby to subject the carrier to overcharged liability under section 11705(b)(1).</text>

            <text syncTime="340.095" offset="1493953">Presumably one of the purposes of the rate bureau review process was to make sure that the shippers have an opportunity to have some involvement in the negotiations for setting the rates so that if the meetings for the rate bureaus were closed to the shippers or if the shippers were in some other way excluded from that process so that rates were set higher than they might otherwise have been as the shipper had had an opportunity to participate and the Commission were to find in its own view that if the rate bureau open process had been allowed to function as it should have, that the higher rate would not have been set, then it might well be the Commission's judgment that that higher rate should not be permitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="407.789" offset="1764686">--Well, not nearly so much as the symbolization rule, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.320" offset="1782867">Frankly the problem inherent in the rate bureau process is one of general secrecy.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.334" offset="1806900">I mean the whole reason Congress modified the rate bureau process was to make it less secret so that it could well be that violations of the requirements for rate bureaus would simply make them more secret and, therefore, make it more difficult to determine whether there have been violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.465" offset="1875445">So I think there was an inherent difficulty in complying with the 30-day problem even before the Commission's budgetary problems, but certainly having less resources makes it much more difficult frankly to be able to investigate rate bureau violations within the 30-days.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.300" offset="1954753">Rationale for the adoption of the rejection remedy by the Commission was that it simply lacked an effective remedy for significant violations of rate bureau agreements under the preexisting law and that the adoption of rejection was a direct and efficient administrative response to the peculiar problems that have been created by the operation of the rate bureaus.</text>

            <text syncTime="599.874" offset="2532999">There are alternative remedies available, no question about that, but this Court has held in the American Trucking Association case before that you don't look down the list of provisions to see whether the specific one the Commission has sought to apply exist, but rather you determine whether given the mission of the Commission the particular enforcement device that it has in fact adopted is consistent with that mission, not with any specific provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="627.883" offset="2645117">I don't believe, frankly, that you can go through and find that...

            <text syncTime="644.494" offset="2711572">So in the absence of that it would seem to me that the structure of the Act does not in any way cavern the Commission's discretion to choose an enforcement technique that is appropriate.</text>

            <text syncTime="746.145" offset="3118142">Our position would be consistent with the earlier American Trucking Association case that Congress doesn't sit down and figure out every aspect of how the Interstate Commission is going to perform its job and that the specific reference to certain enforcement mechanisms in no way necessarily restricts the Comission from using additional mechansims so long as those satisfy the aim of the statute, which is the enforcment of the rate bureau agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="775.734" offset="3236529">So I do not believe that that setting out would necessarily preclude what the Commission has done here.</text>

            <text syncTime="799.879" offset="3333078">In holding that the Commission had no power to reject the rate that had gone into effect after 30 days, the court did reject additional contentions that had been made by the Respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.077" offset="3373829">First, the court held that the rejection authority mentioned in 10762(e) is not restricted simply to rejecting problems in rate filing procedural defects but is also available for substantive unlawfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.317" offset="3430776">Second, it held that the Commission's authority over rate bureau agreements was not limited to declaring them unlawful, but rather the Commission could also adopt sanctions in addition to declaring the agreement unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.144" offset="3478109">The court held, however, that free or post-effective rejection was inappropriate on three grounds: first, the dictionary definition of rejection, which I have already discussed; second, the court held that it would violate a statutory policy favoring stability of rates; and third, the court reasoned that prior decisions of this Court precluded rejection of effective rates.</text>
            <text syncTime="860.131" offset="3574031">This Court has held that the determination of how best to enforce the national transportation policy as embodied in the Interstate Commerce Commission Act is a matter firmly committed to the discretion of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Commission's authority in this regard does not depend upon the express provision of a specific power.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.051" offset="3649786">There is a legitimate, reasonable and direct relationship between the asserted enforcement authority and a mandate of the statute, and the Commission's rule must be upheld.</text>

            <text syncTime="968.220" offset="4006410">So the Commission would be obliged to do one of two things, either disregard the rate bureau operation problems or have to suspend every rate increase in order to investigate whether or not the rate bureau operation has been complied with.</text>

            <text syncTime="1321.663" offset="5420157">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.544" offset="5431755">I would first like to address some questions that were asked of counsel where we have a difference of opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.780" offset="5460699">First, Justice Stevens, asked whether there was a direct conflict between this case and the Aberdeen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1338.155" offset="5486194">We submit that there is, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.255" offset="5494553">The holding here is the Commission cannot retroactively validate tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.639" offset="5520153">The holding in Aberdeen is that it can.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.259" offset="5526632">There is a direct conflict, and I think you have to decide both of these cases together.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.953" offset="5545336">Justice O'Connor asked if this rule was the result of the problem that the Commission is complaining about about not having enough funds to check tariffs before they become effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.565" offset="5607820">This case does not involve that, Your Honor, because the type of violations we are dealing with here would not be discovered by the tariff examiners who look at the tariffs and determine whether they are tariff informality violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.357" offset="5678978">They do not look at substantive violations at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.517" offset="5687651">This is not involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1389.706" offset="5692353">The Aberdeen case does involve that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.538" offset="5703742">You also asked, Justice O'Connor, whether the Commission could reject a tariff when it lacks sufficient information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.668" offset="5756196">No, it would not reject the tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.861" offset="5768944">It would suspend the tariff ending an investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.003" offset="5781587">These are separate powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.513" offset="5787647">The tariff rejection power is simply to deal with tariff filing informalities, procedural matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="1420.238" offset="5814501">If the tariff is not filed in accordance with the Commission's tariff circular rules, it would reject it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.002" offset="5841564">If there is a substantive violation of the Act such as a violation of the rate bureau agreements, it would suspend the tariff.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.237" offset="5870508">Finally, Justice Stevens asked about the threat of antitrust liability, and you mentioned treble damage liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.256" offset="5918573">I would just like to mention that very recently the Justice Department brought a case, a criminal case, against some of the clients that I represent, a rate bureau, alleging just these violations, violations of rate bureau procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.266" offset="5974580">That case was dismissed and was turned into a civil proceeding, but the threat is even more serious than you suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.769" offset="6004673">I would like to begin by pointing out three misconceptions that are likely to arise from a reading of the ICC's decision and counsel's briefs: first, that the rule at issue interprets and implements the Motor Carrier Act of 1980; second, that the tariff rejection procedures satisfy the full hearing requirements of the Interstate Commerce Commission Act; and third, that the ICC will be in a position to exercise discretion in the matter of refunds to shippers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.586" offset="6163915">None of these statements are correct as I will show.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.359" offset="6178962">While the ICC's decision states that it is intended to interpret and implement provisions of the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, there is nothing in that Act even addressing this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.809" offset="6236744">The Commission admitted in its decision that it was concerned that in the Motor Carrier Act of 1980 Congress did not go far enough in providing remedies for violations of rate bureau.</text>
            <text syncTime="1538.447" offset="6287318">It, therefore, took it upon itself to provide this additional remedy, which is the subject of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.740" offset="6312500">Now, this is important because of what the Congress said in the Motor Carrier Act of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="1552.637" offset="6344056">I would like to quote.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.537" offset="6351683">Congress said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.039" offset="6357744">"The ICC should be given explicit direction for the motor carrier industry and well defined parameters within which it may act. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.794" offset="6392748">"It should not attempt to go beyond the powers vested in it by statute. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1568.324" offset="6406854">Now I'll admit that an agency ordinary should have some leeway in fashioning remedies for the statute that it is administering, but I think that this is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.023" offset="6457636">Since Congress, I think we showed in our brief... We have a different reading of the legislative history than counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.199" offset="6486371">Our reading of the legislative history and what we showed in our brief is that Congress was tempting to reign in the agency, and that they were being as explicit as they knew how to be in that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.449" offset="6543318">So in those circumstances we feel that the Commission went far beyond the power vested in it by adopting this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.763" offset="6576650">As to the question of the procedural rights, I would like to point out that this rule provides that the complaints will be filed with what is called the Tariff Integrity Board.</text>
            <text syncTime="1624.341" offset="6630880">Now this is a creature of the ICC.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.134" offset="6638090">There is no provision for it in the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.385" offset="6647076">This is an employee board that will act on these complaints that a rate bureau violation occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.323" offset="6686887">The Tariff Integrity Board's procedures, which were adopted by the Commission, provide that the proceedings will be informal, that no transcript will be made, that subpoenas will not be issued, and that oaths will not be administered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.041" offset="6745714">Now, the Tarrif Integrity Board does not itself act on the complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.725" offset="6768493">It forwards its recommendation to the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.366" offset="6779047">But the rules do not say what happens next.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.679" offset="6792212">Two things are possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.329" offset="6798900">The Commission can act directly on a Tariff Integrity Board recommendation, strike the tariff retroactively, in which case the carriers will have been denied these procedural rights that I just mentioned, or it can start all over again and file its own complaint using the Tariff Integrity Board's recommendation as a basis for its complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.264" offset="6890642">But if it does that it merely delays the proceedings and increases the liability of the carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.880" offset="6921048">As we pointed out, while the complaint has to be filed within 60 days after the tariff became effective, there is no time limit on when the Commission has to decide the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.069" offset="6977786">The tariff stays in effect and the Commission can drag on the proceeding as long as they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.741" offset="6996490">All increases that were placed into effect during this time would have to be refunded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1721.247" offset="7018537">So what the Commission is doing with this duplicative procedure is merely trying... if that way it proceeds... is merely dragging out the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1731.322" offset="7058870">There is no reason for this at all except that the Commission wants to bring this proceeding within its Tariff Integrity Board rule which is the place where it is stated that it has this authority retroactively reject tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1748.322" offset="7126789">So it just kind of made up this system so that it can bring it in within that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1754.486" offset="7151448">The third misconception I mentioned was the ICC's refusal to acknowledge that it will be unable exercise discretion in the matter of refunds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.118" offset="7221979">I think the best example of this is in the tariff missymbolization rule in the Aberdeen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.163" offset="7250191">That rule flatly provides that changes resulting in increases which are not identified by proper symbols shall be considered unlawfully published and filed and therefore invalid and not collectible such cases the lawful provisions will be those purportedly superseded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1799.146" offset="7330126">Now it is not difficult to imagine what happen if there is a violation of that rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.362" offset="7358965">First of all, as we pointed out in our briefs the ICC has jurisdiction to entertain shippers' complaints for overcharges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.096" offset="7389894">A shipper has to go directly to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.116" offset="7398044">It can either go to a state court or to a federal court, but in either case there would be no reason for the court to refer the matter to the ICC since it is a pretty easy matter to determine whether a tariff had been properly symbolized or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1829.947" offset="7453319">There will not even be any need for a hearing or anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.538" offset="7463664">If it is not symbolized, it is not symbolized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.710" offset="7476411">The court then will be faced with the rule which flatly declares the tariff invalid and not collectible, and the provisions of the overcharge statute which provides that all such charges are to be refunded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.760" offset="7540568">The court will have no discretion whatsoever in the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.721" offset="7552480">So the ICC saying that it has discrection means nothing in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.087" offset="7581946">In the case at issue here and the rule at issue here for violations of the rate bureau agreements, the ICC will have some discretion in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.725" offset="7628444">It can decide whether or not the violation has been significant as they put it in its order.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.370" offset="7654984">Now, there is no standard to determine what significant is, but even more important the ICC has boxed itself in.</text>
            <text syncTime="1889.567" offset="7691765">If it determines that a violation of a rate bureau agreement is significant, then the tariff is stricken, overcharges are due and owing, and a court will have to award them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.046" offset="7749757">The court cannot consider actual harm to the shipper, cannot consider the seriousness of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="1909.689" offset="7772327">The Commission has said it is going to do this in motor carrier cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.862" offset="7793016">Yet, in the cases of the railroads where it has authority to deal in the railroad section of the Act, the ICC can award overcharges or damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1927.331" offset="7842857">It has said in those cases that it is going to consider violations of railroad rate bureau agreements under the damage sections of the Act so that it will require the shippers to show or not show harm, but not so in the case of motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.890" offset="7909104">There is no reason for this distinction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.311" offset="7918821">Neither counsel nor the ICC has ever given us any reason why the railroads should be treated any differently than the motor carriers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.927" offset="7953303">Under the normal procedures before the Commission adopted this rule, if a shipper brought a complaint in court and said that there had been a violation of some provision of the Act, the court would have been free to decide whether damages were due at all, in the first place, and secondly, whether the shipper had been actually harmed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1989.211" offset="8090393">We submit that that is the only fair way to handle this, and that is the way that your decisions in Davis v. Portland Seed require.</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.827" offset="8132816">I would like to now turn to the authority of the ICC to retroactively invalidate effective tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2010.736" offset="8176493">I think counsel for the government put their finger on the issue here in their reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.748" offset="8196555">They said what the Commission is trying to do is create a basis for overcharged liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.072" offset="8221842">We submit that the statute says what is an overcharge and what is not, and that the Commission cannot create overcharge liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.178" offset="8262279">The overcharge provision of the Act states at paragraph 4 in the petition at the very last page of the petition if you would like to follow it,</text>
            <text syncTime="2047.058" offset="8321734">"The common carrier providing transportation or service subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Act is liable to a person for amounts charged that exceed the applicable rate for transportation or service contained in a tariff filed under the Act. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.478" offset="8383487">Now to me this means simply that if a tariff is on file with the Commission and a carrier charges more than is called for in that tariff that carrier is subject to an overcharge claim and must refund the excess.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.389" offset="8443151">It does not involve this problem at all, violations of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2081.542" offset="8459765">In the very next sentence the Act states... it provides for damages sustained by a person as a result of an act or omission of the carrier in violation of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.180" offset="8522250">Now, this is what we are talking about in the case of both missymbolization and violations of rate bureau agreements.</text>
            <text syncTime="2103.765" offset="8548581">We're talking about violations of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2106.887" offset="8561120">What the Commission has done is taking this whole Alouette case, which reached a strained interpretation of the Act and is trying to ride on it in this case by creating overcharge liability when there is none.</text>
            <text syncTime="2121.887" offset="8621097">I think we pointed out in our briefs that every other court that has considered that Alouette decision except the one that is on appeal here, the Aberdeen case, has rejected it and has said that there is no basis whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.888" offset="8689120">It has been rejected by the First Circuit, by the D.C. Circuit and by the Eleventh Circuit.</text>

            <text syncTime="2161.823" offset="8780862">Well, there are two points there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2163.375" offset="8787027">The first, Your Honor, I think we discussed it in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2168.007" offset="8805626">There is a recent case called the Central Forwarding case that discusses that at some length, and the point there is that the American Trucking case was decided before the Motor Carrier Act of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.366" offset="8859020">The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 set new limits on the Commission, and really... I think the Court said it is still good law, but it has to be read in light of what Congress said later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2193.625" offset="8908026">Congress said the Commission cannot go beyond the strict, statutory limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2198.199" offset="8926312">So, as I said, an agency ordinarily would have some leeway in this, but it cannot have that leeway here where Congress said otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.406" offset="8963197">Congress could not have made itself more clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.258" offset="8974586">I would next like to discuss the specific language of the Act, which the Commission says gives it authority to retroactively invalidate tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.959" offset="9045430">It relies solely on this rejection power in the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.162" offset="9066224">The rejection authority provides that the ICC may reject a tariff submitted to it by a common carrier under the tariff filing section of the Act if that tariff violates that section or requirements of the Commission carrying out that section.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.235" offset="9142501">That provision is just in there for that one purpose so that the Commission can reject tariffs at the outset that do not meet the tariff filing requirements either of the statute or of its own tariff circular rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.874" offset="9201016">It is not meant to deal with retroactive invalidation of tariffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2271.216" offset="9218361">It is not meant to deal with substantive violations of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.969" offset="9233407">At least two courts have held... The Delta case cited in my decision held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2282.684" offset="9264336">But it is simply to deal with tariff filing informality violations... formality violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.739" offset="9292549">It is not to deal with substantive issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.031" offset="9301639">The rate bureau agreement violations obviously do not violate either the tariff filing provisions of the Act or of the Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="2306.529" offset="9359631">So in the first place we are saying that the Commission cannot even use it in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2310.653" offset="9376140">However, they could in the Aberdeen case if that were the only issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2316.497" offset="9399546">I think Justice O'Connor put her finger on this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2323.880" offset="9429117">If you read the statutory scheme it is clear what the rejection authority is mean to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.854" offset="9452940">It is meant merely to get at problems right at the outset.</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.838" offset="9468927">There are no procedural steps to be taken.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.829" offset="9488885">If the Commission rejects it, that is it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.621" offset="9500065">Later on the Commission in other sections of the Act can suspend and/or investigate for substantive violations, and it can after a full hearing order tariffs canceled prospectively.</text>
            <text syncTime="2357.623" offset="9564013">Now, counsel said that their reading of the rejection authority would not make those other provisions superfluous, but we cannot see why the Commission would need them if they could do all this that they are saying they could do under the rejection authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.724" offset="9640395">If the Commission can come along three years or five years later and reject authority and render it invalid retroactively, it certainly has no need to suspend proposed tariffs or to cancel effective tariffs after a full hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2397.449" offset="9723360">I think the Court was correct, too, in saying that the plain meaning of rejection contradicts this interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.338" offset="9766932">The plain meaning according to court was to refuse to accept or to decline to receive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2419.443" offset="9811340">I think it is pretty clear that if that is the plain meaning... and I agree that it is... that Congress could not have intended the Commission to reject a tariff after it already accepted it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.560" offset="9855749">Congress would have used the word "strike", I believe, if it were talking about the type of authority that counsel has indicated that the Commission needs because to strike a tariff it could do that after it was already effective, strike it from its record.</text>
            <text syncTime="2454.987" offset="9953447">But, of course, if it had meant that, too, it would also have provided procedural remedies, and it would not have needed to provide for the suspension and investigation authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.292" offset="9994720">I think that is all I have.</text>

            <text syncTime="2471.947" offset="10021365">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.781" offset="10044666">Justice Stevens, I may have been a little short in my answer to your question on whether there was a square conflict between this decision and the Aberdeen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.277" offset="10078625">In our view there is a conflict over the interpretation of the rejection language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.432" offset="10099314">In order to avoid a conflict one would have to find that the missymbolization rule is itself an abuse of discretion or not consistent with the statutory authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.285" offset="10130661">So there is a conflict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.885" offset="10137140">It is not one that could not be avoided, but certainly an ample justification for having granted the writ of certiorari in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2508.992" offset="10169531">With regard to the scope of these various powers that are available, one point that I probably could have made earlier with regard to the difference between the suspension and the rejection authority that the Commission exercises here is that the power to suspend is expressly limited to the proposed tariffs whereas rejection is in no way limited to any kinds of times limits--</text>

            <text syncTime="2542.333" offset="10302860">The Tariff Integrity Board is made mention of, and the Commission at that time did expect that the Tariff Integrity Board would be the body that would proceed on these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2552.410" offset="10343193">However, the Eleventh Circuit declared the process followed by the Tariff Integrity Board to be unlawful, and the Tariff Integrity Board is for all intents and purposes defunct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.158" offset="10382168">It is the Commission's intention to follow a complaint and full hearing procedure just as it would on any other investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2598.049" offset="10525737">Finally, with regard to the American Trucking Association case, there is no indication in the 1980 Act that Congress in any way meant to modify that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.966" offset="10557398">It did restrict the Commission's authority substantively to deal with rate bureaus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.930" offset="10581221">It in no way intended to modify the Commission's ability to enforce the Act, and indeed expressly stated that it retained the same authority to deal with overcharges that it had always had so that American Trucking is still good authority and justifies rejection of the Court of Appeals' decision in this case.</text>
