            <text syncTime="209.375" offset="982416">This statute, generally referred to as the loitering statute, prohibits individuals from loitering or remaining in a public place for the purpose of soliciting or engaging in deviate sexual intercourse or other sexual behavior of a deviate nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.005" offset="1060888">Now, briefly the fact underlying the two cases before the Court are as follows:</text>
            <text syncTime="235.259" offset="1085965">The Respondent Butler, who was a known prostitute by the Buffalo Police Department, was observed for approximately ten minutes on a public street in the City of Buffalo waving at passing automobiles.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.150" offset="1137479">She ultimately entered one of those automobiles which then proceeded down a side street.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.221" offset="1157750">The police officer who was making those observations then went to where that car was parked and observed the Respondent Susan Butler engaged in an act of oral sodomy with the driver of that vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.445" offset="1210621">She was then arrested under the loitering statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.214" offset="1221697">Mr. Uplinger was arrested on a public street in a quiet residential area of the City of Buffalo following a direct and overt solicitation to a plain clothes Buffalo police officer to engage in an act of oral sodomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.092" offset="1285227">The police action in both of these cases was the result of a reaction by the Police Department to citizen complaints of these type of activities occurring in those two respective neighborhoods.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.750" offset="1339875">I will go into a little more detail of the facts of the case during the course of my argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.570" offset="1359206">At issue here is whether or not this statute represents a valid attempt by the state to control public order.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.842" offset="1392225">Our position as the Petitioner is that the state enactment is valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.810" offset="1412078">It is based upon a legitimate and a compelling interest in the control of the conduct that it prescribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.816" offset="1440186">Now, with regard to the compelling state interest, first I submit that the solicitations we are talking about here constitute a real harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="333.755" offset="1479892">They are a real annoyance to a general public.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.057" offset="1493057">They are conversations of the most intimate nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.409" offset="1506537">They are the most private of matters and they are delivered in a public form.</text>

            <text syncTime="699.950" offset="2944630">Secondly, these types of solicitations could also lead to a violent reaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.192" offset="3005652">And, beyond the fact that they are forced upon an individual in a public setting, they are so intimate in nature that I submit that a violent reaction could be generated by a solicitee when some one addresses his sexuality in a public street.</text>
            <text syncTime="734.540" offset="3083079">I further believe regarding the compelling state interest here that there is a real effect on minors.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.444" offset="3106693">There is an incident in the record... and I make this claim based upon what is in the record... that a mother was concerned about her son being apprehensive about going out into the street being solicited to engage in an act of oral sodomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.471" offset="3174716">I submit that there is a potential harm when the sexuality of a minor is addressed in a public street, not with the consent of the minor or his parent, but strictly is to the arbitrariness and discretion of a pure stranger.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.498" offset="3242843">Thirdly, I submit that this law acts as a deterrent to those minors who would solicit, either voluntarily or through coercion.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.254" offset="3277848">And, further, it prevents minors from being exploited by those who would seek to satisfy their own sexual desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.626" offset="3307418">Lastly I submit that we are dealing here with a public nuisance.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.994" offset="3324868">The record clearly establishes that businessmen were concerned about congregating groups of solicitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.100" offset="3353289">They believe that there was a problem that senior citizens and elderly people were somewhat apprehensive about going into the neighborhood to the stores and the to the restaurants that are located in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.094" offset="3409296">And, the citizens were apprehensive about walking outside their homes for fear of being solicited.</text>
            <text syncTime="821.462" offset="3430716">What you have in the posture of this case here is that these individuals have taken over the area of Genesee Street in the City of Buffalo and taking over the area of North Street and Delaware and North Street and Irving Place.</text>
            <text syncTime="835.186" offset="3485573">Having set out these compelling interests of the state, the speech and the conduct we are here now can be examined as it relates to the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.577" offset="3527160">First, in regard to the context of the solicitation, I don't think it can be disputed that the communications we are dealing with here are not ideas, they are not discussions of the issues or of opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="858.718" offset="3579719">There is no search for the truth here.</text>
            <text syncTime="861.003" offset="3588914">These are in no way at all a pursuit by man for his higher pursuits.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.240" offset="3613887">I submit that at the minimum these solicitations are lewd and perhaps they may be obscene.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.060" offset="3641159">These are not four-letter, sexual explicit epithet emblazed on the jacket of an individual to denote some political position.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.285" offset="3682014">These are solicitations which are wholly erotic in nature and they are merely meant to satisfy the personal and the selfish sexual desires of the solicitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.176" offset="3729557">Much of the conversations that we are dealing with here deal with the crime of prostitution and I submit are clearly not protective.</text>
            <text syncTime="904.264" offset="3761949">We submit that certainly an argument can be made, a strong argument I submit, that this type of speech should be denied, all constitutional protection based upon the content.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.506" offset="3810954">However, if somehow this speech is minimally protected with respect to the content, then I submit that in the context of which it is uttered clearly prohibits the implication of a First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.914" offset="3868528">We are talking about a public street here.</text>
            <text syncTime="932.683" offset="3875634">There is no right to privacy involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="935.385" offset="3886396">The solicitations are not occurring in one's home.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.520" offset="3898935">These are in a public area that belong to the citizens of their community.</text>
            <text syncTime="943.991" offset="3920878">They are delivered indiscriminately, with the key here that they are delivered without any indication at all on the receptiveness on the part of the solicitee.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.981" offset="3968839">As noted earlier, these solicitations involve the most intimate of matters and they are made without the consent of the solicitee.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.904" offset="4004470">Last and most importantly here, the solicitees' rights of privacy have been infringed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.724" offset="4031741">He is not only a captive listener here, but he is forced to respond even if by abrupt avoidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.366" offset="4070298">Someone directs a solicitation at that person, I would say that is much more intimidating than even in Colfax or in Laramie where the conversation was not directed at your personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="997.809" offset="4136127">Your sexuality now becomes a topic of conversation with someone who may be a total stranger to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.862" offset="4164339">Now, with regard to the overbreadth, Mr. Uplinger claims here and suggests that the statute overreaches with respect to his conduct as reflected in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="1038.036" offset="4297041">We have a Buffalo police officer who is standing on the steps in a private or in a quiet residential area of the City of Buffalo.</text>
            <text syncTime="1048.058" offset="4337061">Mr. Uplinger approached the Buffalo police officer and after the initial greetings then said to him, do you want to get high?</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.430" offset="4374572">The police officer responded in the negative, no.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.068" offset="4389201">Then a group of other individuals came over and they were involved in a conversation when a police vehicle arrived and the police officers inside asked the individuals to get off the steps and to leave the area.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.059" offset="4441132">At the time the Buffalo police officer separated himself from Mr. Uplinger and walked away from Mr. Uplinger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.732" offset="4471852">Mr. Uplinger then followed or pursued the police officer and asked him if he would come over to his house.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.670" offset="4511559">The police officer responded... He said, why don't you come over?</text>
            <text syncTime="1097.841" offset="4536218">The police officer then said I am afraid with the police, I just want to leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="1104.411" offset="4562550">This was the second time that the police officer refused an offer by Mr. Uplinger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.036" offset="4609048">At this point in time, and I submit in an offensive way and I submit without any receptiveness on the part of the police officer, Mr. Uplinger asked the police officer to come over to his house to engage in an act of oral sodomy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.080" offset="4673204">I submit here that the real argument that my opponent is addressing with his overbreadth question is that they are saying that since these type of solicitations don't both them, therefore, the public must tolerate them similarly to a publicly intoxicated person who would say that public intoxication doesn't bother me, why should it offend you?</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.385" offset="4810399">If there is one instance where there may be a possible overbreadth, I submit, that is if an individual were to loiter in a public place with another person and that person is not a minor and he knows that the solicitee is receptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.299" offset="4890125">And, that one instance, I submit, there could be a possible overbreadth.</text>

            <text syncTime="1527.961" offset="6256747">In regard to the last issue, and this is under-inclusiveness, the opponent suggests that the New York statutory scheme is flawed because it prohibits solicitations or deviate sexual intercourse and not normal sexual intercourse.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.589" offset="6327278">I submit that New York does prohibit solicitations for normal sex under the general harassment statute and that statute, however, does require an intent to harass.</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.564" offset="6375134">I believe that what occurred here is that the legislature felt that this type of conduct was so offensive to the general public that they decided to make this a strict liability statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.656" offset="6431454">In conclusion, I ask that this Court act on behalf of the citizens of New York and their right not only to privacy but tranquility in their neighborhood and I ask that you reverse the judgment of the New York State Court of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1670.087" offset="6825276">However, there were some things that they were saying that come through very clearly and while that has been mentioned briefly, I want to emphasize that the state is asking this Court to go beyond its jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1721.703" offset="7031643">In other words, in the petition for certiorari, they were saying what I say which is that the Court of Appeals did construe the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.893" offset="7064453">When they got into the main brief, they were saying somewhat the same thing as I indicate in my responding brief, and then when they got to the reply brief, as a result, I believe, of my having raised the issue in Point Two of my brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.885" offset="7128401">They come up with the concept that I am not certain I fully understand that is based upon, I believe, a misreading of the decision Ward and Gaugh versus Krinsky.</text>

            <text syncTime="3261.738" offset="13191839">In the brief that the State filed there is a considerable amount of, I would call, slipperiness as to whether we're dealing with speech or conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.117" offset="13261325">When we're dealing with a question of whether vagueness has been violated, the State tends to refer to the fact that there can only be an arrest of there's actual speech, actual solicitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.943" offset="13312630">When we're dealing with a situation, however, where I'm challenging the statute as being vague... correction... I'm challenging the statute as being a violation of the First Amendment rights, then we talk about the fact that it really deals with conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.405" offset="13382533">I would respectfully refer the Court and recommend the reading of a case which was published after the briefs were filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.142" offset="13409492">The name of the case is Wirtz versus Risley, published in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in November 1983.</text>

            <text syncTime="3336.555" offset="13491098">It is 719 Fed. Second 1438.</text>
            <text syncTime="3345.911" offset="13528506">That was a stature that dealt with the question of a threat and of conduct that tended toward intimidation, and the court specifically talked in terms of the fact that the ultimate act could generally only be committed by some type of communication and therefore it tended toward pure speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="3365.658" offset="13607500">And therefore, dealing with the issues under the First Amendment, dealing with the problem of overbreadth being thrown up as an argument against the appellant, the court stated that: first, there is pure and we don't have to worry about overbreadth; and even if we did, there is substantial overbreadth here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.953" offset="13684718">I would submit to the Court that there is substantial overbreadth here as well because, although we have specifically here facts in this case regarding solicitation on North Street in Buffalo, what the State is arguing for is a general power to forbid any type of sexual invitation to come home, even in a gay bar, which is the fact pattern postulated in the reply brief.</text>
