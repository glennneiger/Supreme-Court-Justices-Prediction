            <text syncTime="72.262" offset="433145">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="79.000" offset="460103">This is an appeal from a district court judgment declaring unconstitutional and enjoining the enforcement of key provisions of FIFRA, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, the Act under which EPA regulates the marketing and use of what are now known collectively as pesticides, although at one time in the federal statutes they were referred to as economic poisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.006" offset="596149">Under FIFRA an EPA registration, which is essentially a license, is required in order to market a pesticide, and in determining whether to issue the registration EPA determines whether there will be unreasonable adverse effects on the environment, and makes that determination partially by consideration of health and safety test data which is either submitted by the applicant or cited by the applicant.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.048" offset="752257">The provisions struck down by the district court are those that permit EPA to consider the health and safety data submitted by one applicant and cited by a subsequent applicant in support of the application for registration by the subsequent applicant, while requiring that subsequent applicant, if the registration is granted, to compensate the first applicant for a portion of the cost of conducting the tests, and provisions requiring EPA to disclose this health and safety data to qualifying members of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.914" offset="963744">The court also declared unconstitutional the provisions providing for a scheme of compulsory arbitration if the two applicants are unable to agree or the terms of compensation, but the parties are in agreement that that provision was not ripe for review by the district court for reasons stated in the briefs, and I won't refer further to that aspect of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.035" offset="1088191">In many ways this decision is reminiscent of the constitutional litigation of the 1920's and the 1930's and again three terms ago in the Surface mining Act cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.763" offset="1163110">In striking down this major Congressional regulatory effort, the district court articulated its holding to be that Congress had exceeded its powers under the commerce clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.672" offset="1226745">Now, interstate commerce obviously is substantially affected by this industry--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="277.778" offset="1255166">Mr. Wallace, don't you think the district court meant that Congress had exceeded its powers unless it wanted to pay compensation?</text>
          </turn>

            <text syncTime="283.682" offset="1278781">--Well, that is probably what it meant, and I don't intend to belabor anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.420" offset="1301768">But I just do want to say that to the extent that this reflected what is discussed in the opinion, a reevaluation of the resolution Congress made of the competing policy considerations, that was obviously improper under this Court's decision, and Monsanto does not here try to defend the judgment on those grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.118" offset="1400511">But it is pertinent to say that the present statute evolved through a repeated process of amendment in which Congress gave detailed consideration to some of the problems of the industry that seemed to move the district court to reach the judgment that it did, as well as to advances in scientific knowledge about problems in the use of these chemicals on the health and environment, and as well as its own experience with earlier versions of the statute, which it concluded were having some undesirable effects, such as extending periods of patent monopoly beyond the expirations of the patent.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.468" offset="1605938">And in response to the expenses involved in research and innovation, Congress included a number of provisions in the statute, including a protection for trade secrets as defined by the statute, the provision for compensation for the second user of data, and a provision for exclusive use for a ten-year period.</text>

            <text syncTime="440.634" offset="1906660">The question is whether there's a constitutional impediment to the disclosure of the information under a different rule--</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="451.859" offset="1951486">--Yes, we are taking that position, and let me get to that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="458.762" offset="1979071">I think it is important for me to make a few general comments about trade secrets before getting to the specific questions involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.653" offset="2026719">This Court has never held that a trade secret can qualify as property within the meaning of the taking clause of the Fifth Amendment, and while in order to rule for us the Court need not preclude the possibility that in any circumstances a trade secret could be so protected, we do think it's highly dubious that a trade secret in any circumstances should qualify as property under the taking clause or that that should be the focus of litigation concerning disclosure of trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.766" offset="2199127">Now--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="514.499" offset="2202053">Well, certainly the district court thought that the law, the state law in Missouri created a property interest.</text>

          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="524.205" stopTime="549.522">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="524.205" offset="2240923">--I understand that, although we happen to think that that was an erroneous view of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.311" offset="2269344">But that certainly would not be dispositive of what the Fifth Amendment to the federal Constitution means, regardless of how Missouri might want to define it.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.285" offset="2321171">Let me try to explain the reasons why the Court should be hesitant--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="549.522" offset="2342173">Well, if the district court is right about what the Missouri state law is, why wouldn't we accept that and say, yes, it is property?</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="591.349" offset="2509462">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.115" offset="2512492">That's what I am attempting to do here, because the right to exclude is of a very different nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.121" offset="2544570">Let me, if I can, just make these general comments about trade secrets.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.375" offset="2569543">In the Kewanee Oil case in this Court, in a statement that was not disputed by any other opinion in the Court and that is entirely consistent with the holding, Justice Douglas, joined by Justice Prennar, said in the dissenting opinion:</text>
            <text syncTime="624.820" offset="2643313">"A trade secret, unlike a patent, has no property dimension. "</text>
            <text syncTime="630.807" offset="2667346">And then he quoted from the Court's opinion by Justice Holmes in Du Pont Powder Company v. Masland, an opinion that is discussed in the briefs in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.448" offset="2709873">But there is a great deal of additional basis for this statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.019" offset="2732129">In the first place, it probably has come to the Court's attention that the Restatement provisions referred to by the district court and by the parties here are not from the Restatement of Property; they're from the Restatement of Torts, the 1939 edition.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.432" offset="2817811">And while the origins of trade secret law and protection have not been considered to be property origins at all, in fact comment A of the pertinent section of that Restatement, 757, says:</text>
            <text syncTime="693.231" offset="2916972">"The suggestion that one has a right to exclude others from the use of his trade secret because he has a right of property in the idea has been frequently advanced and rejected. "</text>
            <text syncTime="706.307" offset="2969321">"The theory that has prevailed is that the protection is afforded only by a general duty of good faith, and that the liability rests upon breach of this duty, that is, breach of contract, abuse of confidence, or impropriety in the method of ascertaining the secret. "</text>
            <text syncTime="725.869" offset="3047584">Now, it's true, as the briefs point out, that trade secrets have certain of the characteristics of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.807" offset="3079349">They can be the res of a trust, they can be treated as property for purposes of certain transactions under the Internal Revenue Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.730" offset="3111009">But basically the law of trade secrets is a law concerning the regulation of commercial relations.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="751.669" stopTime="763.244">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="751.669" offset="3150715">Mr. Wallace, you speak of the law of trade secrets as though perhaps there was one fount for that kind of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.740" offset="3179032">Isn't the law of trade secrets derived from the law of the 50 states on the subject?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="763.244" offset="3197004">Yes, it is, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="765.679" offset="3206826">But it was this particular provision of the Restatement that the district court was relying on, and if I may just--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="775.951" stopTime="801.936">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="775.951" offset="3247891">Well, I mean, I think there's perhaps a little more implied in this question.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.105" offset="3264505">You say that the question of whether something is property for the takings clause purpose is a matter of federal law and not state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.163" offset="3312675">But can you recall any case involving the takings clause where this Court has said, even though something was deemed property under the state law, we deem it not to be property?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="lawrence_g_wallace" startTime="801.936" stopTime="853.302">
            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="801.936" offset="3351858">--I can't recall the Court specifically saying that.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.090" offset="3372443">Usually it has not been that specific about whether it wasn't property or whether it just wasn't a taking in the particular circumstances, although the Court came pretty close to that in a very closely parallel case, the Corn Products case, in which it rejected a property claim as to the ingredients of the syrup that were required to be placed on the label and said that disclosure to the public of what it is that you're selling is not something that can be recognized as property for purposes of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.429" offset="3513817">But I can't say that the opinion was quite that explicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.481" offset="3530013">But we really think the disclosure is covered by that decision in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="855.337" offset="3565435">If you start out as an initial matter by saying that before you can market corn products under the laws of this state you must disclose what is in it, that's quite a different question from saying after 15 years that, although you disclosed it, we won't let anybody know, to say that as of now we're going to start letting everybody know what we earlier said we wouldn't let anybody know.</text>

            <text syncTime="878.936" offset="3659790">I recognize that the effect of holding that this is a property interest protected by the Fifth Amendment would be that Missouri would have to freeze its own law with respect to trade secrets, or otherwise a change in the law would be a taking under the Fifth Amendment, and that is part of the reason why I'm trying to explain to the Court that trade secret law is basically a law of evidentiary privileges rather than a law of property, which is qualified by additional tort duties.</text>

            <text syncTime="923.696" offset="3838885">It can be sold in that way, but that doesn't mean that the protection... it can also be discovered through reverse engineering and through overcoming the qualifications on the privilege against evidentiary disclosure.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.324" offset="3905341">In this Court's opinion in Federal Open Market Committee against Merrill, the Court stated, in discussing the nature of trade secret law, that federal courts have long recognized a qualified evidentiary privilege for trade secrets and other confidential commercial information.</text>

            <text syncTime="965.958" offset="4007950">Let me suggest a possible analogy, hypothetical, but it's been in the Courts of Appeals.</text>

            <text syncTime="1980.767" offset="8067169">It would then follow that once it's available and out in the public that other competitors may seek to share the information.</text>

            <text syncTime="2054.565" offset="8362353">With respect to Monsanto Company, let me explain why.</text>
            <text syncTime="2059.886" offset="8383669">The company's development of pesticides has been detailed somewhat in the brief and I'd like to maybe go through that and explain exactly what we're talking about with respect to research and test data and registration of pesticides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.264" offset="8449079">The record indicates quite clearly that the development of pesticides is a risk-laden business, one that takes years and years to get going, let alone to be successful in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.088" offset="8504459">Many major corporations have dropped out of the business... Exxon, Clin, a number of others, Cities Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.492" offset="8534030">The company must make a commitment years and years before it gets to the point where it registers a product and ultimately recaptures its investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.181" offset="8572795">Monsanto Company, the evidence also shows, has been in the pesticide business since 1948.</text>
            <text syncTime="2113.786" offset="8599231">The agricultural products division did not really begin turning a profit until the late 1960's, mid-1960's, somewhere in that range.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.594" offset="8646461">Even with all these risks that the company goes through and everything else that's involved, the company is now, again the record shows, Baking about a five percent return on its investment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2137.734" offset="8695048">But in making all of these tremendous commitments of resources, the company, Monsanto, has developed one thing, and I think I can state it graphically.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.523" offset="8734128">It has been able to find a new pesticide, a new active ingredient, at the rate of one out of every 10,000 chemical compounds that it invents or discovers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2159.415" offset="8781775">That sounds like an extraordinarily low average.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.933" offset="8795777">In fact, it's twice as good as the rest of the industry is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.552" offset="8810301">Within the material that EPA wishes to disclose are the secret techniques and methods that Monsanto, after 17, 20 years, has used to start developing these new pesticides.</text>
            <text syncTime="2181.763" offset="8871114">Nevertheless, the last new chemical compound used as an active ingredient for pesticide that Monsanto has been able to discover was discovered and registered in 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.254" offset="8921060">All of the registrations that have come since then have been for expanded uses of this latest pesticide, which is called Roundup, uses in areas other that the initial registration, which may have been for one particular crop, it may have been one particular type of application, and so on and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2214.568" offset="9002353">And as Monsanto's research goes forward, they find different ways to use the same product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2220.971" offset="9027953">Now, we claim in this case that the trade secrets are property.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.923" offset="9043731">There is a fundamental disagreement between Monsanto and the EPA in this case, and that is with respect to the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="2234.196" offset="9080825">EPA has said throughout its brief and again in oral argument that Congress has created a good statutory scheme here, spent years developing and considering the various sides of the issue, and it had the right to reach the objective that it did, namely public disclosure and use.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.293" offset="9161282">And I might add as a parenthetical that I have combed the committee reports and the only thing that the Court will find when it examines in regard to why Congress passed the disclosure statute are about three lines cited in the Government's brief that say the public right to know.</text>

            <text syncTime="3063.577" offset="12398376">The framers when they developed the Fifth Amendment wanted to put a restraint on the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.964" offset="12415930">It is not Congress' choice to balance a private property right against the public interest, and that is essentially what the Government is arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3081.022" offset="12468175">The Fifth Amendment says:</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.740" offset="12479042">"Private property shall not be taken for private use without just compensation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.044" offset="12500253">Once the Court accepts the notion... and it has never accepted the notion... that you should balance, as the Government invites the Court to do, then private property is gone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.852" offset="12551453">It's difficult to think... for example, if that were the rule, and it is not, an individual in a town that has a parking lot that the town needs for a school... whose public interest should prevail there?</text>

            <text syncTime="3150.201" offset="12744864">But I'd like to address the question of whether this is property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.522" offset="12766180">The Federal Government does not define what is property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.474" offset="12777987">The Fifth Amendment defines it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.640" offset="12786660">And the Court has held in cases such as the Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies case, which relied upon Ross, that property is a broad and majestic term, and in fact I think there was one case where the Court said that it would denigrate it to say that property can be a horse trainer's license, but not the right to bring an action for discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.470" offset="12869938">But what it consists of is this: existing rules and understandings derived from an independent source, and the independent source generally is state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.361" offset="12909540">We have cited case after case from around the country dealing with state courts holding this is property within the meaning of the particular case involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.585" offset="12958441">We've also cited the Internal Revenue Service: When you sell a trade secret, treat it as a capital gain or a capital loss, because it is property within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code and has been for a long time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.845" offset="13015493">And I might also say that the Court in Kewanee, in Chief Justice Burger's opinion on two separate occasions, I believe page 479 and page 483 of the opinion, called trade secrets property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.272" offset="13073171">And the Department of Justice itself, which is now here representing EPA, told Congress in 1967... I want to quote this... that trade secrets were in fact property.</text>

            <text syncTime="3294.678" offset="13322797">The point here is that the existing rules and understandings not only are derived from state law; they're within the Federal Government itself and, I might add, within Congress as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.451" offset="13365847">Congress could not help but to operate within the framework of those rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.653" offset="13382670">And we have cited from the legislative history, Congress talked about the continuing proprietary interest of data submitters like Monsanto.</text>
            <text syncTime="3319.175" offset="13420808">They talked in terms and they legislated on the basis that the companies retained legal ownership of the data.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.364" offset="13449543">In fact, EPA told Congress that the data itself has a</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.482" offset="13470023">"continuing commercial value beyond the value that is used for achieving registration. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.355" offset="13501475">It is property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment by every standard the Court has ever set down, and congress knew full well that it was taking it away and it provided for compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.848" offset="13555496">Why else would Congress provide for compensation except to compensate the owner for something he's lost?</text>
            <text syncTime="3358.669" offset="13578797">Compensation for use, but for disclosure it set against an abstraction, the public right to know, against Monsanto's property rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.541" offset="13622265">The public right to know is not set forth in the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3372.993" offset="13636057">One can search the Constitution in vain.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.759" offset="13643058">That's simply another way of saying Congress has decided to regulate interstate commerce in a certain way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.413" offset="13669703">What is that way?</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.515" offset="13674092">Public disclosure, and we believe that public disclosure takes Monsanto's property, destroys it, and turns it into public information or a public library, and in doing that has violated the Fifth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3402.394" offset="13753608">Although it's not always dispositive, one of the principal indicia of whether Government regulation is permissible regulation or constitutes a taking is whether it applies to an entire category of persons or whether it singles out someone for special treatment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="3425.726" offset="13847022">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.044" offset="13852247">Even then, it may not be a taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3428.678" offset="13858830">But this is archtypical of the kind of adjustments of the benefits and burdens of economic life that reflect a change in the law that affects a whole category of persons, and Monsanto's benefits as well as burdens have been adjusted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.673" offset="13926748">It finds itself on both sides of the equation under the new rule in being able to rely in its own applications on other innovators' data and, while it cannot directly apply for them, in possibly being able to learn through the public disclosure provisions about testing methods of its own competitors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3470.907" offset="14027685">Now, the Court has several times held that the mere fact that this operates, this kind of adjustment of the benefits and burdens of economic life may operate, retrospectively as well as prospectively does not mean that it's constitutionally prohibited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.869" offset="14099574">That was specifically at issue in Andrus against Allard, where people had invested in eagle feathers and could no longer under the new rule, even Though they had bought them prior to the Act, could no longer market them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.378" offset="14157566">Their chief means of commercial exploitation was taken away because of important environmental concerns in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.615" offset="14190585">Here the rights that Monsanto has, as we have stated in our brief, are much greater in value than the rights retained by the owners there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3523.190" offset="14236874">Usery against Turner Elkhorn Mining Company was another example where the Court upheld retrospective imposition of very great financial burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.599" offset="14286506">And even in a case like Corn Products itself, it's not realistic to think that the Corn Products company, after all of its investment in plant, equipment and goodwill, had the realistic option of just going out of business rather than putting on the new labeling requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.727" offset="14359022">It doesn't make sense rigidly to distinguish between retrospective and prospective application of this kind of regulatory adjustment of the burdens and benefits, as this Court has called it.</text>

            <text syncTime="3575.174" offset="14444808">Suppose this material that was filed by Monsanto contained the formula, the development of something which they discovered by accident, which very often is the case, and they point out that its only utility is that it will, if it's sprayed on grapes, grape vines, it will destroy them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.840" offset="14535401">And contingency planners in the Pentagon say, well, we better have a contingency plan in case we get into a war with France, which isn't very likely, but let's have contingency plan where we can destroy their economy by spraying the stuff, and so we want this formula.</text>
