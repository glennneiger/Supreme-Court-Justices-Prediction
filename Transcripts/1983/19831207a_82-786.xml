            <text syncTime="27.563" offset="249708">A federal grand jury in Newark, New Jersey, was investigating corruption in the awarding of county and municipal contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.777" offset="286488">The grand jury issued five subpoenas for the records, the standard business records of sole proprietorships operated by respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.119" offset="323895">These documents included records such as general ledgers, bank statements, telephone toll records, vouchers, invoices, in other words, wholly business records, and the sort of records kept by virtually every business, no matter what its size or form of organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.095" offset="399755">When respondent argued that the act of producing these records would tend to incriminate him, the government offered in exchange for receiving the records not to use the act of production against him in any way in any subsequent criminal case.</text>

            <text syncTime="108.454" offset="573208">The district court held that even if such immunity were given and the evidence could not be used in any way against respondent in a criminal trial, he would nevertheless inevitably be incriminated in the eyes of the grand jury.</text>

            <text syncTime="141.393" offset="704970">Well, Justice O'Connor, our position is that the non-statutory constructive act of production immunity that was offered in this case is sufficient, but we also believe that statutory immunity would be available for the act of production and would also be sufficient in this area, and if the Court were to make clear in deciding this case that such statutory immunity would obviate any Fifth Amendment objection, then I think we would have no serious objection to such a holding.</text>

            <text syncTime="987.606" offset="4089812">The Fifth Amendment, the Court has held, applies only when a witness is compelled to make a testimonial communication that is incriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="996.961" offset="4127220">As the Court made clear in Fisher, when a document is voluntarily prepared before a subpoena is issued, obviously, no one compels the production of the document.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.519" offset="4173509">A subpoena that is later issued for the document may compel the witness to turn over the document, but it does not compel the witness to restate or reaffirm the contents of the document, and therefore the contents of the document as distinct from the act of production do not constitute compelled testimony, and they fall outside the privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.651" offset="4258041">Now, I would quickly add that there are undoubtedly certain highly personal documents... a diary is perhaps the best example... that may well be protected by other provisions of law, the Fourth Amendment or the First Amendment, but not by the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, which applies only when a witness is compelled to make a testimonial communication that is incriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.826" offset="4358769">The Court of Appeals and respondent attempted to distinguish Fisher on two grounds, authorship and ownership of the papers, and we think neither of these distinctions make sense either under Fisher's reasoning or under a protection of privacy rationale taken from Boyd.</text>
            <text syncTime="1071.696" offset="4426165">Under Fisher, of course, what matters is whether the documents were voluntarily created, not who created them and not who owned them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1080.348" offset="4460855">Fisher expressly rejected the idea of authorship as a distinguishing factor, and the idea of ownership as a sufficient basis for claiming the privilege had earlier been rejected in Couch, where the Court wrote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1094.936" offset="4519161">"To tie the privilege against self-incrimination to a concept of ownership would be to draw a meaningless line. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1164.987" offset="4799402">The same thing that is true for authorship is true for ownership.</text>

            <text syncTime="1552.719" offset="6350344">The other reason is that in the case of immunity for testimony, at least the procedures that have almost invariably been built into the statute worked to protect the government, because of the serious taint problems that can arise when immunity is given for testimony.</text>

            <text syncTime="1779.342" offset="7256793">I suggest to the Court that this is impermissible, and the Court should not sanction this type of investigative technique.</text>

            <text syncTime="1801.613" offset="7345923">In the District Court, the government made several major concessions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2366.086" offset="9603739">In any event, the point is that the government never did use the statutory immunity which they had the right to in the District Court, and I suggest to this Court that the reason they did not use that statute was because they themselves were unsure of what was to be immunized.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.058" offset="9731634">My argument today, briefly outlined, is that first of all, my client is entitled to the privilege on the protection of papers rationale based on this Court's cases from Boyd through Fisher and including Andresen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2423.000" offset="9831422">If not under the privacy rationale and the protection of papers rationale of those cases, then the compelled production of these documents in this case would amount to a compelled testimonial communication which is incriminatory as the Third Circuit and District Court found, and that based on that, his Fifth Amendment privilege would be valid.</text>
            <text syncTime="2449.363" offset="9936852">The government rests their argument completely on Fisher.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.865" offset="9950854">They pick and choose language from Fisher and disregard the context that that language is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2461.222" offset="9984291">The government ignores the factual background of Fisher that there, the documents that were being sought were being sought from attorneys, they were not the taxpayers' records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2474.091" offset="10035804">There was no compulsion upon the taxpayer in that case, and in fact the records were not his, but they were the work papers of the accountant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.538" offset="10073525">In numerous cases, this Court has recognized that the privilege belongs to the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.255" offset="10108424">In Wilson, the Court held that a corporation had no privilege, but the Court carefully distinguished the situation where an individual was involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.421" offset="10157117">In White and Bellis, I suggest the same distinction between a separate entity and an individual was made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.012" offset="10199435">In each of those cases, the Court was very careful to distinguish that the rights of an individual not to be compelled to produce incriminating private papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.316" offset="10244679">I suggest to the Court in those cases the Court was faced with a policy decision of whether there was an overriding governmental interest that the government had to seek access during the course of its investigations to the records of a collective entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2543.763" offset="10314478">The Court found that there was because of the scope of the economic activity of a corporation or a labor union or a partnership.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.044" offset="10351572">Here, the Court is faced with a somewhat similar policy question, but here, there is no overriding concern or governmental interest to seek the records of a sole proprietor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.331" offset="10408728">There is no mass abandonment of a... or there would be no mass abandonment of the corporate form of doing business or the partnership form of doing business to become a sole proprietor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.296" offset="10464630">There is no large scope of activity of sole proprietors that... The government makes a distinction between business and personal records.</text>
            <text syncTime="2598.103" offset="10531817">I submit to the Court that that distinction is invalid, that the only distinction that this Court has that finds support in the cases of this Court is the distinction between an individual and a representative of a collective entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2613.174" offset="10592108">There can foresee endless litigation over particular documents whether they are business or whether they are personal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.950" offset="10631187">In summary, I would urge this Court to affirm the decision of the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2632.056" offset="10667654">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="2661.014" offset="10783429">And the second point is just a point of clarification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2665.076" offset="10799729">We are not pressing the argument of non-statutory immunity in the case of immunity for testimony, but only in the very limited area of act of production immunity, where we think that the argument about the incriminating nature of the act of production is essentially academic, and where there are no serious taint problems.</text>
