            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="134522">We will hear first this morning Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Padungsri Phinpathya.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.859" offset="177885">Mr. Schulder, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="15.742" offset="197425">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="22.796" offset="225637">The question in this case is whether a deportable alien who first arrived in this country more than seven years before applying for suspension of deportation can establish physical presence in the United States for a continuous period of seven years when during that seven-year period the alien's illegal presence in this country was interrupted by a three-month trip abroad at the conclusion of which the alien knowingly misrepresented her immigration status to secure reentry to the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.530" offset="372550">The facts of this case are as follows: Respondent is a native and citizen of Thailand who first arrived in the United States in 1969 as a nonimmigrant student, and she was authorized to remain until July 25, 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.891" offset="438065">Her husband arrived in this country in 1968 also as a nonimmigrant student.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.765" offset="461575">He was also authorized to remain until July 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.836" offset="477771">Both Respondent and her husband remained beyond the July 25, 1971 date.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.040" offset="502640">The Immigration and Naturalization Service instituted deportation proceedings in 1977 charging that Respondent had overstayed her visa.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.780" offset="545585">Respondent conceded deportability but applied for suspension of deportation under Section 244(a)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.856" offset="589889">Section 244(a)(1) permits the Attorney General or his delegates to suspend deportation of an alien who shows that he was physically present in the United States for a continuous period of seven years immediately preceding the application for suspension of deportation who also shows that he was a person of good moral character during that seven-year period and who also is able to show that he is a person whose deportation would in the opinion of the Attorney General result in extreme hardship to the alien or to certain family members who are U. S. citizens or lawful resident aliens.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.883" offset="761983">In this case Respondent admitted that from January 1974 until April 18, 1974 she was absent from the United States when she and her two children took a trip to Thailand to visit her mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.315" offset="827707">The Immigration judge concluded that this absence was meaningfully interruptive of the continuity of Respondent's physical presence in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.591" offset="872847">The judge applying the factors developed by this court in Rosenberg v. Fleuti pointed to several factors, first, the length of the absence which in this case was three months.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.141" offset="931048">The fact that Respondent obtained travel documents prior to the trip and while she was abroad tended to demonstrate the deliberateness with which the trip was undertaken and pointed to the fact that Respondent had an opportunity to consider the significance of her trip on her immigration status.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.055" offset="1014640">Finally, the Immigration judge noted that Respondent knowingly misrepresented her status as the spouse of a nonimmigrant student even though her husband's student visa had expired approximately two and a half years earlier.</text>

            <text syncTime="244.141" offset="1111084">The husband's proceeding... The Immigration judge found the husband had met the requirements of the statute and was eligible, and I believe the judge found that the husband should be granted relief under the suspension of deportation statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.147" offset="1207110">The Board of Immigration Appeals reserved that and the Board in turn was reversed by the Court of Appeals so the matter was sent back to the Board of Immigration Appeals for further proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.953" offset="1250264">I am not aware whether any further proceedings have in fact been held with respect to the husband's case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Elliott Schulder</label>
            <text syncTime="294.735" offset="1313376">Petitioner reapplied for suspension of deportation before the Board of Immigration Appeals while after this Court granted certiorari she argued that more than seven years had elapsed since the 1974 trip and claimed that she was entitled to have her deportation proceedings reopened for a new application for suspension of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.740" offset="1409402">That application for motion to reopen is still pending before the Board of Immigration Appeals.</text>

            <label>Mr. Elliott Schulder</label>
            <text syncTime="334.329" offset="1471782">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.390" offset="1476066">The Board of Immigration Appeals affirmed the Immigration judge's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.434" offset="1504174">In addition to the factors mentioned by the Immigration judge the Board pointed cut that Respondent had overstayed her visa before her trip to Thailand and she reentered this country by misrepresenting her status.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.095" offset="1570839">According to the Board, the trip, therefore, substantially increased the likelihood that Respondent's illegal status would be discovered and that Respondent would be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.762" offset="1613471">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.774" offset="1625591">The Court concluded that the factors enumerated in Fleuti were merely evidentiary with respect to the significance of an alien's absence and that even if an absence increases the risk of an alien's deportation it cannot be meaningfully interruptive if the hardships associated with that deportation would be equally severe if the absence had not occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.552" offset="1732693">For the purposes of this case we accept the application of the test announced in Fleuti in the different context of suspension of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.731" offset="1785356">Since the Ninth Circuit's decision in Wadman v. INS in 1964, both the courts and the Board of Immigration Appeals have applied the Fleuti standards in determining whether an absence by an alien was meaningfully interruptive of the continuity of the alien's physical presence.</text>

            <text syncTime="456.550" offset="1960690">In fact, the Agency believes that there is room for flexibility in applying the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.753" offset="1981484">The problem here, however, is that the test created by the Court of Appeals far exceeds any flexibility that was permitted by this Court in Fleuti.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.639" offset="2025056">In fact, it wrenches the Fleuti test out of the context in which that test was created, and it produces wholly irrational results in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.079" offset="2078764">Fleuti, in fact, created a very narrow rule to deal with an exceptional situation where the literal construction of the statute would subject the alien to the sport of chance and meaningless and irrational hazards that were noted in the Court's opinion in Fleuti.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.661" offset="2157131">The Court relied largely on the analysis of Judge Hand in his decision in DiPasquale v. Karnuth and on this Court's earlier decision on Delgadillo v. Carmichael.</text>

            <text syncTime="518.640" offset="2209062">Mr. Schulder, is it not also true that the Court relied on the comparison of the test of residence where there could be more substantial interruptions under the residence standard in the Fleuti opinion?</text>

            <text syncTime="610.754" offset="2577493">As the Court had said in Wadman the Court believed that the word "continuous" in this statute should no more be read rigidly as the word "intent" or not intended in the entry provision of the statute that was at issue in Fleuti.</text>

            <text syncTime="1377.346" offset="5643851">As I was pointing out to the Court, the problem of the test that the Court of Appeals adopted here is that even where the Immigration authorities show that the alien has taken a substantial trip abroad, has falsified information in order to return, has obtained travel documents, all these factors are totally ignored so long as the alien can establish that there was no diminution of hardship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.729" offset="5785435">In our view this compresses two separate elements of the statute, the extreme hardship element that the Court dealt with in the Wang case and the continuous physical presence element that is involved here, into one element.</text>
            <text syncTime="1427.609" offset="5844889">In fact, in Respondent's brief at pages 19 and 23 Respondent's counsel admits that he cannot come up with any example of a situation where an alien could show extreme hardship but not continuous physical presence under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1446.450" offset="5920226">The upshot of the Court of Appeals' approach here is that it essentially converts the continuous physical presence language of the statute into a continuous residence requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.107" offset="5966933">In our view the test of the Court of Appeals would not be any different or lead to any different results if the statute simply said residence instead of physical presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1468.876" offset="6009983">But as I said earlier in response to Justice Stevens' question Congress inserted the words 1952 in place of residence in order to discontinue the lax practices and to discourage abuses that had arisen under the residence standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.337" offset="6083858">In order to give meaning to Congress' action here we submit that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed.</text>

            <text syncTime="2788.594" offset="11288808">My last point is simply that the Petitioner herein in their brief and in their argument is seeking to do basically what they are accusing Respondent of of collapsing two of the three elements of Section 244 into each other in effect saying that if the Immigration judge finds hardship do not worry so much about seven years and do not worry so much about good moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.119" offset="11438960">Respondent's position is that is not the situation at all that the Respondent believes that each factor of Section 244 shall be independently determined by the Immigration judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.255" offset="11483472">In fact, in this case the Immigration judge first made a finding on hardship before he even looked at the issue of seven years' residence or good moral character.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.503" offset="11536449">In summation, we believe that the standards set forth by the Court of Appeals in the Ninth Circuit describing a totality of circumstances test for adjudicating Section 244 is fair, and we do believe that the case is moot at this point and there is a proper relief before the Board of Immigration Appeals with the pending motion.</text>
