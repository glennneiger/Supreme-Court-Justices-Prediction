            <label>Justice William H. Rehnquist</label>
            <text syncTime="11.248" offset="148501">The city of Camden, New Jersey, a couple of years ago passed a law requiring that at least 40% of the employees of contractors and subcontractors who work on construction projects that were funded in whole or in part by the city money be residents of the City of Camden.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.450" offset="221330">The stated purpose of the law was to counteract widespread unemployment in urban decay in the City of Camden.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.178" offset="252259">An association of labor organizations representing employees in the building and construction trades who live outside of the State of New Jersey challenged Camden's resident hiring preferences as a violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of United States Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.410" offset="321118">That Section which is an Article IV provides that the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the Privileges and Immunities Citizens in the several States.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.532" offset="365630">The Supreme Court of New Jersey rejected this challenge on the grounds that since New Jersey citizens living outside Camden are as much affected by the law is the citizens of other States.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.605" offset="413905">Therefore, the Privileges and Immunities Clause didn't apply to the Camden ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.960" offset="435325">We conclude that Camden's ordinance is not immune from examination under the Privileges and Immunities Clause at the behest of out-of-state residents merely because some in-state residents are similarly disadvantaged.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.634" offset="490078">To read into the Clause of blanket exemption for all classifications that are less than statewide would provide States with two simple means for evading its strictures.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.940" offset="531247">In an opinion filed today with the clerk, we therefore reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.639" offset="554026">On remand, the City of Camden will have an opportunity to prevent evidence and support of its ordinance under the traditional constitutional standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.017" offset="587567">Justice Blackmun has filed a dissenting opinion.</text>
