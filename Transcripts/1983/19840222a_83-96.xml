            <text syncTime="66.042" offset="400502">This case involves the Import-Export Clause of the United States Constitution in Ohio's ad valorem personal property tax which applies to all goods used in business within Ohio regardless of their origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.718" offset="463196">This case presents two issues to the Court, both of which involve the scope of this Court's 1976 decision in Michelin Tire Corporation v. Wages.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.843" offset="507709">The first issue is whether the Ohio Supreme Court properly applied and interpreted this Court's decision in Michelin in its holding that the Tax Commissioner was collaterally estopped by this Court's 1945 decision in Hooven &amp; Allison Company v. Evatt from imposing its ad valorem property tax on Hooven &amp; Allison's imported raw materials which were no longer in transit or retained in their original packages and were held for use in manufacturing in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.045" offset="632470">Inherent in this issue is whether the original package doctrine upon which Hooven was based retains any validity with respect to Import-Export Clause cases subsequent to this Court's decision in Michelin.</text>

            <text syncTime="221.542" offset="1022425">The judgment upon which the Ohio Supreme Court based its collateral estopped decision was Hooven &amp; Allison v.

            <text syncTime="241.889" offset="1103823">I believe this Court has on at least two occasions determined that where collateral estopped is based upon a federal decision that the effect of that decision is a federal question reviewable by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="525.500" offset="2238269">Initially, the Tax Commissioner contends that Michelin effected a change in the legal principles upon which Hooven &amp; Allison v.

            <text syncTime="543.529" offset="2310367">The second contention of the Tax Commissioner is that Michelin's holding that a nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax imposed on imported goods no longer in transit is not an impost or a duty, and therefore is not prohibited by the Import-Export Clause, is controlling with respect to the assessment at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="565.058" offset="2396571">The holdings below by both the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals and by the Ohio Supreme Court were that the Commissioner was collaterally estopped by this Court's decision in Sunnen from imposing its ad valorem personal property tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="1553.165" offset="6349002">I'm a bit mystified by the position the Tax Commissioner is taking upon the procedural posture in which this case arrives at this Court, and I think it needs to be straightened out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.972" offset="6396231">If you look in the appendix in the cert petition, it is very clear at page 17 in the appendix to the cert petition that the Board of Tax Appeals specifically noted that Hooven &amp; Allison was raising not only collateral estoppel issues, but going beyond that and saying, and if, for some reason, you no longer think Hooven does state the law, you have to reach the constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.242" offset="6517230">And they state that specifically in their opinion, which is printed at page 17 of the appendix in the petition for cert.--</text>
            <text syncTime="1604.080" offset="6552652">They went on to find that the collateral estoppel arguments were well taken, because Hooven did remain the law, not having been reversed by this Court, which was the only court with the power to reverse it; and they noted that they lacked authority to decide constitutional issues as an administrative tribunal anyway; and they ruled in favor of Hooven &amp; Allison's position on collateral estoppel that the state could not in fact collect the tax it was seeking to assess.</text>
            <text syncTime="1633.883" offset="6671875">In order to protect its position before a court which could rule upon constitutional issues, Hooven &amp; Allison did file a notice of appeal in the Ohio Supreme Court which specifically stated that the Board erred in failing to find that the tax being sought was proscribed by the Import-Export Clause and the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution--</text>

            <text syncTime="1686.167" offset="6880959">The notice of appeal filed by Hooven &amp; Allison in the Ohio Supreme Court is not part of the appendix, but I was reading from the notice of appeal which was filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1701.094" offset="6940728">And finally, I note that in the Supreme Court of Ohio's opinion, the last thing they said in the final paragraph before holding that the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals is firm, that finding that the tax is barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, we decline to address the constitutional issues raised by Hooven in its appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.226" offset="7041247">And that's... that's printed at appendix A-9 of the cert petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.396" offset="7065906">So I think it is very apparent that the procedural posture in which the case arrives at this Court is one in which Hooven has argued all along below that this Court decided in 1945 that this very tax the State of Ohio now wants to exact and collect was unconstitutional, it has not been overruled, we never denied that Michelin required one to review the opinion and determine whether Hooven had been overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1764.015" offset="7192339">We said we read the opinion; we don't think Hooven has been overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.152" offset="7208953">The Court clearly has left that decision for another day, and it remains the law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1773.906" offset="7231941">Well, now, Mr. Nims, does something, in your view, turn on the question of whether when this Court says we leave the question of whether Hooven &amp; Allison I is still good law for another day, does that mean that this Court meant that only this Court was free to disavow that case in the light of Michelin, or perhaps, on the contrary, that any court having jurisdiction to consider constitutional questions could look at Michelin alongside Hooven &amp; Allison and say certainly the Supreme Court of the United States did not expressly overrule, but it's nonetheless clear that Michelin is inconsistent with Hooven &amp; Allison, and therefore, we decide that Hooven &amp; Allison I is no longer good law?</text>

            <text syncTime="1825.322" offset="7437576">Courts are obviously hesitant to predict what this Court would do on constitutional issues, but they clearly will do it if they believe they have an adequate basis for predicting it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.278" offset="7477387">But what turns upon that is the fact that the Tax Commissioner below didn't give the court any facts upon which to predict what this Court would do if it looked at the facts in the Hooven, because the Tax Commissioner chose below a different strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1853.425" offset="7550008">It said I'm not going to try and convince you, Ohio Supreme Court, that if you look at all the facts and examine the three policies behind the Import-Export Clause which Michelin said were important, and look at how this tax is applied, that you will find that this tax does not prevent the state or the nation from speaking with one voice on import-export policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.688" offset="7643003">You'll find that this tax does not deprive the federal government of the opportunity to collect the duties and imposts on imports.</text>

            <text syncTime="2082.267" offset="8465338">And does that really make any sense when you look at the policies behind the Import-Export Clause?</text>

            <text syncTime="2118.890" offset="8611833">They're not sitting there, held, ready to be sold, and as soon as Hooven &amp; Allison sells them, the state of Ohio will lose its opportunity to tax them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.778" offset="8647464">They're sitting in a warehouse for a period one, three, six months, depending upon how much backlog Hooven &amp; Allison keeps on their raw materials, and then they're moved onto the manufacturing floor, opened up, and become work in process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.157" offset="8712979">At that point, the full value, the full value of those imported raw materials goes into the tax equation and Ohio collects.</text>

            <text syncTime="2731.405" offset="11061910">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.444" offset="11102034">Just a few matters in rebuttal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.979" offset="11112169">The Tax Commissioner's position was initially that collateral estoppel did not apply because the controlling legal principle upon which Hooven was based had been repudiated or at least changed by this Court's decision in Michelin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2763.260" offset="11189387">There was no necessity for the Tax Commissioner to present any factual evidence with respect to that claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.297" offset="11217495">The only facts necessary for that determination are that the same tax... the same type of tax was involved... that is, a state nondiscriminatory ad valorem property tax... and that the imported goods upon which that tax was attempted to be imposed were no longer in transit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2790.710" offset="11299101">Michelin specifically held that such attacks on those goods is not an impost or a duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.447" offset="11322089">If it's not an impost or a duty, it was not immune, or it was not prohibited by the Import-Export Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2805.220" offset="11357198">The Respondent's attempt to put some burden on the Commissioner to prove its case is, I think, a disingenuous attempt to get this Court to ignore the clear ruling of the Michelin decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2823.081" offset="11428669">The... the Respondent in this case actually waived its right to an evidentiary hearing before the Board and chose obviously to rely on its collateral estoppel attack and abandon any attempt to actually prove any constitutional violation by the imposition of a tax in the present case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.364" offset="11517799">I would point out with respect to a couple of statements made by the Respondent regarding the notice of appeal and what was raised by the Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2857.354" offset="11565759">As I indicated in my opening argument, the Respondent did raise in his notice of appeal the Commerce Clause aspect regarding the federal regulation of foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2871.595" offset="11622706">That is the only portion of the Commerce Clause that was raised in the notice of appeal as the... as the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals at page A-17 of the petition for cert appendix reveals.</text>
            <text syncTime="2890.243" offset="11697312">With respect to Justice Rehnquist's question regarding custom-bonded warehouses, I believe that such warehouses would only protect imported goods from the imposition of a state tax if those goods are subsequently re-engaged in foreign commerce; that is, transported out... out of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.941" offset="11800025">If those goods are removed from a custom-bonded warehouse to some domestic source, those goods are subject to the tax in the jurisdiction in which those goods are located.</text>

            <text syncTime="2979.367" offset="12053727">Another point that I would make is that the tax at issue here is not a tariff, it's not a duty on the right to bring goods into the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.941" offset="12100016">It's a property tax that is imposed on goods after those goods have come to rest within Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.745" offset="12123317">It merely is a method by which Ohio apportions to the individuals who do business within the state the fair share of the cost of the government services provided to those particular businesses and individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.088" offset="12184652">In order to allow an exemption for Hooven &amp; Allison in the present case would require others within the state who are subject to the tax to subsidize the cost of those services provided to Hooven &amp; Allison.</text>
            <text syncTime="3025.682" offset="12238987">That is a requirement that Michelin specifically said was not required by the Import-Export Clause, and I don't believe that this Court should allow the Respondent in the present case to avoid paying its fair share of the cost of the government services that Ohio provides to it by paying a tax on the goods that it has in its Ohio warehouse awaiting its intended use in business.</text>
