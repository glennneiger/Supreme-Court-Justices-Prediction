            <text syncTime="54.551" offset="364054">We are here for three reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.587" offset="380145">The first relates to the closure of a suppression hearing over a defendant's objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.327" offset="427166">The second relates to the statute which authorizes warrantless seizure of "property subject to forfeiture", and it was upheld by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.141" offset="510339">And the third relates to the proper remedy when police treat an otherwise valid warrant as a license to conduct a totally indiscriminate search and a warrantless seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="113.439" offset="599574">I will address these issues each in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.577" offset="620158">First the closure.</text>
            <text syncTime="123.795" offset="641056">We respectfully submit that the Constitution guarantees open suppression hearings, that suppression hearings may only be closed upon a demonstration of compelling justification, and then only if no means short of closure will achieve the compelling state purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="177.782" offset="856932">Philosophically, the societal and defendant's interests are in this context so broad that we would not urge that the mere impaneling of a jury is the predicate for the position we urge.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.016" offset="961840">We say that, irrespective of whether a jury has or has not been impaneled, that the interests are so broad and so compelling that closure, particularly over a defendant's objections, as in this case, cannot be squared with the Sixth Amendment's commands.</text>

            <text syncTime="245.926" offset="1129546">The court refuses to suppress the evidence, it is then admitted at the trial, which is perfectly open.</text>

            <text syncTime="395.538" offset="1727959">We believe that openness is of equal significance and that it requires a new trial rather than sending it back for a suppression hearing.</text>

            <text syncTime="456.929" offset="1973510">It's too important from the standpoint of society, from the standpoint of the criminal justice system, and from the standpoint of the defendant.</text>

            <text syncTime="540.250" offset="2306832">No, the Constitution does not protect my discomfiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.320" offset="2335149">It does protect the discomfiture of the public, and that is one of the underlying reasons why we have open hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.009" offset="2373915">And to that extent, an affront to the public if there is an acquittal cannot be cured, and for that reason there should never be any countenancing of closed courtrooms under our scheme of criminal justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.708" offset="2468687">There was no justification for closure in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.967" offset="2521663">The state asked for closure on the basis of a state law that the state claimed would disable it from future use of wiretap evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.727" offset="2584775">Whether or not this is so is something that the Georgia Supreme Court did not decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.750" offset="2616854">And even if the statute were held to require closure in this case while the state played its tapes, the statute could not conceivably authorize closure for the rest of the seven-day hearing, and the tapes took two and a half hours to play.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.377" offset="2695326">Nothing in the record justified closure.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.167" offset="2726463">The Georgia Supreme Court said that the trial court legitimately balanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.756" offset="2756870">It balanced nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="654.539" offset="2763975">There was nothing in the record to balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.993" offset="2781843">The Georgia Supreme Court's ipse dixit cannot substitute for a trial court record that simply does not exist, and the trial court made no specific findings and closure was improper.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.638" offset="2860419">And of course, the court perceives, quite rightly, the question of remedy here, and I trust that I need not allude to that further.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.070" offset="2950072">Moving to the second issue, if the Court please, and that deals with the facial validity of Section 16-14-7(f) of the Georgia Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="716.414" offset="3011512">We submit that we're dealing with a very special and a very dangerous type of statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.452" offset="3047665">The statute purports to afford basic Fourth Amendment protections in authorizing the warrantless seizure of property subject to forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="743.231" offset="3118718">It permits a state officer to seize such property without a warrant only if he has probable cause to believe that such property is subject to forfeiture, and then only if he has probable cause to believe that the property will be lost or destroyed if not seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.600" offset="3232194">And the Georgia Supreme Court has construed the statute to permit warrantless seizure only if it is incident to a lawful search, arrest, or inspection.</text>
            <text syncTime="790.878" offset="3309308">That's pretty awesome stuff, and it seems to comport facially with the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.237" offset="3366777">Yet we nevertheless suggest to the Court that it is facially invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="810.125" offset="3386317">It is our position that the statute constitutes an open invitation to lawless police action so long as property subject to forfeiture is so broadly defined and so long as the judgment required to determine whether such property is associated with a pattern of racketeering activity--</text>

            <text syncTime="1171.093" offset="4830157">The mischief with this statute, if I may discuss that briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.568" offset="4880103">This statute authorizes police officers to do anything they want to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.840" offset="4921167">It's an invitation to anarchy in the context of search and seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.030" offset="4953977">In spite of the noble purposes set out in the statute and in spite of the gloss put on those purposes by the Supreme Court of Georgia, in actuality to expect a police officer conducting a search and seizure to determine whether he has probable cause to believe that all the property of an individual's home is subject to forfeiture or is part of a continuing criminal enterprise or is subject under RICO to forfeiture is like placing a 10b-5 statement before him and having him determine whether it complies with the securities laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.459" offset="5231711">In practical effect, such a statute would either never be applied because it is manifestly unreasonable to expect an officer to make such a probable cause determination, or the statute would be applied despite its purported probable cause requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.539" offset="5323975">In short, the statute would stand as an invitation to lawless police action, which is precisely, precisely, what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.482" offset="5383743">The fact of the matter is the statute is, as Justice Jackson said on another occasion, a teasing illusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.562" offset="5464096">It is like a munificent bequest in a pauper's will.</text>

            <text syncTime="1511.915" offset="6193539">They testified that it was their objective to seize evidence of assets so that forfeiture proceedings could be brought.</text>

            <text syncTime="1608.979" offset="6581719">As counsel for the Petitioners has pointed out, there are two separate issues presented to the Court, and I will address them in the order that the Petitioner, Mr. Shafer, has presented them to the Court this morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.286" offset="6626963">I would first like to address the issue of the closure of the hearing on the motion to suppress and the circumstances surrounding that closure and the state's justification for the closure of that hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.510" offset="6675864">The state sought to close the hearing on the motion to suppress pursuant to a Georgia statute requiring that there be no unnecessary publication of electronic surveillance evidence, similar to such concerns that had been expressed under Title 3 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.441" offset="6759561">So that the purpose of the closure was the protection of the privacy of other individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.327" offset="6783175">At the time the motion was made at the hearing on the motion to suppress, a colloquy took place between the court and counsel for all of the Petitioners present.</text>
            <text syncTime="1669.450" offset="6823613">Counsel for Mr. Cole, who is one of the Petitioners present in this case, concurred with the request and agreed to the closure of the hearing on the motion to suppress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.408" offset="6863423">As such, we would submit he simply has no cause to challenge the issue before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.710" offset="6884635">Mr. Shafer objected on behalf of his clients and urged that his clients did have a right to a public trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.566" offset="6916086">Once the court determined that closure would be effected, Mr. Shafer then requested that certain specified individuals be allowed to remain in the courtroom.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.440" offset="6955583">At the insistence of counsel for Petitioner Cole, all of the individuals were excluded from the courtroom except for necessary court personnel, counsel, and the respective Petitioners in the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1800.870" offset="7349301">The main thrust of the hearing on the motion to suppress was electronic surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.489" offset="7367796">That was... the majority of the motion to suppress was devoted to the electronic surveillance, the manner in which it was conducted, the persons who were surveilled, and various other things of this aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.964" offset="7413667">During the motion to suppress hearing there were references to individuals' phone numbers, other individuals who may have had their telephones tapped during this proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1828.337" offset="7459224">At the beginning of the motion to suppress, I don't know that the trial court knew precisely to what limits the evidence would go during the hearing on the motion to suppress, but we would submit that there was a justification at the outset of that hearing for closing the entire hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1845.716" offset="7528710">And we would also note that there is no attempt made at a later portion to request that the hearing be made open at any part, even after the tapes were played.</text>

            <label>Ms. Mary Beth Westmoreland</label>
            <text syncTime="3201.875" offset="12953298">They apply, but not to the same extent, Your Honor, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3204.993" offset="12965837">We would submit that the public trial right would not apply to this type of hearing in the same light the same type of restrictions might be placed upon a First Amendment type of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3218.985" offset="13021739">In the time that I have remaining, I would like to move on to the search and seizure issue that has been presented to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.656" offset="13048488">In beginning, I would note that, as pointed out previously by Justice O'Connor, the issue of the validity of the statute is simply not a question that is properly presented to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.981" offset="13101778">There has been no showing that any evidence that was admitted at the trial was not seized pursuant to the search warrants themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.904" offset="13133438">Evidence was suppressed which was allegedly seized outside the scope of the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.308" offset="13155068">The Petitioners have pointed to no evidence that was presented at trial which was seized outside of the scope of those warrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.295" offset="13182966">So we would urge the Court to simply decline to reach the challenge to the facial validity of the RICO forfeiture statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.714" offset="13216717">If the Court were to reach the facial validity of that statute, we would submit that it is clearly valid on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="3274.137" offset="13242421">It sets forth specific requirements which clearly comply with the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3280.207" offset="13266663">It specifically codifies various provisions of the Fourth Amendment requiring that the law enforcement officers be authorized to enforce the laws of the state, that they make a seizure pursuant to a lawful arrest, a search or inspection, that they have probable cause to believe the property is subject to forfeiture, and that they have probable cause to believe that the property will be lost or destroyed if not seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.422" offset="13367495">These four requirement clearly fall within the purview of the Fourth Amendment and, as a matter of fact, essentially codify Fourth Amendment principles in themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.797" offset="13408978">The statute does not give officers authority to extend the bounds of the search itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="3321.951" offset="13433637">The officers must be conducting a lawful search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.403" offset="13443459">It merely authorizes warrantless seizures under certain specified, precise conditions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.240" offset="13474806">We submit that this is no different from a plain view type of seizure, which has been allowed on prior occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.845" offset="13509183">In the same context, the plain view seizure does not enlarge on the right to actually search the area, but simply recognizes the fact that once an officer is in a position to observe the evidence, to observe documents, then to require that he obtain a warrant at that point could in some circumstances endanger the public, endanger the police, or could simply result in the evidence being destroyed or lost before a warrant could be obtained, and to require a warrant under those circumstances would be an inconvenience that is simply not required under Fourth Amendment principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.304" offset="13659022">Petitioners have also made a comment concerning a lack of notice and hearing provided in the statute, and we would submit that the statute itself, while not providing for prior notice and hearing, that under the circumstances that a seizure would be taking place that such notice and hearing prior to seizure is simply not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3398.951" offset="13741673">This is similar to the circumstances found in the Calero-Toledo versus Pearson Yacht Leasing Company case, in which the circumstances in the case justified the seizure of property without prior notice and hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.294" offset="13799038">The state's interest in obtaining in rem jurisdiction over the property and in enforcing criminal sanctions and preventing the loss or destruction of property, which quite obviously would be destroyed under those circumstances, justifies the statutory provisions which do not provide for the notice and hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.874" offset="13885347">The statute does provide for a hearing within a very short time period thereafter, and we would submit that that is clearly sufficient to meet the Fourth Amendment requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.432" offset="13927561">Finally, Petitioners assert that the search in question was a general search and that all evidence seized should have been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.538" offset="13964028">We would submit that there is no justification presented in this record for extending the exclusionary rule to such unreasonable bounds as to exclude every piece of evidence seized in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.345" offset="14015228">The evidence would not support a conclusion that the officers acted in flagrant disregard of the search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3472.999" offset="14037797">The warrants were valid on the face of those warrants, and there is no reason existing on this record to exclude evidence which was clearly lawfully seized pursuant to the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.372" offset="14079280">To do so would be to defeat the entire purpose behind the exclusionary rule and would serve no deterrent effect on the actions of police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.663" offset="14116478">Therefore, we would submit that the Court should not find a general search under the facts of this case, as they simply do not warrant such a conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.500" offset="14147825">In conclusion, Your Honors, we would simply urge that the Court conclude that there was no public trial right that attached, and even if the public trial right did attach at a suppression hearing it was not violated under the facts of the instant case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.843" offset="14205190">We would also urge the Court to conclude that the statute providing for the RICO forfeitures was not presented to this Court, as all evidence submitted at trial was seized pursuant to a valid search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3528.169" offset="14258480">Even so, the statute is clearly valid on its face and the facts of this case do not justify a finding that there was a general search.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.657" offset="14288468">Thank you, Your Honors.</text>

            <text syncTime="3580.519" offset="14467877">But realistically speaking, Mr. Chief Justice, the trial judge hearing the motion to suppress would be hard put to change his mind, and that is why we're asking this Court and the Constitution to make up his mind for him by ordering a new trial.</text>

            <label>Mr. Herbert Shafer</label>
            <text syncTime="3664.207" offset="14802663">I'm confused on that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.295" offset="14835055">Justice O'Connor suggested that the statute could not be properly addressed because everything that was illegally seized was suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3683.186" offset="14878522">Well, we really don't know what was suppressed, and we really... or rather, we really don't know that what was suppressed was all that should have been suppressed, because the trial court studiously refused to consider the validity of the warrant, and refused to consider the manner in which the warrant was executed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3703.666" offset="14960442">The trial court simply said, I ain't going to sit here for no nine hours and listen to a bunch of police officers come in and say how they executed the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3716.324" offset="15011120">So whether they in fact executed a general warrant, which would require suppression of everything, we don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3723.246" offset="15038810">We do know this, though: Some of the police officers who testified acknowledged that they conducted the searches and seizures under the authority of the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.923" offset="15101503">We do know that the Supreme Court of Georgia said that it was properly before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.743" offset="15128775">And we did everything in our power to make an evidentiary showing... we were frustrated by the trial court... in order to expand the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3756.651" offset="15172452">So minimally, if the Court has some doubts on the subject, we respectfully suggest that we ought to have a new hearing on remand on that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3766.157" offset="15210486">Finally, the suppression order entered by the court, the trial court, was not sufficient because this kind of indiscriminate search and seizure, a general search and seizure, requires suppression of everything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3785.320" offset="15287077">The failure to suppress everything, but allowing them to return those things that they have no use for, is an insufficient remedy under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3800.330" offset="15347159">And finally, if the Court please, Calero-Toledo had exigent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.234" offset="15370774">We don't have any exigent circumstances here.</text>
