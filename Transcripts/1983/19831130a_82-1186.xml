            <text syncTime="14.512" offset="204657">The issue to be decided in this case is whether the United States courts are dutybound to enforce the limitations of liability of the Warsaw Convention, and if so, how the Warsaw gold franc, which is the unit used to express that limitation of liability, is to be converted into present U.S. dollars.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="61.424" offset="392321">And will you tell us how they were lost as you go along?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. John N. Romans</label>
            <text syncTime="64.436" offset="404337">Your Honor, if I knew how they were lost, we might not be here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.087" offset="418965">All we know is that they were not delivered in London, and we could not find them anywhere in the system.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.382" offset="444147">We do know that the four cartons weighed 714 pounds, that the entire fee to carry them to London was less than $550, and we do know that Franklin Mint told TWA that one carton contained</text>
            <text syncTime="93.154" offset="519276">"metal stamping dies, metal stampings, numismatic, articles of adornment. "</text>
            <text syncTime="101.270" offset="551667">and that the three other packages contained "metal stampings, numismatic".</text>
            <text syncTime="108.626" offset="581134">Now, when the packages did not arrive in London, Franklin Mint made a claim, and it claimed that it was entitled to $250,000 because it turned out that metal stampings, numismatic, meant gold coins.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.216" offset="643514">Now, Franklin Mint knew that TWA's limitation of liability was $20 per kilogram, and that its overall liability was $6,500, based on the weight of 714 pounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.349" offset="723971">Franklin Mint could easily have avoided this limit of liability if it chose to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.603" offset="749049">It could have declared an excess value.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.923" offset="762319">It could have said, look, TWA, we have gold coins here, and they are worth $250,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.796" offset="785829">In that case, TWA would have said, yes, you have declared an excess value, and now we are going to charge an excess charge for this high value shipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.864" offset="818116">But Franklin Mint chose not to do that.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="170.655" stopTime="174.487">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="170.655" offset="829192">The procedure you just described is permissible under the Warsaw Convention?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_n_romans" startTime="174.487" stopTime="583.976">
            <label>Mr. John N. Romans</label>
            <text syncTime="174.487" offset="844552">Absolutely right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.079" offset="850926">No value was declared, and in the box for declared value, Franklin Mint typed in the initials NVD&gt; ["], which mean no value declared, and the gold, of course, never showed up.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.471" offset="916546">Now, on oral argument before Judge Napp of the District Court, he commented that Franklin Mint knew that there was gold in those cartons.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.874" offset="946116">Evidently the thief knew that there was gold in those cartons.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.006" offset="958655">Only TWA was left in ignorance.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.061" offset="970881">Now, we moved for partial summary judgment in the District Court to reduce our liability to our limit of $6,500, and the question before the District Court, as is here today, is, how do you convert these Warsaw gold francs into U.S. currency?</text>
            <text syncTime="227.634" offset="1057189">And we suggested two alternative conversion factors, one the last official price of gold, which would lead to the $20 per kilogram limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.251" offset="1103583">Our second one was the special drawing right, a unit of account of the International Monetary Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.096" offset="1135034">That would lead to a limitation of liability substantially the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.330" offset="1151961">Franklin Mint countered and suggested that the market price of gold be used as the conversion factor.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.063" offset="1182890">That would have led to a limit of liability approximately ten times higher, because the market price of gold at that time was roughly $420 per ounce.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.812" offset="1225836">The District Court held that the last official price should apply because that was the conversion factor that the Civil Aeronautics Board ordered the airlines to use in their current and effective order.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.882" offset="1294172">That was the conversion factor that all of the airlines listed in their tariffs, which are filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.416" offset="1316324">And that conversion factor constituted as close as anything the government's interpretation of how this treaty should be construed.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.514" offset="1356657">Now, the Court of Appeals affirmed, and after affirming it said, each choice has a powerful argument against it.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.850" offset="1398035">Enforcement by a court is impossible, so 60 days from the issuance of the Court of Appeals mandate, the limitations of liability of this treaty will be unenforceable in United States courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.391" offset="1468147">Now, I would like to briefly discuss the abrogation issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.226" offset="1495524">The Court of Appeals correctly stated that U.S. courts do not have the power, absent a Constitutional infirmity, to abrogate U.S. treaties, put that in a very succinct footnote, Number 26, and you are absolutely right.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.435" offset="1560307">Then it went ahead to hold that courts don't have the power under these facts to construe the Warsaw Convention in order to effectuate the intent of the drafters.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.783" offset="1609731">Here, I feel the Court of Appeals was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.336" offset="1623942">They lost sight, in my view, of the primary purpose of this treaty, and that is, it sets a limitation on liability and also a floor.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.114" offset="1671067">What is not always so readily recognized in the United States is that the laws of many countries, and there are over 120 which adhere to this treaty, the laws of many countries require limitations of liability which are much lower than the Warsaw Convention, and the Warsaw Convention says that the limit will be no higher than $20 per kilo, but it also says any agreement entered into prior to the loss which would result in a limit lower than $20 a kilo is void, so, the convention establishes both a floor and a ceiling.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.788" offset="1821741">The Court of Appeals based its opinion on the fact that one section of the Par Value Modification Act had been repealed, and that is when the world went off the gold standard and adopted special drawing rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.510" offset="1888614">They felt that it was impossible to select any conversion factor, and that therefore they were unable to construe this convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.369" offset="1952040">We submit that neither the Repeal Act nor the legislative history mentions the Warsaw Convention, and that in order for a court to find that a later past statute has abrogated a U.S. treaty, there must be clear intent on the part of Congress to abrogate that treaty, and there is no clear intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.364" offset="2044095">In fact, Judge Winter, writing for the Second Circuit, acknowledged that fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.488" offset="2060605">He said,</text>
            <text syncTime="479.259" offset="2063635">"Congress may not have focused explicitly on the convention in repealing the Par Value Modification Act. "</text>
            <text syncTime="486.292" offset="2091743">Well, we have researched the legislative history, and there is no mention whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.435" offset="2108356">Now, he must have then decided that legislative silence was sufficient to abrogate a treaty, and pursuant to the cases in this Court, Weinberger v. Rossi, for example, in 1982, legislative silence cannot satisfy the requirement of the clear expression to abrogate a treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="510.509" offset="2188605">Furthermore, the legislative history indicates that the Congress knew very well that there would be uses for the last official price of gold after the repeal of this one section of the Par Value Modification Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.587" offset="2249000">In the Senate Foreign Relations Committee report they stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="528.920" offset="2262270">"While it is the express intent of the IMF. "</text>
            <text syncTime="533.813" offset="2281914">the International Monetary Fund,</text>
            <text syncTime="535.705" offset="2289437">"to move gold out of the international monetary system, there are vast numbers of legal and psychological mechanisms that will perpetuate some role for gold. "</text>
            <text syncTime="548.693" offset="2341369">And it is our position that there are several roles of gold which are perpetuated today.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.068" offset="2366864">The preferred conversion rate is the last official price of gold, and the most important reason for, or the basis for approving that conversion rate is that it is the conversion rate favored by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.273" offset="2455681">The Solicitor General in his brief, and he is here to tell you today, favors the last official price of gold.</text>

            <label>Mr. John N. Romans</label>
            <text syncTime="844.529" offset="3524716">Well, actually, this question has been studied as late as 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="850.764" offset="3549689">There have been several conventions of the treaty partners, and in 1975, the Montreal Protocols to the Warsaw Convention were drafted and signed by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.380" offset="3600157">Those protocols increased significantly the limits of liability for death and personal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="870.736" offset="3629519">However, it was determined that the limit of liability for cargo should remain at the same level.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.142" offset="3671210">Now, that was expressed in terms of special drawing rights, 17 special drawing rights, but 17 special drawing rights amount to approximately $20 per kilogram, so that the parties felt that the limit for purposes of cargo should remain at that level, which is $20 per kilogram.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.957" offset="3762430">Now, you wonder why, after all these years, and I submit to you it is because of the advent, really, of the jet engine.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.482" offset="3792523">Planes today can carry efficiently much heavier cargo, and because the limit is based on weight, the weight of a heavy shipment will give that shipper sufficient protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.701" offset="3849365">So that if... For example, Italians ship shoes from Italy to the United States, and the Warsaw limit is almost always in excess of the value of the cargo of those shoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.459" offset="3900461">The feeling is that if you are shipping a very high value shipment, gold or diamonds, that all other shippers everywhere should not have to participate in the payment to ensure that extra risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.768" offset="3953646">If you are shipping very valuable cargo, you should pay an extra premium, and you can do that by declaring an excess value to the airline and paying the extra charge, or you can buy your own insurance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1024.726" offset="4245486">The United States is obligated to make its payments to the World Bank in United States gold dollars, but those gold dollars for all practical purposes of this argument are the same as the French gold francs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.884" offset="4298149">They are a unit of liability, and the United States as late as December 1, 1982, made payments to the World Bank and it used the last official price of gold to make that conversion, so that the last official price of gold is very much in effect today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.097" offset="4370978">It is being used by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1058.578" offset="4380905">They support its use for purposes of the Warsaw Convention, and I submit to you that that is the preferred conversion factor.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joshua I. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="1081.163" offset="4471289">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1086.047" offset="4490828">The United States has appeared in this case to urge rejection of the Court of Appeals' conclusion that the Warsaw Convention liability limitation for cargo is henceforth unenforceable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1098.877" offset="4542133">The overriding reason for the United States' concern about the decision below is that by judicial fiat it destroys the United States' commitment to an important treaty regime to which this nation has subscribed by the Constitutionally prescribed procedure of negotiation by the executive and advice and consent by the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.291" offset="4635756">Contrary to the Court of Appeals' view, this untoward result was not required by any Act of Congress, and we do not believe that it is compelled by any Article 3 limitation upon the power of United States courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1137.812" offset="4697823">Rather, we believe that the ordinary process of interpretation and construction of agreements, and treaties are in a sense an agreement, enables United States courts to give effect to the intention of the treaty parties that liability for carriers be limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.714" offset="4777444">The Court of Appeals purported to recognize that it is not the province of the courts to abrogate treaties, but I don't think there is really any basis for disputing that the result of this decision is to destroy the United States' commitment that liability of carriers will be limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.670" offset="4857274">The carrier in this case happens to be a domestic corporation, but perhaps this would be even clearer if you thought about a case involving a foreign carrier, perhaps even a foreign state carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1189.017" offset="4902727">The international conflict potential is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.777" offset="4917669">In light of the potential foreign relations repercussions of this decision and also the explicit Constitutional commitment of the treatymaking function to the executive, we submit that there simply was no sufficient justification for the Court of Appeals' pronouncement that the Warsaw Convention liability limitation cannot operate in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.753" offset="5013591">In treaty interpretation, the overriding imperative for the courts is to give effect to the intention of the parties, and in doing so it is necessary to take a liberal and, one might say, sympathetic approach to discerning the intent of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.794" offset="5077747">The intent may not always be perfectly clear, yet the Court should go the last mile to discern that intent and to give it reasonable effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.889" offset="5118185">In this case, we would submit that the Court of Appeals in its concern with the technical issue of which of the proffered standards of conversion was the technically ideal one lost sight of the fundamental point of the Warsaw Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.554" offset="5196866">The purpose of the contracting nations was to limit liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1266.716" offset="5213480">That much we are certain of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.679" offset="5221316">Various choices confronted the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.810" offset="5233855">The choice may not have been totally clear, but we do know this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.163" offset="5247230">The option it selected, no limit of liability, was the one choice that we can be certain was not intended by the contracting nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.917" offset="5282234">And for that reason, we submit that it was an impermissible interpretation of the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.062" offset="5302818">We don't find any basis in the repeal of Section 2 of the Par Value Modification Act for the Court of Appeals' conclusion that Congress intended to render a standard of conversion unavailable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.201" offset="5367393">The reasons for that are detailed in our brief, and rather than dwell on that somewhat technical issue, I thought it would be more pertinent to spend the time I have to address what seemed to underlie the Court of Appeals' concern about what it was asked to do in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1323.052" offset="5438864">The Court of Appeals seemed to believe that in this case it was asked to make a policy decision that lies beyond judicial competence, presumably because it was a non-Article 3 responsibility, but we submit that the kind of decision that the Court of Appeals was asked to make here was not of that nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="1343.977" offset="5522561">The relevant policy determinations are to be extracted from the Warsaw Convention and the negotiating history of that convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1352.551" offset="5556833">The convention is an agreement, as I have said before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.855" offset="5578045">Courts are frequently called upon in an analogous context to make the kind of determination the Second Circuit was asked to make here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.002" offset="5610645">For instance, in an ordinary private contract case which may come into a federal court in a diversity matter, if there is a clear agreement between the parties, and even if its terms are not perfectly clear, the court may be called upon to interpret it, and I don't believe it has ever been suggested that a court... that simply because the right answer, the right interpretation is not perfectly clear, that a court can throw up its hands and say, we are not sure if it was right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.379" offset="5732167">We can't decide this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.821" offset="5737914">It is non-justiciable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1399.602" offset="5745019">There are other contexts in which courts engage in similar determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.355" offset="5768007">We have mentioned some in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.798" offset="5773754">I thought another--</text>

            <text syncTime="1557.216" offset="6375511">No, we would read the plain... we would read the language together with the history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.829" offset="6397976">I think no one in this case has disputed that the language on its face is opaque enough in light of modern circumstances to require elucidation, and the idea of courts filling in blanks or gaps or ambiguities in federal law, and the treaty in this case is a federal law, is really not such an anomalous one as the Court of Appeals seemed to believe.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.540" offset="6528797">The examples are legion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1597.771" offset="6537679">In the case, for instance, of Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, this Court held in Textile Workers against Lincoln Mills that Congress unambiguously intended federal courts to decide these cases, cases concerning... that is, cases concerning collective bargaining agreements, and that the substantive law should be fashioned by the courts from the policies of the National Labor Relations statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.801" offset="6653767">So, too, here, if there is a gap in the substantive law relating to the conversion rate, the courts are provided with ample authority to discern an adequate conversion standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.571" offset="6708938">One more point that I think is useful in closing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.472" offset="6724507">The Court of Appeals saw this as a policy judgment, and it might well be a policy judgment if the question were, what standard of liability shall henceforth govern for this treaty regime in some abstract sense, but the court's task was not to legislate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.983" offset="6794515">The court in a sense put itself in the bind that it perceived.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.869" offset="6818129">The court's task was to decide the case before it, to determine an amount of money to be awarded, and in determining that a particular amount of money, $6,500 in this case, for instance, adequately comports with the intentions of the framers of the Warsaw Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.419" offset="6884272">We see that as something quite... to the traditional functions of the courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.563" offset="6908827">Accordingly, we submit that while the judgment of the Court of Appeals may be affirmed because it is consistent with our position, the court's declaration that the Warsaw Convention is henceforth unenforceable should be rejected.</text>

            <text syncTime="1713.218" offset="6999524">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.971" offset="7014466">This case is a perfect example of an issue which should be resolved by the other branches, but which by default has become a judicial problem, and a consequence of that fact is that no matter what this Court decides, the decision is going to be to some extent unsatisfactory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.843" offset="7102028">Now, before the Circuit Court, four possible ways of interpreting Article 22 were presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.740" offset="7133584">The Circuit Court held that as to each possibility, there were powerful, devastating arguments against each.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.877" offset="7170156">The Second Circuit's resolution of the problem was to choose a fifth course of action, and the government and TWA have been quick to point out the problems with that solution to the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.305" offset="7227834">Franklin Mint's position is that the gold franc in Article 22 can best be converted into United States dollars by reference to the free market value of gold at the time when the contract of carriage was breached.</text>
            <text syncTime="1789.387" offset="7304112">If the Court is unable to accept that conversion interpretation, the second best option is to adopt the conclusion reached by the Second Circuit, namely, that a political question is involved in making a decision as to the proper conversion factor, and that that decision really belongs to the other branches and not the judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.947" offset="7418423">Now, Franklin Mint's position that the free market price should be used really rests on three grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1824.579" offset="7444964">The first is, going back to what Mr. Justice Stevens was pointing out, the text of the treaty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.834" offset="7469937">The treaty says 65 and a half milligrams of gold, and what Franklin Mint says is that in this case the cargo should have been delivered on March 26th, 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="1844.404" offset="7524272">You look in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times, the Journal of Commerce, you find out what the price of gold is, and that gives you a limitation.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1904.673" offset="7765329">All right, but there certainly was, before the repeal of the Par Value Modification Act, there was quite a disparity, and nobody was objecting to the Warsaw Convention official rate price.</text>

            <text syncTime="1920.282" offset="7827710">What happened is that following 1968, when they went into this two-tier system, and there was a divergency between the official price and the free market price, starting in the early seventies, people started to say, how do we resolve this problem, and the Montreal Protocols that Mr. Romans mentioned was one way of resolving this problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.763" offset="7945679">So, yes, you are entirely correct in saying that when the Par Value Modification Act was passed, the problem was well known, but it was also something that, although not raised in the context of the Par Value Modification Act, was felt to be a major problem that should be resolved, and was being resolved through negotiation of treaties.</text>

            <text syncTime="1993.781" offset="8121744">First of all, on the standard form of a way bill, which is set by the International Air Transport Association, there are two boxes.</text>

            <text syncTime="2070.533" offset="8428735">--Well, if that is the case, why do you care, is it really a quarrel of the insurance carrier that is at issue here, wanting something back?</text>

            <text syncTime="2079.081" offset="8462903">Yes and no, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.681" offset="8469382">Yes in the case... in the context of cargo, because this case comes down to basically a dispute between the insurance companies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.668" offset="8509297">No in the context of passengers, because in international transportation, the only person that isn't insured by and large are passengers, and that also has to be seen in the context of the history of the convention, because when the convention was drafted in 1929... well, Lindberg crossed the Atlantic in 1927, Earhart did it in 1928.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.135" offset="8619116">Anyone who was flying planes had to be crazy, and certainly knew what the risk was, and one of the changes that has occurred since 1929 is, people willy-nilly hop on a plane to Montreal and don't know that the liability regime is drastically different than if they hop on a plane to go skiing in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.932" offset="8726322">So, the really... the real party with exposure in this situation are the passengers, and they are bound by the same gold franc unit, although the limits are different than cargo.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.536" offset="8808765">In addition to the text of the treaty, the Franklin Mint's argument in favor of the free market value is also supported by the intent of the drafters.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.865" offset="8862054">Now, the drafting minutes for the Warsaw Conference of 1929 are reproduced, the pertinent parts, in the Joint Appendix starting at Page 158.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.682" offset="8905313">And what that shows is that going into the final conference, the drafters had a limit based on a gold franc, and that has to be also seen in the context of the time, because prior to World War One, most of the major currencies were on a gold standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.294" offset="8983785">They went off during World War One, and following World War One, there was a great deal of economic instability, the classic example being the German hyperinflation of 1920-23, where people had to have a bushelful of Reichsmarks just to buy a loaf of bread.</text>
            <text syncTime="2227.646" offset="9057241">So, during the twenties, when the conference was being drafted, they knew the currencies could be radically devalued in a brief, short period of time, so what they took was international value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2243.748" offset="9121607">Going into the conference, they had this gold franc.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.421" offset="9136340">France, which had just a short time previously stabilized its currency by going back on the gold standard, raised the suggestion that instead of having the gold franc, why don't we just have the regular French franc?</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.809" offset="9197885">The Swiss delegates' response was, what happens if you redefine the French franc?</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.452" offset="9220454">The French delegates said, in essence, what difference does it make?</text>
            <text syncTime="2274.018" offset="9242711">The convention is only for a couple of years anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="2277.368" offset="9256085">The response to that was, I don't care if we take a gold dollar or a gold franc, but let's take a gold value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.855" offset="9294015">So, it was recognized then that the limit has to be based on a gold value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.592" offset="9324944">In the mid-1950's, there were a series of conferences to revise the Warsaw Convention, and in the Hague Protocol in 1955, the fact that a gold value was intended was retained in Article 22 of that protocol, which the United States did not adhere to, although they were one of the prime movers of the conference, and in that Article 22, the present Article 22 and the Warsaw Convention was kept, but there was a sentence added which said,</text>
            <text syncTime="2333.865" offset="9482097">"Conversion of the sums into national currencies other than gold shall in case of judicial proceedings be made according to the gold value of such currencies at the date of the judgment. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.233" offset="9523579">So, it was recognized in the mid-fifties that we are talking about gold, and in fact when the discussions leading up to the Hague Protocol were being made, the airlines themselves were offering as an argument for why they didn't have to increase the limit of liability the fact that the limits on gold had increased, and that therefore there was no reason to increase the number of gold francs because the increase in the value of gold had taken care of the problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.743" offset="9649594">So, the text of the treaty, the intent of the drafters supports the use of a gold value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.627" offset="9673104">And the final point is the practice in the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.480" offset="9688569">From 1934, when the United States adhered to the convention, until the present time, there has been no question that a gold value has to be used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.206" offset="9731409">What has happened is that the price between the free market value and the official price has... there has been a wide divergence, and the official price has now disappeared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.676" offset="9789297">The airlines were given a subsidy in 1929 in order to protect an infant industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2418.491" offset="9820539">The fear in 1929 was that with these new companies, a single crash could wipe out the company.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.716" offset="9857529">They would have problems in attracting capital.</text>
            <text syncTime="2430.219" offset="9867455">They would have problems in obtaining liability insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.953" offset="9882397">That has radically changed now, and in fact, as the Solicitor General's office pointed out, there are foreign air carriers that are agencies of foreign governments.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.780" offset="9933702">TWA itself is a big company and a subsidiary of an even bigger company.</text>

            <text syncTime="2664.340" offset="10803997">The conflict here involving the Par Value Modification Act and the treaty is much deeper, more fundamental, because what was being done by the Congress is removing an assumption on which Article 22 had been interpreted for the past 45 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.635" offset="10889156">In other words, an official price of gold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2688.627" offset="10901173">Now, the Article 22 as it now stands is a gold clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2697.513" offset="10936699">If you take special drawing rights or $42.22 per gold, what you are doing is changing that gold clause into a currency clause, and that is most clearly the case in the special drawing rights, because a special drawing right is just an average of five currencies, and what happens then is, a claimant's recovery rises or falls based on what happens to those currencies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2732.545" offset="11076820">What the drafters of the convention intended was that the recovery be tied to gold.</text>

            <text syncTime="2747.525" offset="11136693">That was the last official price of gold, and by taking a price, fixing it in time, what that means is, from here on in, a claimant's recovery rises or falls based on the value of 42.22, and not anything dealing with gold, and it was again, as I said, the drafters' intention to have it tied to gold.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.736" offset="11249542">Now, Franklin Mint's position is that Article 22 can be interpreted consistently with the text and the intent of the convention's drafters by using the free market price of gold.</text>

            <text syncTime="3325.632" offset="13449156">In a later order, and that is CAB Order 81-3-143, which is in the Joint Appendix before the Second Circuit, the CAB in an order dealing with SDR's dropped a footnote and said, and this order was in 1981,</text>

            <text syncTime="3513.217" offset="14199498">That type of ruling has traditionally been done in the context of criminal cases or this Court's decision on the Bankruptcy Code, and there is no reason that if the nature of gold changed as of April 1st, 1978, that that date should be used for the purpose of the Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.101" offset="14295001">Just to conclude, I would point out that the problem here is the fact that you have a convention drafted in 1929 for a different world, and the problem is trying to cram 1929 language into the realities of the 1980's.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.116" offset="14379116">It can be done with a bit of bootstrapping, but by and large it involves problems that should really be handled by the other branches.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.222" offset="14415478">The only way of doing it consistently is to take the free market value.</text>
            <text syncTime="3571.925" offset="14434286">Otherwise, the Second Circuit decision should be upheld but made retroactive as of April 1st, 1978.</text>

            <text syncTime="3735.914" offset="15090273">In my view, in order to effectuate the intent of the drafters, which has been restated as late as 1975 at the Montreal Conference, this Court should use the last official price of gold, because that would effectuate the intent of the drafters, just as in the Constitutional sense Judge Kaufman has said that we should not freeze the Constitution in 1787, I think, we should not freeze the Warsaw Convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.543" offset="15216810">The duty of this Court is to effectuate the intent of the treaty's drafters in the light of changing circumstances and in the light of the subsequent conduct.</text>

            <text syncTime="3788.406" offset="15300193">I should think it is the duty of this Court to effectuate that intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="3790.787" offset="15309806">Well, Mr. Romans, if for some reason the free market price of gold were the conversion factor, I suppose businessmen could protect themselves by buying gold futures or something of that sort.</text>

            <text syncTime="3803.928" offset="15362365">Well, I suppose that everybody could become a very sophisticated person, and I suppose we would have to adopt these kinds of things, buy and sell gold futures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.544" offset="15404787">I would suggest that that would add to the price of everything, but yes, that would be a way out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3822.651" offset="15437179">You could hedge every single transaction you made by buying gold futures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3827.312" offset="15455883">But I think, Justice O'Connor, you correctly stated that we are... a court's duty is not to decide what value should be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="3842.823" offset="15517950">That is the job of the legislature and treaty partners.</text>
            <text syncTime="3846.746" offset="15533623">And this Court is, of course, duty bound to effectuate the intent of the drafters.</text>
