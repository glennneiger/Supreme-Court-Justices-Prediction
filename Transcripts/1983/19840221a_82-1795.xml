            <text syncTime="35.839" offset="290672">The District Court found that it is infeasible for cable TV operators to delete the advertising from their programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="45.879" offset="330900">The Court of Appeals did not overturn that finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.414" offset="345006">Indeed, it emphasized the finding by stating that Oklahoma's advertising ban would place cable TV operators in a particularly difficult position.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.622" offset="389832">The crux of this case is the crushing economic burden, the technical infeasibility and the illegality under federal law to delete advertising from a multitude of program signals that--</text>

            <text syncTime="95.295" offset="528595">Contrary to broadcasters, cable TV operators pick up signals as they find them over the air or over satellite, and they receive no notice of advertising.</text>

            <text syncTime="230.647" offset="1069956">We are dealing here in terms of seconds, not in terms of minutes, and unless they have full notice as to what is in the advertising, when it is going to come precisely, then they will have to wait a number of seconds before they even know what is in the advertising, and they would have to delete it manually.</text>

            <text syncTime="280.646" offset="1269950">I wish to emphasize here that many of the TV signals picked up by cable television operators are so-called reluctant television stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.720" offset="1318224">There is no economic incentive for television stations to cooperate with cable TV operators, and indeed many of them have expressly stated they will not so cooperate.</text>

            <text syncTime="373.905" offset="1642978">Oklahoma until 1980 did not apply its advertising ban to cable TV operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.630" offset="1689894">In that year, abandoning a decade's practice, the Attorney General of Oklahoma held that the advertising ban would apply to cable TV operators.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.621" offset="1737855">The District Court found that by applying the advertising ban to cable TV, the state would not directly advance its interest in promoting temperance.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.928" offset="1783099">To the contrary, the District Court found that in light of the pervasive advertising in newspapers, magazines, and other media, and beer advertising that is pervasive throughout the state--</text>

            <text syncTime="427.371" offset="1856869">That all this incremental advertising on cable would do is inform Oklahomans of what they already knew from other sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.810" offset="1890619">The Court of Appeals did not overturn those findings, but in the face of them, deferred to the legislative judgment of Oklahoma, and upheld the advertising ban as it applies to cable TV.</text>
            <text syncTime="449.284" offset="1944536">It did so because it misinterpreted this Court's decisions under the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.123" offset="1971808">Oklahoma rests its entire case on the proposition that the Twenty-First Amendment empowers it not only to regulate or ban the importation, transportation of wine into the state of Oklahoma, but also to ban interstate advertising by someone who is not a liquor licensee, but who is engaged in the business of communication.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.441" offset="2085179">No decision of this Court has so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="488.142" offset="2099912">To the contrary, this Court's decisions have limited the scope of the Twenty-First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.729" offset="2122273">In the case of California Liquor Retail Dealers Association versus Midcal Aluminum, this Court held that even in the area of liquor commerce, the federal government retains a substantial interest, and in that case, the Court struck down a California retail pricing scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.262" offset="2216418">The Court said that the state's interest in that scheme was unsubstantiated and far outweighed by the federal government's interest in maintaining competition.</text>

            <text syncTime="546.598" offset="2333760">When we go beyond that area, as we certainly do here, because the impact of the state's regulation is upon people not engaged in liquor commerce, but people engaged in an entirely different element of commerce, then this Court's decisions in Craig versus Boren and in Larkin versus Grendel's Den, for example, say that the Twenty-First Amendment does not alter constitutional analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.300" offset="2448595">Here, there is a pervasive, a comprehensive federal scheme of regulation of cable television.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.341" offset="2492689">Its purpose is to ensure that cable television becomes an integral part of a national communications network.</text>

            <text syncTime="620.646" offset="2629989">The reason the trial court judge decided the summary judgment motion on First Amendment grounds as opposed to preemption grounds, I believe, was because he asked the parties to brief and argue those elements in the case that were common to both the broadcasters and the cable TV operators, and that meant he wanted briefing of the First Amendment issue, because by that time the broadcasters were with us.</text>

            <text syncTime="1019.156" offset="4223981">Here, we are dealing, as this Court stated in Metromedia, with the law of cable television, and there are very special considerations that apply because of the effect this ban has not only on the commercial speech but on the non-commercial programming carried by cable TV operators.</text>

            <text syncTime="1071.124" offset="4431811">There are also situations that would, of course, be illegal under federal law, and under those circumstances there could be a federal ban upon the advertising that may be able to pass the Central Hudson test and may not in fact restrain non-commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.287" offset="4516552">This is a situation, however, in which not only does the advertising ban restrain non-commercial speech because of the economics and technology of cable television, but it also is an advertising ban that does not pass the tests established by this Court in Central Hudson.</text>

            <text syncTime="1347.882" offset="5538880">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the Federal Communcations Commission has regulated the cable television industry since the mid-1960's.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.544" offset="5613591">The consistent themes of that regulation have been to encourage the widest availability and diversity of programming to persons all across the nation while ensuring that the position of broadcasters, who are, after all, the originators of most programming, are not undercut by the availability of the new medium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.524" offset="5693421">The Commission's regulatory approach in this area has been dictated in large part by factors inherent to the cable industry, the economic role of cable operators in relation to broadcasters, and the technological structure of the cable systems, a matter which Mr. Rushforth discussed in his argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.538" offset="5777535">Oklahoma's law at issue here is preempted by federal regulation because it requires cable operators to do something that the Commission has determined as an economic matter they should not be permitted to do, and that as a technological matter they cannot feasibly do, namely, to delete certain advertisements from the programming to which those advertisements were attached by the program originators.</text>

            <text syncTime="1514.723" offset="6206257">--The reasons are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.223" offset="6212213">One has to do with the economics of the cable industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.108" offset="6227782">The other has to do with the technological structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1522.477" offset="6237290">The economics drive from the fact that cable operators receive their revenues from subscriber fees, from the homes that bring in the cable networks to their television sets.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.035" offset="6287550">They receive no income from the advertising that they carry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.838" offset="6306672">This is in marked contrast to the broadcasters, who receive no fees from the persons who own the television sets, but who receive their revenues from the advertisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.444" offset="6345124">In addition, the cable operators have no contractual relationship with the broadcast stations from which they obtain their programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.816" offset="6382636">That is to say, they have no contract with the station, they pay no money to the stations, and they have no control over the content of the programming that the stations broadcast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.643" offset="6433940">Cable operators and broadcasters are able to proceed in this fashion because there is a certain conjunction of interests that the cable operators obtain free programming, which makes their services more valuable to the subscribers, but at the same time nationwide broadcasters and cable networks expand their audience, thus enabling them to command a higher price for their advertising, but this conjunction of interests exists only so long as the cable operators are required to carry the advertising along with the programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.833" offset="6578658">If cable operators such as those in Oklahoma are enabled to delete the advertising, they become free riders.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.839" offset="6610737">They divert the listenership from the broadcasters while contributing nothing to the advertising pool which provides the financing to support the programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1627.479" offset="6657235">This economic structure is one that Congress studied and expressly adopted when it amended the Copyright Act of 1976.</text>

            <text syncTime="1636.335" offset="6692657">Well, Mr. McConnell, the FCC doesn't protect broadcasters in the Oklahoma situation, does it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.608" offset="6725780">They can be required so far as the FCC is concerned not to carry liquor advertising in Oklahoma?</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.445" offset="6757127">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.961" offset="6763187">The reasons for that are that the local broadcaster is the very person who would receive the revenues from the advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.484" offset="6797251">There is no third party whose copyright interests would be infringed by the broadcaster not being permitted to carry the advertising.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.323" offset="6836644">Moreover, the broadcaster as a technological matter simply broadcasts one signal over which he has complete control, whereas the cable operators are broadcasting a number of signals, usually somewhere between 12 and 30 signals simultaneously, and their operations are simply not equipped even to know what the content of the advertising is, much less to be able to delete it if they did know.</text>

            <text syncTime="1700.942" offset="6951165">Mr. McConnell, in making the preemption analysis, do you think that the Court has to do the Midcal type of balancing because of the Twenty-First Amendment?</text>

            <text syncTime="1717.637" offset="7017934">I don't believe that the Court needs to engage in balancing, because the Twenty-First Amendment gives states enhanced authority over the sale and importation of alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1729.945" offset="7067148">The regulation here does not apply to persons engaged in the sale or importation of alcoholic beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1736.282" offset="7092539">It applies to persons who are engaged in the cable industry, and the regulation concerns what types of programming signals they are able to import into the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1746.538" offset="7133499">Merely because that may have an impact upon the level of drinking or drunk driving in a state does not mean that the state is able to have enhanced power vis-a-vis the Congress over an unrelated industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1761.297" offset="7192536">This is a structure which was explicitly adopted by Congress as well as the Commission when it determined that it would... when Congress set up the compulsory licensing scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1773.474" offset="7241228">Congress considered various ways in which the cable operations might be able to solve the copyright problem, and concluded that a system of individual contracts with various broadcasters was simply infeasible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1787.215" offset="7296190">Thus the broadcasters pay a set fee into a royalty pool which is then divided among broadcasters, and in exchange for that, they are able to pick up programming from broadcasters all over the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.291" offset="7352510">The most important quid pro quo for being able to pick up this broadcasting, however, is that they carry the commercials along with the programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.313" offset="7392634">This is the main way in which broadcasters are remunerated for the broadcasting that they carry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1817.384" offset="7416876">The principal focus of this case has been on broadcasters, but I would just like to add very quickly that there is the matter of cablecasters as well, as to which the non-deletion requirements of the statute and regulations not directly apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="1836.230" offset="7492317">However, the Commission has expressly preempted the all state and local control over the content of signal carriage, and the effect of that has been to protect the contractual arrangements for non-deletion which are the uniform policy within the industry from being violated by state and local requirements of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1857.294" offset="7576536">Precisely the same economic and technological factors that make the non-deletion requirements in the broadcast area so compelling also apply in the area of cablecast.</text>
            <text syncTime="1868.936" offset="7623138">The Commission has recognized this quite explicitly all the way since before cablecast was actually a practical reality--</text>

            <text syncTime="2139.958" offset="8707220">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, the issue before the Court today is whether the state of Oklahoma may prohibit the advertising of liquor in Oklahoma by the television medium coming into the homes of the citizens of the state of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.391" offset="8804918">The petitioners contend that there are two impediments to that, and they rely upon the First Amendment, a First Amendment ground and a preemption ground.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.798" offset="8850580">First, let's talk about the regulatory scheme and the historical basis for the rule itself in the state of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="2184.887" offset="8886943">Oklahoma's prohibition of liquor advertisement is part of a state constitutional amendment which repealed Prohibition in 1959.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.112" offset="8927798">One of the conditions of that repealing was that they retain the prohibition against liquor advertisement.</text>

            <text syncTime="3510.716" offset="14190218">You are going to have possibly, and it was raised by one of the questions when petitioners were presenting their argument, and that is, what about an unlawful activity being advertised by the cablecaster?</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.257" offset="14244343">That would not have commercial speech protection, because it would be concerning unlawful activity, and it would not meet the Central Hudson test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.314" offset="14284572">Well, they are saying that the state of Oklahoma has no authority to or any control because it is preempted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.337" offset="14316755">It would be up to the federal... or the FCC to enforce the type of violations of state law where it would be an unlawful activity and they would be advertising it within the state of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.312" offset="14372657">We must also address the problem of the electronic media, and that is the children in the state of Oklahoma, because cable television is getting very pervasive in the state of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3572.356" offset="14436814">It is getting very popular.</text>
            <text syncTime="3573.489" offset="14441307">It is getting into the homes, and that is one of the reasons that there were many complaints that came in that resulted in the request of an AG's opinion to determine whether cablecasting or cable television fell under the prohibition of liquor advertising, and the opinion was rendered, because of the coming into homes, and it had not been coming into the homes before, and people were getting rather excited about the uninvited solicitation to... for the artificial stimulation to consume alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="3607.946" offset="14579129">In conclusion, the petitioners' challenges to Oklahoma's restriction on liquor advertising is not supported by sound constitutional arguments, nor is petitioners' position supported by sound public policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.122" offset="14635867">If this Court were to adopt petitioners' position, it would leave states powerless to protect a citizen against liquor advertising, no matter how fraudulent, no matter how deceptive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3633.644" offset="14681947">Under the petitioners' arguments, the federal government, despite the Twenty-First Amendment, has absolute power to dictate that the children of Oklahoma be subjected to television advertising of alcohol that is aimed specifically at encouraging the consumption and indeed increased consumption of alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.943" offset="14771181">In proposing the Twenty-First Amendment to the people of this country, Congress itself refused to include provisions which would have vested Congress with concurrent power to regulate or prohibit the sale of intoxicating beverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3669.353" offset="14824784">The record as far as the debate when the Twenty-First Amendment was presented to Congress, Senator Wagner, one of his statements in that third section that gave the federal government concurrent power, he said, what we are doing here, we are expelling the federal government out of the liquor business as far as regulating it, and we are supposed to be giving the states express power, and then we're letting them in the back door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.801" offset="14926557">That is one of the things that we think is the spirit of the Twenty-First Amendment, and that was to give the states the power to regulate the alcohol and the effects of alcohol and the incidence of alcohol in the state of Oklahoma, and that is exactly what we feel like the Twenty-First Amendment was all about, and to prevent a situation such as we have here, and that is the federal government coming in and telling the people of Oklahoma that they don't have the right to regulate alcohol or the incidence of alcohol.</text>
