            <label>Mr. Charles Hieken</label>
            <text syncTime="52.008" offset="351319">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="56.631" offset="369813">This case presents the question whether when constitutional rights are involved appellate judges who did not hear the witnesses testify can conduct a de novo review of the cold printed record of a lengthy bench trial unrestrained by the clearly erroneous requirements of Rule 52(a) or the due process requirements of the Fifth Amendment and reverse the findings of the U.S. District Court judge who heard the witnesses testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.824" offset="510666">In 1967 Dr. Amar G. Bose, a professor of electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, invented the 901 loudspeaker system.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.854" offset="578793">The design of the 901 loudspeaker system was based on 12 years of research at MIT.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.070" offset="611603">In 1968 Bose began marketing the loudspeaker and the 901 loudspeaker met with success in the market place.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.827" offset="654653">The District Court had found that the Bose 901 had received the best reviews which had been given to a loudspeaker product.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.984" offset="699270">Then in 1970 Respondent Consumers Union published an article entitled 24 medium priced loudspeakers based on tests and measurements conducted in its laboratories by its engineers including the use of panelists.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.166" offset="831972">The article also reported on tests conducted of some higher priced loudspeakers under the heading "Some Loudspeakers of Special Interest".</text>
            <text syncTime="184.315" offset="880560">One of these loudspeakers of special interest was the Bose 901 loudspeaker system.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.070" offset="907622">The District Court found that the article as a whole disparaged the 901 loudspeaker system.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.052" offset="935521">In particular the District Court found that one statement was actionable in that it was false and disparaging.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.200" offset="984109">Based on observations of panelists playing recordings through the Bose 901 loudspeaker system, the article reported</text>
            <text syncTime="221.518" offset="1029353">"worse individual instruments heard through the Bose system tended to wonder about the room. "</text>
            <text syncTime="229.064" offset="1059551">The District Court judge then determined that Bose was a public figure and would be required to meet the actual malice test of New York Times and, therefore, had to prove that CU knew of the falsity of the statement by clear and convincing evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.627" offset="1145859">What the District Court judge did was to focus on the knowledge of the author of the statement, A. L. Seligson who was the engineer in charge of conducting the tests and who actually wrote the article.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.390" offset="1212942">He was one of the two panelists who participated in the test upon which the false statement was based.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.974" offset="1247214">Well, when the article came out Bose complained promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="282.128" offset="1271874">They tried to set up a meeting as soon as possible with CU.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.960" offset="1291204">Finally in June of 1970 the meeting was held and Dr. Bose went to this meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.607" offset="1321715">He told the people there, look, it is scientifically impossible for a loudspeaker system to make instruments wonder about the room when heard through a loudspeaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.633" offset="1369885">So he asked for a demonstration there.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.748" offset="1390365">They had the loudspeakers there.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.530" offset="1401441">It would have taken a half hour to set up the demonstration according to the testimony of Seligson who was at the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.554" offset="1433520">But its association technical director, Monte Florman, refused to put on the demonstration.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.549" offset="1465493">Dr. Bose again asked for the demonstration, and again the demonstration was refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.424" offset="1493079">So Dr. Bose asked Mr. Seligson to please identify the recordings that had been used to observe the strange phenomena of instruments wondering about the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.574" offset="1549608">Seligson said that he would supply those recordings but he never did and, therefore, as the District Court found at the conclusion of the damage trial Bose could not refute the false statement by demonstrating to customers and dealers that in fact instruments heard through the Bose system did not wander about the room when using the same recordings that Consumers Union had allegedly used during the test.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.244" offset="1680324">Well, Bose sought a retraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.617" offset="1693804">It was refused so Bose sued in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.580" offset="1713657">Finally in 1980 there was a trial on the liability question first.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.045" offset="1743541">Low and behold at the trial we now learn why CU refused to demonstrate the loudspeakers or to identify the recordings.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.445" offset="1801115">The reason, because at the trial it came out the panelists never heard instruments through the Bose system that tended to wander about the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.822" offset="1846672">Now the false and disparaging statement was based on a special listening test conducted in the special listening room that Consumers Union had.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.061" offset="1899544">It was a room about 18 feet wide and about 24 feet long.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.955" offset="1927129">At one end of the room--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="449.767" stopTime="460.443">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="449.767" offset="1942385">As to the disparaging nature of the language which you just referred to both the District Court and the Court of Appeals ruled in your client's favor on that point.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_hieken" startTime="460.443" stopTime="493.375">
            <label>Mr. Charles Hieken</label>
            <text syncTime="460.443" offset="1985121">That is correct, Your Honor, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.358" offset="1996720">They had set these loudspeakers at the end of the room about 10 feet apart and supposedly they played recordings through them.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.843" offset="2046666">At the trial... By the way, you probably know what stereo sound is that you have a speaker at the left and a speaker at the right just as in this courtroom to the left of the bench there is a column of three speakers and similarly to the right.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="493.375" stopTime="496.317">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="493.375" offset="2116883">You don't sound like you are on stereo.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.336" offset="2124720">[Laughter]</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="charles_hieken" startTime="496.317" stopTime="971.780">
            <label>Mr. Charles Hieken</label>
            <text syncTime="496.317" offset="2128586">That is probably because we are sending the signals and faced both channels simultaneously so you get mono, right.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.834" offset="2166620">Put in stereo... You are exactly right though because now you are observing what happens when both left and right loudspeakers receive sound energy of the same intensity.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.982" offset="2215312">The sound appears to come from the middle.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.943" offset="2223149">Now if you were to turn down the loudspeaker at your left you would hear the sound coming from the right, and if you turned down the intensity of the sound at the right you would hear the sound coming from the left.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.154" offset="2279991">That is just what happens in a stereo system.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.194" offset="2292112">Gradually they raised the level of the left and then in the right and the net impact on you is that you hear instruments that come from various points between the two loudspeakers and that is normal stereo sound.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.365" offset="2356791">You can try it at home on your own stereo system by taking your balance control and moving it to the left and then to the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.869" offset="2386780">You will get the same effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.241" offset="2392318">That is basically what Seligson and Lefkow testified they heard at the special listening test.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.427" offset="2428994">Now they said that they observed movement on only one instrument.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.382" offset="2460863">That one instrument was the violin sounds, and they said that the movement was restricted to movement between the left and the right loudspeaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.139" offset="2503913">It did not wander about the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="593.711" offset="2518228">Now during cross examination Seligson and Lefkow each drew on large charts exactly what they heard during the special listening test and reproductions of those drawings are included in Petitioner's brief after page 12.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.889" offset="2618852">One of them is Plaintiff's Exhibit 29.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.701" offset="2630137">That was the drawing that Seligson made.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.622" offset="2641840">The loudspeakers are represented as small pentagons at one end of the wall, and they look much like home plate in a baseball game.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.219" offset="2692204">Seligson drew a red line between the loudspeakers with arrowheads at each end and the various violin sounds came from various points on that line between the loudspeakers and from nowhere else.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.323" offset="2776631">Lefkow drew something somewhat similar on Plaintiff's Exhibit 35 which is a small red rectangle between the left and right loudspeakers, and the sounds came from that region and nowhere else and only on the violin.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.377" offset="2852804">The piano sounds did not wander they testify.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.519" offset="2873389">Well, on cross examination after that drawing was completed Seligson was asked why did you use the words</text>
            <text syncTime="696.838" offset="2930649">"tended to wander about the room. "</text>
            <text syncTime="699.610" offset="2941725">to describe what you had drawn on the board?</text>
            <text syncTime="702.182" offset="2952070">Seligson replied, "Well", about</text>
            <text syncTime="707.016" offset="2971400">"meant to me mean about the rear wall between the speakers. "</text>
            <text syncTime="713.221" offset="2996164">What happened, the District Court made specific findings.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.202" offset="3024168">They said,</text>
            <text syncTime="720.793" offset="3026466">"Look. "</text>
            <text syncTime="721.624" offset="3029810">"People would not be surprised to find movement along the wall between the two speakers. "</text>
            <text syncTime="728.410" offset="3056977">"That is normal stereo sound basically. "</text>
            <text syncTime="730.563" offset="3065546">Movement throughout the other areas of the room was not to be expected.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.057" offset="3095534">Such a bizarre effect is contrary to what listeners are accustomed to and would be objectionable to most listeners.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.315" offset="3144644">The District Court, of course, heard Seligson testify on six trial days and he found that Seligson's testimony on "about the room" meaning along the wall between speakers not credible based on his demeanor and Seligson's testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.354" offset="3252791">In addition, the District Court found that the testimony of CU's technical director who at the time of the tests was associate technical director was wholly untrustworthy and not credible.</text>
            <text syncTime="798.167" offset="3335965">At the conclusion of the damage trial there was an appeal and the Court of Appeals as Mr. Justice Rehnquist noticed found the statement disparaging and assumed it was false, but then the Court of Appeals went on and said now what we must do is we just perform a de novo review of the record not limited by the clearly erroneous requirements of Rule 52(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="833.910" offset="3479012">Now in the course of this review the Court of Appeals did not mention under the heading "review" the state of mind of the author Seligson but instead it focused on the editorial review and in connection with this editorial review it relied on the testimony of Monte Florman, the associate technical director whose testimony was found by the District Court to be wholly untrustworthy and not credible.</text>
            <text syncTime="865.731" offset="3606280">In making reference to wall maybe he was only guilty of using imprecise language it appeared to be relying on the testimony of Seligson to the effect, well, what did you want me to say instead of wandered about the room?</text>
            <text syncTime="883.973" offset="3679214">Would you be happier if I had said across the wall?</text>
            <text syncTime="887.046" offset="3691544">I think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.586" offset="3697709">What the Court of Appeals also did is it said it is not enough for Bose to prove actual malice according to the New York Times test, but Bose had to prove evidence of actual malice by showing evidence of negligence, motive and intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.232" offset="3788302">The Court of Appeals said, well, we are just unable to find clear and convincing proof that Consumers Union knew that the false and disparaging statement that it published was false.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.563" offset="3865624">Well, there are a number of errors in the way the Court of Appeals conducted is review.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.978" offset="3899270">First of all, it made a de novo review of the record to determine if the evidence was clear and convincing to it, not whether it could have been clear and convincing to the United States District Court judge who tried the case, who actually heard the witnesses testify, who was able to observe their demeanor, who when he was troubled on a point was able to question the witness and clarify that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2069.749" offset="8422320">Within a year or so after publication of the article the Bose 901 according to the record was either first or second in total dollar volume sales in the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.207" offset="8472161">Thus, if Consumers Union may have a great effect it certainly was not a negative effect in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.623" offset="8505807">Indeed, the review was in part complimentary and in part cautionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2097.528" offset="8533392">It attempted to put into words the author's aesthetic perception of a uniquely subjective impression of an amorphus phenomenon that all parties including the Court had difficulty in describing with precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.399" offset="8592951">As noted the Review's evaluation opened with praise of the plaintiff's product.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.572" offset="8617611">It termed the Bose 901 considerably more spacious and reverberant than conventional speakers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2124.967" offset="8643211">It said that the effect was rather dramatic and was felt from any listening position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.741" offset="8666303">After judging various qualities of the Bose system indeed the article concluded not by recommending against purchase of the Bose but by directly telling its readers we think the Bose system is so unusual that a prospective buyer must listen to it and judge it for himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2151.204" offset="8748119">The article in addition to the concededly complimentary findings and the encouragement to try the product noted that it was more difficult to pinpoint the location of the instruments with the Bose than with standard speaker systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2167.346" offset="8812693">That is a finding that was not found false in the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2172.457" offset="8833173">In specifying what it meant about the localization problems the Review went on to say in a single sentence containing the only phrase found actionable by the District Court</text>
            <text syncTime="2185.326" offset="8884687">"worse individual instruments heard through the Bose systems seem to grow to gigantic proportions and tended to wander about the room. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.013" offset="8931394">The immediately following sentence the author put both size and location of the described receptions into context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.960" offset="8975175">It was written,</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.172" offset="8979982">"For instance a violin appeared to be 10 feet wide and a piano stretched from wall to wall. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.398" offset="9008925">Then the author minimized his judgments by stating</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.112" offset="9039750">"With orchestral music such effects seem inconsequential, but we think they might become annoying when listening to soloists. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.691" offset="9078097">The District Court found defamation, disparagement only by breaking the sentence in two, by parsing it artificially.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.017" offset="9127417">That portion of the sentence which referred to</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.007" offset="9135358">"instruments seeming to grow to gigantic proportions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.722" offset="9154271">was held not proven false.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.993" offset="9163257">The Court then isolated and wrenched from its context the remainder of the phrase that</text>
            <text syncTime="2262.667" offset="9193977">"instruments tended to wander about the room. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2265.672" offset="9205993">As noted the judge found that subjective perception was better expressed as such which tended to wander about or along the wall rather than about the room.</text>
            <text syncTime="2280.134" offset="9263880">It ignored the word "tended" in the disputed phrase itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2285.237" offset="9284256">The District Court dismissed the following sentence which placed the effects along the wall by saying that sentence would not thus be understood by any reasonable reader, and the phrase was found by the District Court to attribute bizarre and grotesque effects to the product despite the plain absence of any such words in the article and the plain language in the article that the effects were inconsequential with orchestral music and only might become annoying when listening to soloists.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.411" offset="9428974">Having found the disputed phrase to be false the court disregarded the author's testimony to his good faith belief that the words accurately described what he had just seen.</text>

            <text syncTime="3211.164" offset="12988001">As this Court has stated in Pullman-Standard v. Swint if the District Court's findings rest on erroneous view of law they may be set aside on that basis and are not subject to the restrictions of Rule 52.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.897" offset="13054875">The record is again clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="3231.119" offset="13067831">The District Court opinion is plain that the only reason for finding actual malice, the only reason articulated by the District judge was that the author was too intelligent to have made an honest mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.686" offset="13122062">There was nothing else in the record, nothing else relied upon by the District Court for its finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3250.951" offset="13147139">It was that and that alone.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.482" offset="13157275">We believe that in doing so the District Court committed plain legal error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.556" offset="13181516">It inferred malice from falsity and applied an objective reasonable person standard which has been forbidden by this Court specifically in Garrison v. Louisiana where the lower court, the state court, there had found actual malice because it said it is inconceivable to me that the defendant could have had a reasonable belief which could be defined as an honest belief that not one but all eight of these judges were guilty of what he charged them with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3291.046" offset="13307531">This Court rejected that analysis stating that this is not a holding applying the New York Times test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.222" offset="13336266">The reasonable belief standard applied by a trial judge is not the same as the wreckless disregard of truth standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.977" offset="13367195">The District Court's holding if allowed to stand would in fact turn New York Times on its head.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.593" offset="13397706">It would effectively impose strict liability upon responsible conscientious publishers such as Consumers Union with hardworking, caring, intelligent writers and editors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3326.380" offset="13448801">It would render their carefully constructed editorial procedures designed to achieve accuracy irrelevant and meaningless.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.175" offset="13484014">Indeed, by virtue of those very procedures by virtue of the high standards of journalism which they embody they would be ruled incapable of making an honest mistake and given no breathing space for honest error.</text>
            <text syncTime="3349.825" offset="13542633">Their words would be placed in the same legal category as which are placed the use of explosives, the harboring of dangerous animals and forms of product liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.523" offset="13585474">A system of freed of expression will surely not tolerate such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.646" offset="13613895">The Court of Appeals recognized this erroneous misapplication of the law and faulted the District Court for its holding that to find actual malice in this case would be to interpret that concept to require little more than proof of falsity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.629" offset="13693830">We believe that that holding is eminently correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="3428.948" offset="13859133">It did not engage in de novo fact finding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3432.378" offset="13872821">Its role was limited solely to independently weighing the facts and determining whether as applied to the Constitution they met the clear and convincing proof standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.390" offset="13928932">It seems to us that nothing could be more appropriate for a federal appellate court or this Court to determine on undisputed facts what the Constitution means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.996" offset="13979296">We believe that even more so than the issue of fraud in the denaturalization proceedings before Justice Frankfurter in the Baumgartner case that actual malice is a finding which cannot escape broadly social judgments which is inextricably enmeshed with important fundamental rights, and as in Baumgartner the burden of proof placed upon a plaintiff is to establish its case with convincing clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.728" offset="14110222">This constitutional requirement would be forfeit if a Court of Appeals could not exercise independent judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.905" offset="14142927">The net result would become that in First Amendment cases in public figure defamation cases for all practical purposes the District Courts finding on both factual and legal components would become impervious to review.</text>

            <text syncTime="3525.351" offset="14244700">As pointed out there the function of the legal process is to minimize the risk of an erroneous decision by requiring proof of more than a mere preponderance by calling upon a public figure libel plaintiff to establish actual malice with convincing clarity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.831" offset="14314708">The First Amendment has allocated the risk of error between the litigants.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles Hieken</label>
            <text syncTime="3560.213" offset="14384194">If, Your Honor, please.</text>
            <text syncTime="3562.965" offset="14395165">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3565.506" offset="14405405">I would like to answer your question, Mr. Justice Blackmun, about the Baumgartner case which basically deals with an ultimate finding of fact there which is really a conclusion of law or a mixed question of law and fact and, of course, the Court can always look at the evidence to see if there is enough evidence to be clear and convincing to the trier of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.990" offset="14499342">That is a question of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.033" offset="14511462">Whether the trial court found it to be clear and convincing is a question of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.037" offset="14535495">In the Woodby case at 385 U.S. 276 on page 367 this Court pointed out there is an elementary but crucial difference between burden of proof and scope of review and that is, of course, commonplace in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3617.390" offset="14612922">It said the difference is most graphically illustrated in a criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3623.154" offset="14635910">There the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, but if the correct burden of proof was imposed at the trial judicial review is generally limited to ascertaining whether the evidence relied upon by the trier of fact was of sufficient quality and substantiality to support the rationality of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.170" offset="14727965">In other words, an appellate court in a criminal case ordinarily does not ask itself whether it believes that the evidence at the trial established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt but whether the judgment is supported by substantial evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3660.528" offset="14785435">We submit that the same type of review is appropriate here to determine whether the trial court could find by clear and convincing evidence that the statement was actually false.</text>
            <text syncTime="3672.096" offset="14831724">We do not agree with the characterization of the record by the Respondent here, but I believe that we have adequately covered it in our reply brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.924" offset="14874982">I would like really to kind of conclude here with what I feel is a very important aspect of this case, the proper allocation of business in the courts, the trial courts into appellate courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3695.540" offset="14925451">The trial courts' primary function is the finding of facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.663" offset="14946035">The appellate courts' primary function is rulings of law to check what the trial court did to make sure that rulings of law have been followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3711.131" offset="14987831">If appellate courts are going to independently reexamine facts then an attorney who has lost a case has no alternative but to go up to the Court of Appeals and hope that he is going to get a new trial on the facts in the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="3727.381" offset="15052824">We submit that that is inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3730.623" offset="15065781">It is not conducive to justice and would result in more appeals and less justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3738.029" offset="15095456">Accordingly, we submit that the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed here, the judgment of liability of the trial court affirmed and the Court of Appeals instructed to review the question of damages in accordance with the clearly erroneous rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3753.470" offset="15157209">Thank you.</text>
