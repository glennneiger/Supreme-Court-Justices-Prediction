            <label>Mr. Daniel H. Pollitt</label>
            <text syncTime="9.767" offset="180412">Mr. Chief Justice, thank you, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.289" offset="186577">May it please the Court, this case involves the appointment of white males only as forepersons of federal grand juries in the Eastern District of North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.427" offset="235060">The appointments were made by Article III federal district court judges.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.729" offset="252301">The discrimination continued unabated for 15 consecutive grand juries, from 1974 through 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="38.856" offset="296813">There were 15 forepersons selected by the judges, all white males, no blacks, and no women.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.302" offset="326593">The testimony also shows that the odds of this happening by chance are 1 in 10,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.277" offset="358462">The government does not deny this pattern of discrimination in favor of white males against blacks and women, nor does the government deny that this discrimination is wrong, that it is unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.378" offset="422933">In response to our petition for certiorari, the government said that it would take steps to have the U.S. Attorneys call the attention of the courts to the importance of nondiscriminatory foreperson selection procedures.</text>

            <text syncTime="86.507" offset="487403">Would you agree, Mr. Pollitt, that the... a key question, if not the key question in this case is, assuming the truth of all that, which we accept because it's agreed to, its impact on this particular case is the Gorton thing, isn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="107.180" offset="570054">Sir, it was below.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.023" offset="577473">But I think that it is no longer the important thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.624" offset="587922">I would like to focus on the judges who made these appointments, rather than on the forepersons who exercised the various powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.590" offset="623762">We do think that this is much like Rose v. Mitchell in regard to the powers exercised by the forepersons of the federal grand juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.297" offset="662528">But what we urge here is the exercise of the supervisory power of this Court over the lower federal judges, and we think that is the critical issue, if Your Chief Justice please.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.425" offset="711115">And I would like to address that, if I may.</text>

            <text syncTime="170.395" offset="822919">I will argue them only in the context... for example, the Rose v. Mitchell and the equal protection cases under the Fourteenth Amendment, and what I refer to myself as the Heard v. Hodges situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.124" offset="881852">Herd was a restrictive covenant case out of the District of Columbia.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.437" offset="903168">The companion case was Shelley v. Kramer.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.840" offset="916751">In Shelley, this Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment equal protection clause precluded the state court judges from executing and enforcing the restrictive covenants.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.277" offset="966488">Then came Heard, which was the District of Columbia judges, and this Court under its supervisory power held that if it was unconstitutional for the state court judges to do it under the equal protection clause, the exercise of this Court's supervisory power was called for to stop the federal judges from doing the very same thing.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="229.092" offset="1057708">Mr. Pollitt, was that really what you'd call an exercise of the supervisory power?</text>
            <text syncTime="233.504" offset="1075367">I had always thought that was more associated with the enforcement of criminal law.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.948" offset="1093130">I always thought Heard v. Hodge was saying that a federal court of equity should not enforce a covenant that the Fourteenth Amendment prohibited a state court from enforcing.</text>

            <text syncTime="251.417" offset="1147047">That's what the... Mr. Justice Rehnquist... that's what the Court did hold, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.309" offset="1162616">But I refer to it in the theory that the supervisory power, going back to McNabb, and most recently, what has to do with the administration of federal criminal justice for a twofold purpose, as this Court recently held, which is to deter illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.763" offset="1252477">And I don't think there's any question that discrimination in the appointment of persons to--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="282.498" offset="1271390">Well, are you going to explain why this petitioner has standing to require us to either decide the supervisory or the constitutional?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel H. Pollitt</label>

            <text syncTime="296.065" offset="1325620">Well, that's why I preferred to stay with the supervisory power, because there's no problem withstanding under the supervisory power, if Your Honor please.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.892" offset="1364908">The three cases of Glasser, Thiel, and Ballard were supervisory powers affecting, concerning the appointments to federal juries.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.938" offset="1401166">And in each of those, the persons who protested were not members of the class that was excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.391" offset="1426975">And as this Court said in Ballard, Mrs. Ballard and her son had standing to protest the exclusion of women because the injury is not limited to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.651" offset="1487997">There is injury to the jury system, to the law as an institution, to the community at large, to the democratic idea reflected in the processes of our Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.659" offset="1536062">So if we stick here with the supervisory power, we can eliminate all questions of standing, which is what I would--</text>

            <text syncTime="366.802" offset="1608578">What we argue here is that it is wrong, it is illegal for federal district judges to discriminate on the basis of race and gender, and that this Court has authority under its supervisory power to call a halt.</text>
            <text syncTime="383.571" offset="1675661">And we think that is so for five interrelated reasons, if Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.685" offset="1700111">And the first reason is the Rose v. Mitchell reason; that discrimination on the basis of race, as Mr. Justice Blackmum wrote for the Court, is odious in all respects, and is especially pernicious in the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.147" offset="1770015">And so that's what we have here in the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.952" offset="1789241">And our second interrelated reason for applying the supervisory power is that the federal judges had authority to make these appointments under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(c).</text>
            <text syncTime="425.840" offset="1844725">The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure are promulgated by this Court, so it is this Court which authorized the federal district judges to make these appointments, and we submit that the federal district courts are abusing the authority given by this Court when they discriminate on the basis of race and gender, and that this Court... it is doubly appropriate for this Court to stop the federal judges from exercising the power which this Court gave it.</text>

            <text syncTime="454.689" offset="1960186">Mr. Pollitt, do you think this Court, if it were to exercise supervisory power over the federal judges, would have several options of how to do that?</text>
            <text syncTime="467.618" offset="2011909">Does it necessarily involve setting aside a verdict?</text>

            <text syncTime="489.874" offset="2100830">--If Your Honor, please, if I may elaborate slightly in my argument here, this is the lack of prejudice type of theory which was advanced by Justice Jackson in Cassell v. Texas back in 1950, and repeated in Rose v. Mitchell by Mr. Justice Potter Stewart, with Mr. Justice Rehnquist agreeing with Mr. Stewart, but no one else has advanced it since 1880.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.224" offset="2234263">This goes back to Virginia v. Rives where the Court held that the appropriate remedy is to dismiss the indictment and then possibly start all over again.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.762" offset="2280448">There's a cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.485" offset="2295285">No gainsaying that there's a cost.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.615" offset="2303853">The cost is that you have to get a correct grand jury, take the case to the grand jury, and spend some money and some time to do it right.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.751" offset="2340425">Against that, if Your Honors please, we have the decision by Mr. Justice Blackmun in Rose.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.968" offset="2381280">The other value is to stop racial discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.530" offset="2399461">That goes to the heart of the Civil War Amendments, and this Court in Rose thought that was a... carried much greater weight than the administrative expense.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="575.397" offset="2442929">Mr. Pollitt, if we expressed what you're asking, in as clear terms as it would expressed in a rule adopted by the traditional procedure, do you think that the federal judges of this country would not follow that rule?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_h_pollitt" startTime="597.653" stopTime="807.370">
            <label>Mr. Daniel H. Pollitt</label>
            <text syncTime="597.653" offset="2531955">No, I don't think that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.423" offset="2539060">I think that the federal judges read this Court's opinions and would obey them and comply with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.007" offset="2561421">On the other hand, if I may augment a little bit more, Your Honor, Cassell v. Texas and Rose v. Mitchell were state cases, and Mr. Justice Stewart wrote in his dissent, in his concurring with the judgment opinion in Rose, that the states are not required to have a grand jury, and therefore fault with the grand jury might be a harmless error.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.265" offset="2670404">That's not true in the federal system.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.145" offset="2677927">The Fifth Amendment begins with a grand jury clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.259" offset="2694436">No person shall be held for capital or infamous offense except upon presentment or indictment by a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.554" offset="2723589">And I don't think that you can just have an end run around the Fifth Amendment, whereas you don't have that problem in the state cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.269" offset="2762459">And furthermore, finally, if I may, there's a statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.072" offset="2785656">There's a statute which outlines a procedure in this type of situation, and it requires that the motions be made in a timely fashion, that there be a hearing, and if the judge decides that there is a fault, then the statute says that the judge shall dismiss the indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.585" offset="2851693">So that is the public policy of this country as expressed by the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.509" offset="2875413">And so... I hope I didn't go too long, Justice O'Connor, to answer your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="689.814" offset="2900595">But I think there are a number of reasons why it's important to stick with the 100 year tradition which began in the Rives case.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.253" offset="2950436">I was outlining the various reasons why I think this Court should apply its supervisory power, and the first one is that the practice below is odious.</text>
            <text syncTime="720.733" offset="3024310">It pollutes the streams of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="725.886" offset="3044895">And the second is Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.728" offset="3056284">The authority comes under the... to make the appointment... stems from this Court through the Federal Rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.113" offset="3085855">And the third is the statutory reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.385" offset="3098916">The federal laws, Section 243, reconstruction law, says that it is a crime for anyone, federal or state, to discriminate on the basis of race or color in the appointment of jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.016" offset="3161401">And in Peters v. Kiff, Mr. Justice White, three members of the Court, held that a white defendant in the Georgia courts could protest the exclusion of blacks to augment and implement the public policy as expressed in 243.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.779" offset="3248546">And we suggest that 243 is still on the books; it has been augmented in 1968 by the Jury Service and Selection Act, and the policy of the United States, as expressed in these two federal laws, is that there not be any discrimination, and to implement, as Mr. Justice White thought appropriate in Peters v. Kiff, to implement that policy this Court should exercise its exclusionary power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1028.016" offset="4253424">Finally, Your Honors, I'd like to... the Fifth Amendment is another reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="1040.194" offset="4302116">The Fifth Amendment in the Constitution does require a grand jury, and the ACLU amicus brief points out that a grand jury is not just any collection of 16 to 23 individuals; that there is a content to the concept of grand jury, and at least since 1868 and the Fourteenth Amendment, that concept includes a body of persons from which no one is excluded because of their race or color.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.848" offset="4432728">And so for those reasons, we believe that this Court should find it, or hopefully will find it appropriate to exercise their supervisory power and to reverse the conviction, and then leave it up to the United States Attorney on whether or not he'll continue with this case by seeking a new indictment.</text>

            <text syncTime="1117.598" offset="4611824">But in the federal system, if we're talking about supervisory power, there at least is a different form of remedy that's available through the Judicial Councils of the circuits and the like.</text>

            <text syncTime="1194.027" offset="4917457">And again, I would say that the Constitution requires an indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.322" offset="4942639">No person shall be held to answer for any capital or infamous crime except upon presentment or indictment of a grand jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.029" offset="4973463">And it's essential to protect the integrity of the grand jury, and the way to do it is the tried and true method used for 100 years and rejected in Cassell when it was raised, rejected when it was raised again in Rose v. Mitchell, and I know that those were state cases and I think that adds to the strength here of using the supervisory power instead of going to the Constitution.</text>

            <label>Mr. Joshua I. Schwartz</label>
            <text syncTime="1436.200" offset="5886181">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the question in this case is whether a white male defendant is entitled to seek dismissal of the indictment returned against him by a validly-constituted federal grand jury by alleging that a pattern of discrimination against women and blacks in the selection of grand jury forepersons from among the members of the grand juries exists in the particular judicial district in which he was indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.227" offset="6002270">The issue before the Court pertains only to the remedies and rights available to a criminal defendant in the particular situation, for it is common ground among the parties that purposeful discrimination in foreperson selection is unlawful; it is prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment, or the Fifth Amendment in a federal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1486.812" offset="6088683">Any such discrimination violates the rights of grand jurors who suffer discrimination in connection with their opportunity to serve as foreperson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.619" offset="6131837">Our submission, however, is that the distinctive interests of criminal defendants that have been recognized by the Court in the jury selection cases on which petitioner relies simply are not implicated by the narrowly focused form of discrimination alleged in this particular setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.990" offset="6201323">The decision of the Court of Appeals which accords with those of the Third Circuit and the Ninth Circuit on this question, thus, is not as petitioner would have it, a radical departure from this Court's teaching in the jury selection cases; rather, we urge that consistent and careful application of the reasoning of this Court's decisions, beginning with Strauder v. West Virginia, running through Peters v. Kiff, and Taylor v. Louisiana, through Rose v. Mitchell, and Duren v. Missouri, leads to the conclusion that there is, in fact, no basis for the dismissal of petitioner's indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.475" offset="6343324">I'd like to turn, if I might, to the supervisory power argument, because it seems to have assumed the central presence in petitioner's argument, at least in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.102" offset="6389822">We do not agree that supervisory power, that reliance on supervisory power means the abandonment of all analysis of the effective interests of a criminal defendant, or of all standing requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1575.670" offset="6444053">It is true that in this Court's supervisory power decisions in jury selection, the Court recognized, before it did under constitutional grounds, that there are some interests of a criminal defendant beyond those of a black defendant not to be indicted by a grand jury from which the members of his race have been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.365" offset="6534854">But the Court's opinion, for instance, in Ballard v. United States, points to distinctive interests that are implicated, the interests of a defendant subsequently put on a constitutional foundation in the Sixth Amendment in having a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community, or by a process that does not rule out any significant segment of the community that is qualified to serve.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.503" offset="6635373">We, therefore, do not agree that you can simply discard all analysis or all consideration of the defendant's rights and the defendant's interest by placing the label "supervisory power" on the Court's decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.632" offset="6699948">Therefore, we are essentially obliged to turn to analysis of the interests of defendants which the Court has recognized under one theory or another in the different lines of cases which petitioner has invoked, to look at these cases and to see whether these interests of a criminal defendant are meaningfully or at all implicated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.175" offset="6778106">And we submit that they are not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.236" offset="6786361">But before I turn to that, I'd like to talk a minute about the petitioner's proposal, which is that the Court reverse his conviction, direct that his indictment be dismissed, and that the court start over... the lower court to be directed to start over and do it again, do it right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.249" offset="6858355">In this context, where we're talking only about the selection of the grand jury foreperson, that's a rather ambiguous prescription.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.713" offset="6892209">It appears, although I'm not certain about this, that starting over and doing it right, might result in another grand jury with a white male foreperson, in which case it is doubtful indeed what has been accomplished.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.974" offset="6953231">On the other hand, if the petitioner's proposal is that the case be remanded with instructions to appoint a black female foreperson, that would be quite a departure from any remedy previously provided by this Court, and it would be at odds with the Court's repeated holdings that no defendant has any right to a grand... to a petty jury of any particular description.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.387" offset="7034942">We think it clear that no defendant has any right to a particular grand jury foreperson of a particular race or sex.</text>
            <text syncTime="1730.272" offset="7062423">And for those reasons, we do think it is appropriate to look to the other kinds of remedies that might be available if the Court deems it appropriate as a supervisory authority.</text>

            <text syncTime="1857.315" offset="7570661">The Sixth Circuit's opinion in Mitchell v. Rose essentially took the point of view that you couldn't draw the line.</text>

            <text syncTime="1869.822" offset="7620712">And perhaps there is something to be said for the view that it's uncomfortable to draw a line to say what little segment of the grand jury could be improperly chosen.</text>

            <text syncTime="2028.197" offset="8254129">We'll start with equal protection, because that's where the petitioner started.</text>
            <text syncTime="2032.882" offset="8272937">The petitioner in his brief relied first on the line of cases starting with Strauder v. West Virginia, the 100-year-old tradition that petitioner invokes, that holds that a defendant may not be indicted or convicted by a jury from which members of his race have been excluded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.882" offset="8336885">The petitioner is a white male, and we don't believe he's well-situated to advance the particular claim of injury that we understand to be the basis for the equal protection jury selection cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.901" offset="8392996">Strauder tells us that the exclusion of blacks from a jury is a brand of inferiority upon that race which interferes with the opportunity for equal administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2074.839" offset="8440748">A white male simply does not suffer that brand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.702" offset="8460183">Wilbur Hobby cannot claim that he has been branded as inferior in this manner; in fact, the petitioner doesn't seem to claim that that was his injury, and he seems to acknowledge that he lacks standing to claim an equal protection violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2094.051" offset="8517548">But he does say that the equal protection cases set a tone which is relevant for this Court's consideration of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.047" offset="8545551">And in one respect, we can agree with that, because the analysis we advocate entails no retreat from this Court's traditional abhorrence for racial discrimination or for any other form of unlawful discrimination in jury selection or the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.838" offset="8616709">But it does... we do ask the Court to recognize that the right of criminal defendants to secure dismissal of their indictments from the equal protection cases has never rested sufficiently upon abhorrence for racial discrimination, but upon the critical element that some interest of the defendant is implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.061" offset="8693613">Absent that, we do not believe the equal protection analysis or the values that I'm informed can aid the petitioner here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2146.154" offset="8726005">There is another line of cases, to be sure, which dispenses with the so-called same class standing requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2155.042" offset="8761532">Petitioner has also invoked Justice Marshall's opinion in Peters v. Kiff and the fair cross-section doctrine established in the Sixth Amendment petty jury selection cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.089" offset="8805731">And we assume that, notwithstanding his race and sex, petitioner has standing to press such claims based on underrepresentation of women and blacks in the selection of a foreperson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.856" offset="8848781">Nevertheless, we do not believe that the authorities petitioner cites in this connection support his claim that his indictment should be dismissed if discrimination in foreperson selection were proven.</text>

            <text syncTime="3087.508" offset="12491399">So the 20 judges are in agreement that the foreperson is not a cipher or a clerk.</text>

            <text syncTime="3105.250" offset="12562348">I'd like to point out that slightly over 100 years ago, in Neal v. Delaware, this Court held that it was a violent presumption which could not be accepted that all members of the black race in Delaware were utterly disqualified to sit as jurors by want of intelligence, experience, and moral integrity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3130.677" offset="12664121">Today, if Your Honors please, it is still a violent presumption which cannot be accepted, that all blacks and women called for grand jury service in the Eastern District of North Carolina are utterly disqualified to hold the leadership positions by want of intelligence, experience, or moral integrity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.491" offset="12747399">Your Honors, this is a very important case or it would not be here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.513" offset="12763386">It involves racial discrimination in the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.347" offset="12782821">And I would like to close by reminding this Court that, from Rose v. Mitchell, discrimination on the basis of race, odicus in all aspects, is especially pernicious in the administration of justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3174.946" offset="12841127">And from Smith v. Texas, in the words of Mr. Justice Black,</text>
            <text syncTime="3179.679" offset="12860144">"Discrimination in the grand jury system is at war with our basic concepts of a democratic society and a representative government. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.996" offset="12897342">And that is what is at issue here today, if Your Honors please.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.408" offset="12911030">Now, the remedy we seek may be strong medicine, but unfortunately, the disease of racism is still rampant today in certain quarters, and we think that the remedy we call for is traditional and highly appropriate.</text>
