            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="143610">We'll hear arguments next in National Labor Relations board against City Disposal Systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.502" offset="157612">Mr. Come, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
            <text syncTime="5.836" offset="166911">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.089" offset="187914">This case, which is here on certiorari to the Sixth Circuit, involves the propriety of the Labor Board's conclusion that an individual employee's honest and reasonable assertion of a right that is provided for in a collective bargaining agreement, whose concerted activity was in the meaning of Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.767" offset="310585">The underlying facts briefly are as follows: Respondent hauls garbage for the City of Detroit from a drop-off point to a landfill some 37 miles away.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.608" offset="374010">The garbage is hauled by tractor trailers and normally a driver is assigned to a certain tractor trailer and when his vehicle is in for repairs he may be assigned to another one.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.127" offset="432106">Respondent is a party to a collective bargaining agreement with the local Teamsters Union covering its drivers.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.104" offset="475992">Section 1 of Article XXI of the Agreement provides that the employer shall not require employees to take out on the streets or highways any vehicle that is not in safe operating condition or equipped with the safety compliances prescribed by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.228" offset="560420">It further provides that it shall not be a violation of this Agreement where employees refuse to operate such equipment unless such refusal is unjustified.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.219" offset="616426">A further provision of the Agreement provides that the employer shall not ask or require any employee to take out equipment that has been reported by any other employee as being in unsafe operating condition unless the same has been approved as being safe by the mechanical department.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.183" offset="708273">James Brown was a driver for the Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.336" offset="736903">He normally drove Truck No. 245.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.311" offset="756756">On Saturday, May 12, 1979, he had a near accident with Truck No. 244 driven by another employee, Frank Hamilton, when the brakes on 244 would not stop the truck at a landfill.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.737" offset="850483">Hamilton took Truct 244 back to the drop-off point and with Brown present the mechanics told him that the truck would be fixed over the weekend or the first thing Monday morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.117" offset="912028">Brown returned to work at 4:00 a.m. on Monday, May 14th.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.813" offset="946823">He took out his Truck 245 to the landfill and found that the fifth wheel had a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.630" offset="990082">He returned to the drop-off point, talked to the mechanics and learned that the truck could not be fixed that day.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.686" offset="1026340">He then spoke to his supervisor, Jasmund, who told him to punch out and go home after confirming that Brown's truck could not be fixed.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.294" offset="1084750">Brown punched out, but remained in the driver's room, at which point Jasmund returned and requested Brown to drive Truck 244.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.222" offset="1132397">Brown said he would not do so since 244 had a brake problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.417" offset="1157266">Jasmund instructed Brown to go home and the two had a heated exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.476" offset="1217452">Another supervisor, Madary, came on the scene, and when Brown reported that 244 had problems, Madary replied that half the trucks around here have problems and if Respondent tried to deal with all of them it would be unable to do business.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.388" offset="1293102">During the conversation, Brown asked, Bob, what are you going to do, put the garbage ahead of the safety of the men?</text>
            <text syncTime="296.815" offset="1330823">Madary did not reply nor did he or Jasmund make any attempt to show Brown that Truck 244 had, in fact, been repaired and was safe.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.794" offset="1382754">Brown went home and later that day he was discharged.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.417" offset="1405220">The Union's Recording Secretary received notice of the discharge that day and he and Brown returned to the plant and sought to get Jasmund and Madary to put Brown back to work, but they refused to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.182" offset="1504276">The next day Brown filed a written grievance under the collective bargaining agreement alleging that he had been discharged in violation of the contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.333" offset="1560910">The Union declined to pursue Brown's grievance beyond the first step of the grievance procedure.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.529" offset="1901651">The Board, upholding the decision of its Administrative Law Judge, concluded that the Respondent had violated 8(a)(1) of the National Labor Relations Act by discharging Brown.</text>

            <text syncTime="470.378" offset="2025053">Why did the Administrative Law Judge think that Brown had been discharged?</text>

            <label>Mr. Norton J. Come</label>
            <text syncTime="482.765" offset="2074581">The Administrative Law Judge found that Brown had been discharged for asserting his contract rights not to drive an unsafe truck; that he had a good faith and a reasonable belief at least that the truck was unsafe and that under the Board's Interboro Doctrine the assertion of a reasonable and good faith contract claim is concerted activity protected by Section 7 of the Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="571.546" offset="2429742">There is an issue in this case which was not reached by the Sixth Circuit and would be open on remand; namely, whether or not Brown, in fact, was refusing to drive this truck because of good faith beliefs that it was unsafe or whether there were other reasons for his refusal.</text>

            <text syncTime="763.582" offset="3197847">Now, it does not follow, however, that every assertion of a right under a contract can be followed by a refusal to work if you are not granted your claim, because if there is a no-strike clause in the contract, the activity, though it may be concerted might forfeit the protection of Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.015" offset="3347581">Now, in this case, you do have a work refusal, however, the question of whether that would render the activity unprotected in our view is not presented in this case because Respondent did not raise that issue either before the Board or the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.928" offset="3479238">The only issue that he raised, apart from the factual one as to whether or not, in fact, it was safety that motivated him, was whether the activity was concerted where it involved merely the action of an employee acting alone.</text>

            <text syncTime="1079.739" offset="4462487">The only issue that was presented here is whether or not the fact that the employee acted alone in forcing a collectively bargained right made it not concerted activity.</text>

            <text syncTime="1890.710" offset="7706372">Now, against this factual background, both the Board and the Sixth Circuit found individual action by Brown and the Board seeks to utilize the fiction of constructive concerted activity under the Interboro Doctrine to bring an individual employee's refusal to perform assigned work within the scope of Section 7 and to activate the Board machinery to resolve a collective bargaining agreement dispute.</text>

            <text syncTime="2988.918" offset="12099228">That is our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.508" offset="12105602">Now, faced with the Act's plain meaning in the legislative history, the Board turns to a different argument and asserts that the Court should defer to its interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.515" offset="12145621">We would simply like to point out in this regard that in the Weingarten decision of this Court, the Court indicated that it should not step aside and rubber stamp the Board's determinations that run contrary to the language and the tenor of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.163" offset="12200165">Similarly, in the Edward DeBartolo Corporation decision earlier this spring, a decision interpreting Section 8(b)(4), the publicity proviso and the distribution requirements provided therein, this Court expressly did not allow the NLRB to apply so generous a standard as to strip the statutory restriction from the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.787" offset="12282712">If Congress had intended that broad a scope, they would not have placed the restriction in the Act in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3041.953" offset="12311342">We submit that the Board is doing precisely this thing with the Interboro Doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.575" offset="12329837">They are asking the Court to step aside and rubber stamp their determination and that determination is utilizing a standard so generous as to strip the concerted requirement from Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.633" offset="12386052">We would also like to point out that the policy underlying deference to the Board as was articulated in Weingarten was to allow the Board to construe the statute in light of changing patterns of industrial life, yet the most significant changing pattern here is the imergence of binding arbitration as a favored dispute resolution procedure, to utilize self-government in the work place through grievance arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.753" offset="12498588">The Interboro Doctrine flies in the face of this fundamental emerging pattern of industrial life and we submit for that reason it is not appropriate to afford the Board any deference in its determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3101.459" offset="12549370">Policy considerations, we would respectfully submit, also do not justify a departure from a plain-meaning interpretation of concerted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.317" offset="12596808">We submit that it is clear the Interboro Doctrine frustrates and does not serve fundamental national labor policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.752" offset="12622617">Addressing specific labor policies, the need for certainty is of critical importance in labor relations to maintain and promote industrial stability, particular in situations of employee discharges and potential work stoppages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.152" offset="12684162">Yet, the Interboro Doctrine kept all of the parties, including the employees, adrift on a sea of total uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.659" offset="12714150">It takes only a cursory review of the Board's Interboro decisions over the past few years to appreciate the magnitude of this uncertainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.482" offset="12749468">There are conflicting Board and arbitration decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3155.336" offset="12764932">We believe this is highlighted by the American Freight decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.678" offset="12778307">In American Freight, the Board found the employer committed an unfair labor practice by enforcing his contract right as affirmed by the arbitrator.</text>

            <text syncTime="3198.555" offset="12937759">When that case is analyzed against the Kohls decision in the D.C. Circuit and in the instant case, almost all of the critical facts are identical.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.694" offset="12986346">It is a truck safety issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.644" offset="12994183">The employee asserts he does not want to drive the truck.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.296" offset="13004737">There is no discussion or warning to any other employees, and, in fact, another employee in each one of these cases drove the truck that very same day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.222" offset="13044443">Yet the Board reached opposite legal conclusions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3229.577" offset="13061892">They found there was no concerted activity in Comet Fast Freight.</text>
            <text syncTime="3232.647" offset="13074118">This Comet Fast Freight decision would seem to invite inquiry by this Court of the Board's counsel whether the NLRB has recently changed its position on Interboro, whether the Board has stepped back from Interboro.</text>
            <text syncTime="3246.658" offset="13130229">We would submit either the Board has changed its position or its application of the doctrine is totally inconsistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3254.742" offset="13162516">Similarly, the Yellow Fast Freight Board decision which is another recent Board decision that is cited in the Board's reply brief is also hopelessly contradictory with earlier precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3267.560" offset="13213821">In that case, there was an individual employee's refusal to drive the truck and it was only a momentary refusal, engaging for some 15 to 20 minutes with his supervisor as to whether or not his driving a truck would violate the contract term relating to safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3283.800" offset="13278709">The Board concluded that that conduct constituted insubordination and, therefore, not protected against.</text>
            <text syncTime="3290.265" offset="13304622">That conduct is lesser conduct than in the instant case where the employee walks off the job and doesn't perform the work at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3298.230" offset="13336492">We would submit that another fundamental uncertainty arises from the Interboro Doctrine in that it denies all of the parties their agreed-upon, substantive, contract term.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.487" offset="13381527">It essentially makes mincemeat out of the contract because the Board is stepping in and applying, as in American Freight... It specifically indicates it is applying a lesser substantive safety standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.947" offset="13435339">We further submit with respect to uncertainty that there are inordinate delays that compound the uncertainty in this whole area where the Board intervenes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.574" offset="13473896">In collective bargaining agreements, there is often specific time frames provided for the grievance procedure and ultimately arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3341.701" offset="13510363">These often conclude within 30 to 60 or 90 days at the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="3346.481" offset="13529484">Using this case as an example, the Board decision was not reached until over two years after the incident occurred and with the appeals through the court there is even greater delay.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.090" offset="13583923">Turning to other policy considerations which we believe are of vital important, Interboro creates an entirely duplicative procedural structure for collective bargaining agreement dispute resolution with all of the attendant time, uncertainty and expense of duplication.</text>
