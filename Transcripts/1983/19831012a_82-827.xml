            <label>Mr. Robert H. Lynn</label>
            <text syncTime="68.455" offset="428713">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="71.597" offset="441252">The issue presented in this case is does the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution require suppression of incriminating admissions to a rape murder made by an out of custody probationer to his probation officer because that probation officer did not first warn the probationer of his right not to incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.642" offset="525471">The Minnesota Supreme Court in a divided opinion held solely as a matter of federal constitutional law that the Fifth Amendment required suppression of these admissions despite the fact that Respondent did not claim the privilege at the time the questions were asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.401" offset="592553">Instead, the Minnesota Supreme Court relied upon factors this Court has expressly rejected in at least three cases those being the Beckwith, Mathiason and Bayhiller cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.482" offset="640828">A state court may not impose greater restrictions as a matter of federal constitutional law where this Court specifically refrains from doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.406" offset="676563">An understanding of the legal issues in this case requires an understanding of the facts, and I would like to briefly summarize those for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.752" offset="705925">October 1974 a seventeen-year-old woman is raped and strangled in Minneapolis.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.136" offset="731420">Marshall Murphy, the Respondent in this case, was a suspect, was interviewed at that time but was never arrested and was never indicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.700" offset="761722">September 1980 Respondent was placed on probation for the crime of false imprisonment after a plea of guilty in that matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.627" offset="801428">The conditions of his probation included the normal ones, that he report to his probation officer as directed, that he be truthful to his probation officer in all matters, that he keep his probation officer informed of what he is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.689" offset="869660">There was also a specific condition of his probation that he attend a treatment program for sexual offenders known as Alpha House.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.332" offset="900276">His probation officer assigned was a woman named Mara Widseth.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.056" offset="919084">For the following year probationer, Respondent in this case, and the probation officer met on a monthly basis at the probation officer's office at times usually selected by Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.425" offset="968612">In July of 1981 Respondent left the treatment program.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.437" offset="988674">He was called into his probation officer's office.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.389" offset="1000481">They discussed the matter and she decided to allow him to continue on probation despite the fact he was no longer in the sexual offender treatment because she felt he was doing well in other areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.557" offset="1045099">Then September 22, 1981 the probation officer learned from a counselor at the Alpha House treatment program that Respondent had while in treatment at that program made admissions or told people that he had once committed a murder several years before.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.849" offset="1118346">When the probation officer learned that information, of course, she did not know whether that was true or false simply that those words apparently were said.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.994" offset="1150842">She did not go to the police to learn if any such case existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.208" offset="1167770">She made no contact with any other authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.350" offset="1180308">She did after talking with her supervisor decide that she should relay this information she had learned to the police and she also decided she should inform the Respondent probationer of her decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.996" offset="1230881">So on the 24th of September she sent him a letter requesting that he come into her office to discuss further treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.561" offset="1257108">She was concerned at that time--</text>

            <text syncTime="450.987" offset="1958862">The probation officer began that interview by telling Respondent exactly what she had learned from the Alpha House treatment program, that is, that he had made these comments about a murder and that she felt he needed further treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.544" offset="2013092">At that point Respondent became angry and upset.</text>

            <text syncTime="484.038" offset="2091041">The probation officer did not directly ask Murphy about this murder, did not directly confront him, never threatened to revoke him, simply posited the position that she felt based on what she had learned that he needed further treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="502.599" offset="2165334">He did that by first denying the false imprisonment charge for which he was in probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.883" offset="2190411">He claimed innocence, and he said further that at the time of this rape murder he had been involved with drugs quite heavily and that since he was no longer involved with drugs the two incidents were unrelated behaviorally.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.542" offset="2241089">The probation officer confronted him with his guilt on the false imprisonment charge and at that point without further prodding by this probation officer Respondent went ahead and in some detail described the 1974 murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.072" offset="2299185">At that point the probation officer informed him she would have to take this information to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.905" offset="2322486">Respondent commented that he understood that but that unless he confessed to the police it would simply be her word against his.</text>

            <text syncTime="810.740" offset="3397895">This Court has recognized, however, that the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination is not self-executing, that is, it must be claimed.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.158" offset="3443557">If a witness under compulsion to testify makes disclosures instead of claiming the privilege the government simply has not compelled him to incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="831.274" offset="3480024">The reason for that rule makes sense that a person in the circumstance as the Respondent in this case... There are many factors and circumstances which may compel one to incriminate himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.891" offset="3526418">Some may deal with government compulsion and some may deal with the person's own internal feelings or notions or ideas.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.837" offset="3554212">Unless the person attempts to claim or claims the privilege there is no way to know whether or not that individual made the admissions for reasons of his own or made the admissions as a result of governmental coercion or compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.497" offset="3612935">This Court has recognized very narrowly limited situations where one who does not claim that privilege may later assert it as a defense, and those, of course, are the inquiry here.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.936" offset="3670614">The inquiry narrowly is was the Defendant in custody or the Respondent in custody within the meaning of the Miranda case and the cases following; or secondly, absent custody were these admissions somehow coerced by genuine compulsion on the part of the government?</text>
            <text syncTime="897.776" offset="3745951">Now custody as defined last July by this Court in California v. Baylor means, of course, formal arrest and it also means a restraint of freedom of movement of the degree associated with formal arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="911.908" offset="3802480">In the facts of this case we have neither a formal arrest nor a restraint of freedom to that degree.</text>

            <text syncTime="1103.573" offset="4569226">I believe it is clear on the facts of this case and on the decisions of this Court that the defendant was not in custody within the meaning of Miranda.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.669" offset="4605588">There have been two lower court holdings, United States v. Miller out of the Second Circuit, United States v. Holmes out of the Eighth Circuit which agree with this conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.364" offset="4648325">I presume that in those situations the probationer was under the same sort of probation conditions as Respondent was here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1132.160" offset="4683538">So that leads me then to the second inquiry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.291" offset="4692106">Is there anything on the facts of this case that could be found to compel or to prohibit or deny this Respondent the free choice to admit, to deny or to claim the privilege?</text>
            <text syncTime="1146.480" offset="4740798">I believe as pointed out in the facts of this case there is no identifiable factor here which interfered with that free choice on his part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.975" offset="4774757">She never threatened him with revocation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1157.359" offset="4784370">She never threatened him with any sanction whatsoever had he claimed the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.011" offset="4802970">Since he did not he cannot now raise it in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.635" offset="4821464">Again, that inquiry looks further to the totality of the circumstances, and I point out briefly in that regard that the probation officer was acting on good faith in the performance of her dual role (1) to assist in the rehabilitation of the probationer, and (2) to protect the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.254" offset="4891890">She spoke with this man about treatment without threats or without coercion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1813.540" offset="7409050">The reason for that rule, of course, is that witnesses are often willing to speak even though they could be compelled to speak were they not willing, and unless a witness objects and asserts his privilege there is no reason to conclude that he was not answering willingly.</text>

            <text syncTime="2293.956" offset="9330721">He said I felt like calling a lawyer but once the probation officer then says to him you will have to deal with a lawyer outside the office because now I want to talk about treatment that prevented Murphy from making any other assertion of his Fifth Amendment rights.</text>

            <text syncTime="2312.319" offset="9404178">Mr. Wernick, I do not read the Supreme Court of Minnesota's opinion as relying on implied representations by the probation officer.</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.274" offset="9435943">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.295" offset="9440122">In the question presented by the State of Minnesota in its petition for certiorari they identify the fact that this was a compulsory process and that the probation officer had substantial reason to know that the answers would be incriminatory and, therefore, the privilege was self-executing at that point and this is a case where the Court could reach that issue and decided whether or not based on those two factors the privilege would b self-executing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.825" offset="9558196">I am saying this case also presents itself a third factor whether on these facts the probation officer impaired Murphy's ability to assert the privilege.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2360.352" stopTime="2365.383">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2360.352" offset="9596334">But that is asking us to make a factual finding that the Supreme Court of Minnesota did not find.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark S. Wernick</label>
            <text syncTime="2365.383" offset="9616397">Well, it is really a legal conclusion, Your Honor, I believe because the facts are in the Supreme Court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.726" offset="9637817">The facts are she had intended all along to report Murphy to the police and yet she made representations of treatment and she told them he could not call a lawyer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.662" offset="9673552">These facts are all in the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.853" offset="9682330">The Court said in more general language than just limiting it to the two factors I have identified the Court said in the same paragraph as a matter of due process where this probation officer had already decided to report Murphy to the police this cannot be used against him.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.646" offset="9749517">So I think the Court can affirm based on the facts that are in the Supreme Court opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.018" offset="9766966">When she told him again that she would not let him call a lawyer because she wanted to talk about this behavioral relationship I submit that when he first said he felt like calling a lawyer he was worried that the so-called cat had gotten out of the bag, but when she said you cannot call a lawyer because I want you to talk about this behavioral relationship at that point it was fair of him to assume that they were only talking about treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.558" offset="9881174">Indeed, I ask the Court to look closely at the confession in this case because the confession really is an explanation of why he does not need treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2441.225" offset="9919835">His confession is I am innocent of the false imprisonment charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2445.387" offset="9936449">At the time of the murder I was on drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2448.647" offset="9949510">I am not using drugs any more therefore the false imprisonment is not related to the murder and therefore I do not need treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2456.602" offset="9981275">This is his confession.</text>
            <text syncTime="2458.673" offset="9989634">Now it was after he made the confession the probation officer said well you know I have to go to the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2466.720" offset="10021817">It was at that point Murphy says, well, I understand that and then he says to his probation officer you must really care about me to have me come in and talk about this because you could have just picked up the phone and started dialing the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.790" offset="10086078">Again, Murphy was wrong about the nature of his confidentiality rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.755" offset="10105931">The federal statute is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2489.875" offset="10114395">The probation officer could not just have picked up the phone and called the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.108" offset="10135293">The language of the federal statute is that neither the treatment center nor the probation officer may initiate or substantiate a criminal prosecution based on information received from these federally funded treatment centers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.768" offset="10194016">So when Murphy said you just could have called the police again Murphy was wrong about his confidentiality rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.932" offset="10218676">The issue in this case does not turn on whether Murphy was in custody because she had this legal power to compel.</text>

            <text syncTime="3567.563" offset="14425121">When Murphy says I feel like calling a lawyer and when she tells him he cannot and when she tells him as to the nature of the interview she is not conducting herself in a way which is consistent with protecting the values underlying the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3581.603" offset="14481337">It seems to me, Your Honor, all parties in this case have agreed that the most important institutional need of the probation system is a trust relationship between the probationer and the probation officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3592.340" offset="14524282">If this Court puts its seal of approval on the conduct of the probation officer in this case then that institutional need would be undermined, and I ask the Court to affirm the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="3610.031" offset="14595022">A few points if I may, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.850" offset="14602336">As to the issue of a mention of a lawyer in this conversation on September 28th the constitutional right to a lawyer arises in only two circumstances that have been recognized by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.049" offset="14651133">That is the in-custody Miranda type of interrogation where the request for a lawyer is viewed by the prophylactic rules in that decision to affect protection of the Fifth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.457" offset="14696690">The only other situation is at a critical stage of a criminal proceeding and that is the true Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.250" offset="14719887">Neither of those two situations applies to a probation interview generally or to this one specifically.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.255" offset="14743920">Secondly, just to reiterate my major point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3650.306" offset="14756145">The privilege in the Fifth Amendment does not prohibit asking questions or asking incriminative questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3657.111" offset="14783312">It only prohibits the government from compelling self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.573" offset="14801180">The focus of that inquiry has to be on the words and deeds and actions of the governmental agent in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3668.549" offset="14829079">Either individually or in combination there are no factors identifiable here in the conduct of the probation officer which could be found under the existing decisions of this Court to compel his answers in the sense that he did not have the free choice to admit, deny or to claim the privilege.</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3685.780" offset="14898042">Mr. Lynn, what if Minnesota's parole conditions were a little less ambiguous because apparently there is some argument about what they really mean.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.234" offset="14931792">Supposing they said in so many words every probationer has an absolute duty to respond to every question propounded to him by the probation officer truthfully, fully in all detail concerning conduct during the probationary period, and the failure to respond to any such question shall be grounds for revocation of the probation, would there be any constitutional objection to that?</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="3718.982" offset="15030849">But you do not construe these parole conditions to require any such broad duty to respond as I understand your argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3728.048" offset="15067107">I would think the interest of the parole system would be served by maximizing the flow of communication rather than by creating situations where you have got to claim privileges and all the rest.</text>
