            <text syncTime="41.129" offset="308279">The statute at issue in this case requires wholesalers of liquor to pay a tax of 20 percent on their wholesale price.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.115" offset="348194">The statute defines liquor to include all alcoholic beverages, but it exempts, at least from 1971 to 1981, fruit wine, okolehao, made in Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.208" offset="408589">Thus, all products from out of state are taxed at a 20 percent rate, while most liquor made in Hawaii was not taxed.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.910" offset="443384">The difference can be many dollars per bottle.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.875" offset="455296">The challenge we press here is based on the Commerce Clause, the Import-Export Clause, and the Equal Protection Clause, because the principles underlying those clauses are very similar as applied to differential taxation of interstate transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.285" offset="520916">I will focus on the Commerce Claus at oral argument.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="117.579" offset="614121">No.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.019" offset="615792">Simply if... if the statute had just been across the board.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="120.621" offset="626241">An argument was raised in the state court that a tax of 20 percent levied on a base which includes all transportation charges and earlier taxes operates in practice as a discrimination under the principles of Pike against Bruce Church, but that argument is not being pursued in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.294" offset="704922">The argument on the Commerce Clause that we make here is rather straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.238" offset="728746">Since 1875 this Court has held that a state may not levy different taxes on products produced in state and products brought in from out of state.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.795" offset="774930">Such a differential taxation creates the very multiplicity of preferential trade zones that the Commerce Clause was designed to eliminate.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.662" offset="814428">In response to that fairly simple argument, the State Supreme Court gave three answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.828" offset="843058">One is that this tax is not designed to discriminate against out-of-state products, but instead to help local Hawaiian industry, and that therefore it has a legitimate purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.597" offset="898124">The second argument is that it's permissible to discriminate against out-of-state products so long as you permit all wholesalers to sell both the taxed product and the untaxed product.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.294" offset="952981">And third, the Supreme Court of Hawaii argued that the tax is fairly apportioned.</text>

            <text syncTime="237.086" offset="1092057">There was only one judgment entered by the Supreme Court of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.739" offset="1106685">And their view was that one appeal having been filed, they did not need to file additional notices of appeal to bring their case here.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="275.755" offset="1246806">Mr. Easterbrook, before you get into the three points of the Hawaiian Supreme Court's reasoning, those footnotes that point out that the two products that are exempted are apparently not widely produced throughout the world, o what extent do you contend that all alcoholic beverages are fungible?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_h_easterbrook" startTime="293.796" stopTime="357.330">
            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="293.796" offset="1318904">We... we say two things about that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.909" offset="1339384">The first is that the Hawaiian statute itself defines the pertinent category as all alcoholic beverages; and in fact, a Hawaii statute... it's Hawaii revised statute 281-1... defines okolehao to be an alcoholic beverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.141" offset="1408348">And the second part of our argument is that alcoholic beverages are reasonably substitutable in use; that someone who drinks okolehao is doing that in preference to tequila or benedictine, someone who drinks the wine that was made in Hawaii is doing that in preference to someone else's wine, and that that form of substitution is all that's necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.339" offset="1509076">And indeed, that's why they passed this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.828" offset="1515032">The legislative history suggests that one reason for exempting okolehao was to enable the producers to advertise nationwide and to boost it, as the legislative history said, to a position of tequila.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="357.330" stopTime="364.293">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="357.330" offset="1573128">Would your argument be the same if... on behalf of a wholesaler who stocked some of the exempted products?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_h_easterbrook" startTime="364.293" stopTime="367.245">
            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="364.293" offset="1600922">Yes, it would, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="367.245" stopTime="371.158">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="367.245" offset="1612730">You'd say even if you carried these products, that you'd still have the same--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_h_easterbrook" startTime="371.158" stopTime="556.448">
            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="371.158" offset="1628403">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.549" offset="1629970">That the prohibited discrimination is between products and that as a matter of Commerce Clause jurisprudence, the highest tax that can be levied on the product that comes in from out of state is the tax that's levied on the product from in state, and that taxation here is on the product directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.490" offset="1705725">Two of the three arguments I would like to dismiss very quickly, largely because the state has abandoned them.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.096" offset="1736132">One argument, which is that it is permissible to tax the products at different rates as long as you allow the wholesaler to sell the untaxed product, is inconsistent with the entire line of this Court's cases, and the State of Hawaii has properly abandoned it in Note 23 of its brief in this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.709" offset="1814604">The other argument, that so long as the tax is fairly apportioned to transactions in Hawaii, the discrimination is all right, is not even mentioned in this Court by the State of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.416" offset="1861415">None of the apportionment cases has to do with express discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.339" offset="1877089">Well, that leaves the argument that it's permissible to discriminate because it's beneficial to Hawaiian industry to do so; and that argument must fail, we submit, because it's nothing other than a frontal assault on the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.330" offset="1937066">This Court has implemented the Commerce Clause through a rule that no state may enact expressly protectionist laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.464" offset="1969667">No state may, at its own say-so, exalt its products at the expense of those from outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.388" offset="1997356">Now, we don't doubt that protectionism is often in fact in the interest of local industry, as the Supreme Court of Hawaii said it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.663" offset="2034450">We're not accusing the State of Hawaii of acting against its own interest in passing this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.179" offset="2056498">But the Supreme Court of Hawaii seemed to say that because this statute is in the interest of Hawaii that it's not an irrational law; therefore, it's a constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.035" offset="2099861">But quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="490.926" offset="2107489">It's precisely because protectionism is so often in the interest of local prosperity at the expense of those elsewhere that the Commerce Clause prohibits those kinds of discriminations.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.142" offset="2152315">That's why the national government must step in; a beggar thy neighbor policy is not a constitutional policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.628" offset="2182303">Discrimination may be practiced only if Congress, on behalf of Hawaii's many affected neighbors, permits it.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.554" offset="2209993">Now, that antidiscrimination principle is almost universally applicable, and it's been applied by this Court even when the state has advanced a legitimate reason in support of its discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="529.452" offset="2261611">In Philadelphia against New Jersey, for example, where the State of New Jersey attempted to prohibit the import of garbage from out of state, the State of New Jersey adopted and advanced in this Court a rational justification: that is, protection of the quality of its environment.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.551" offset="2329948">And the Court said that even a rational, well-supported justification cannot excuse blatant discrimination against interstate commerce.</text>

            <text syncTime="1183.524" offset="4877827">We have made two principal points about the 21st Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.435" offset="4893500">One is that the Court has consistently held that state liquor laws must yield when they conflict with actual federal statutes enacted pursuant to federal authority.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="1274.242" offset="5240720">The statute, the state statute, the South Carolina statute, which this Court considered in Scott against Donald, was a statute that did exactly that, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.248" offset="5276769">It prohibited the import into South Carolina of alcoholic beverages, but allowed people in South Carolina to brew their own and sell it to their hearts' content.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.994" offset="5311773">This Court held that the Wilson Act absolutely prohibited that state statute, and we think the same would be the case today under the Wilson Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.921" offset="5351479">The... more generally, the purpose of the 21st Amendment as this Court has construed it, especially in cases like Mid-Cal, has been to preserve a sphere within which the state may regulate in the name of temperance free of the meandering path of Commerce Clause cases, which in the past, especially the original package doctrine cases and the decision in Leisy against Hardin, it made it difficult, even impossible, for a state that desired to adopt temperance rules to adopt and enforce those rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1337.552" offset="5494003">The 21st Amendment made it sure that a state that wanted temperance could get it despite the original package line of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.987" offset="5527753">It established concurrent powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.789" offset="5538934">But this is not a case in which the state advocates that it has a temperance interest at heart.</text>
            <text syncTime="1356.085" offset="5568086">Quite the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.805" offset="5574983">The interest the state advocates is in getting more okolehao sold and more Hawaiian fruit wine sold to the extent it can possibly do that through this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.582" offset="5614062">So since the kind of interest involved in this case is not even assumed... not even asserted to be a temperance interest, the state's argument on the 21st Amendment ultimately is unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.682" offset="5666516">In all events, it seems to me important that as it survives now, it is at best a very attenuated argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1387.054" offset="5692011">It's an argument that you can think about the Commerce Clause through the lens of the 21st Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1393.860" offset="5719179">And given that attentuation, the state's argument is very weak.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.324" offset="5737046">On the other hand, we invoke on our behalf the James Beam case in which the Court held that the Foreign Commerce Clause makes it impossible for a state to levy discriminatory taxes on liquor when they would otherwise be prohibited by the Foreign Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.055" offset="5815936">Our argument is very simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.317" offset="5821056">It's that the Interstate Commerce Clause has the same force in liquor cases as the Foreign Commerce Clause does under the doctrine of Beam.</text>
            <text syncTime="1428.143" offset="5856374">Finally, the state has made a number of arguments which can be described only as fairness arguments.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.565" offset="5881974">The arguments have to do with retroactivity, with the passing on argument and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.570" offset="5906006">As I said earlier in response to Justice Blackmun's question, those arguments were not raised below; but we think it important to the extent they are here at all simply to point out that this is not a case like the Chevron Oil case where there has been a sudden, elusive change in the law which the state could not have anticipated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1463.256" offset="5996808">Since 1875 taxes of this sort have been plainly unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.868" offset="6015198">Since 1897 when this Court construed the Wilson Act, they have been unlawful as applied to liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.824" offset="6043097">And a whole lot of that line of cases has been cases for the refund of taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.597" offset="6066189">So ultimately, what the state is arguing in its fairness argument is that its tax is so large that the discrimination between the in-state and the out-of-state products is so great that it really ought to be allowed to keep it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.543" offset="6117912">And that's kind of like the argument of someone who's murdered both of his parents and gets called before the bar that he shouldn't get punished because he's an orphan; that he's made the stakes so big that he is entitled, therefore, to immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1506.733" offset="6170679">Well, the argument doesn't fly for the orphan, I don't think it flies for the State of Hawaii, and this judgment should be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.009" offset="6199832">Thanks very much.</text>

            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="1515.369" offset="6205265">Mr. Dexter.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_d_dexter" startTime="1523.915" stopTime="1789.607">
            <label>Mr. William D. Dexter</label>
            <text syncTime="1523.915" offset="6239433">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.967" offset="6255629">The Appellants argue that because for a five-year period Hawaii exempted okolehao and pineapple wine, which are made only in Hawaii, and which amounted to less than one percent of the total sales of alcoholic beverages in Hawaii, because of these circumstances they are entitled to a refund of all the taxes Hawaii imposed on all alcoholic beverages, amounting to approximately 10 percent of the annual budget of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.440" offset="6385510">Now, as indicated by their argument, Appellants can only get to this point by arguing that all alcoholic beverages compete with one another, and that the exemption, therefore, creates some kind of a per se discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.610" offset="6462205">This is contrary to a long line of decisions of this Court starting with Tiernan v. Rinker.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.497" offset="6493761">In Tiernan this Court held that the exemption of beer and wine produced in Texas did not invalidate a general liquor tax imposed on all sales of all liquor products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1599.933" offset="6543499">It recognized there that the exemption of beer and wine produced in Texas could only be discriminatory as to imported beer and wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.492" offset="6589683">So contrary to Appellants' universal argument, we believe that this case should be examined in light of the particular facts and circumstances here before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1626.340" offset="6649138">We are here dealing with two unique Hawaiian products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.684" offset="6666483">Okolehao is a traditional Hawaiian beverage distilled from the ti plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.120" offset="6700233">Originally it was drunk as a fermented mash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.122" offset="6712250">In 1970 explorers taught the natives how to distill the mash.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.835" offset="6735133">In fact, the term okolehao is the Hawaiian term for the iron caldron and the gun barrel used for this purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1655.980" offset="6767629">So we are dealing with a very unique, indigenous Hawaiian product, and it was so found by the Supreme Court of Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.257" offset="6808798">Also, I think it's important to realize that the Appellants here do not represent the manufacture of any out-state products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1677.975" offset="6855610">They are solely in-state wholesalers, and so they have to limit any claim of discrimination based on product discrimination and not because of their particular circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1696.618" offset="6930215">They as wholesalers have in no way been damaged here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.541" offset="6957905">Now, as found by the Supreme Court of Hawaii, also no okolehao or pineapple wine is produced anywhere else in the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.160" offset="7008374">And the Hawaii Supreme Court, because of this fact and because of the uniqueness of these products, specifically found that these exemptions had no effect whatsoever on interstate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.061" offset="7072008">And that is why the Hawaiian Supreme Court really analyzed the issue as one involving equal protection and not Commerce Clause considerations per se, including that of the 21st Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.569" offset="7126029">And also, it's important to note there's no allegation or proof in the record in these... this case that the exemptions adversely affected Appellants' business of importing beer and wine or had any effect on interstate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.854" offset="7211188">Before you get to any product discrimination case, you have to find that okolehao and a peculiar, distinct wine produced in Hawaii, pineapple wine, is competitive with the importation of beer and wine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1802.607" offset="7354235">This is a traditional cultural drink product of Hawaii, a tourist attraction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.181" offset="7380462">The Hawaiian legislature was trying to get that fledgling industry off of its feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.626" offset="7406271">When they granted the pineapple wine or the fruit wine exemption, there was absolutely no production in Hawaii, and apparently one person wanted to try to produce some kind of wine in one of the Hawaiian Islands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.837" offset="7467084">And so the exemptions were simply to try to promote either a traditional local industry, the production of okolehao, or the production of pineapple wine that was not in existence in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.846" offset="7531136">In fact, in 1976, the first year of the wine exemption, there was no sales of wine at all in Hawaii.</text>

            <text syncTime="2002.547" offset="8154000">I suggested no pineapple wine in production in 1976, very little in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.681" offset="8178450">Now, in 1976 when the exemption was enacted for pineapple wine in okolehao, this product, okolehao, amounted to two-tenths of one percent of the total liquor sales in Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.483" offset="8249712">It amounted to only 3.7 percent of the total liquor produced in Hawaii and sold in Hawaii.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.299" offset="8284925">It was a very minor exemption, and the exemptions, as I indicated, were for a very limited period of time for this express purpose of trying to create a market.</text>
            <text syncTime="2046.605" offset="8330170">Now, against this factual background I would like to have the Court consider the following points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2052.158" offset="8352426">First, the exemptions in question in our judgment are not distinguishable from direct subsidies to preserve Hawaii's cultural heritage, the production of okolehao, and to promote a new industry such as pineapple wine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.380" offset="8409268">Secondly, I would like to address the question of the complete absence of any discrimination as a matter of fact in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.208" offset="8456602">And I believe, Your Honors, that if there is no discrimination as a matter of fact as to these Appellants or interstate or foreign commerce, there cannot be any discrimination as a matter of constitutional law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.315" offset="8509056">I think this is rather fundamental by examination of the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.670" offset="8530476">And the third point I would like to make, that any decision on the merits in favor of Appellant should be given only prospective application, because contrary to the argument of the Appellants in this case, we believe that the 21st Amendment rules would be changed substantially if these small, innocuous exemptions in the Hawaiian liquor law were construed by this Court to invalidate the entire Hawaiian liquor law under the Commerce Clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2510.571" offset="10186013">We're saying that the nature of the exemption here and its effect on interstate or foreign commerce or Appellants' business is identical as if Hawaii had included the okolehao and pineapple wine sales as taxable sales and granted these parties a dollar amount subsidy in the exact amount of a tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2537.749" offset="10294787">And certainly I think there is... is... is a problem, as you suggest, in that area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2544.141" offset="10320282">We're saying the intent and purpose here, the operative effect of what was done is analogous to a subsidy, because... and Appellants in this case admit that if these were... these were direct payments, there wouldn't be any problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2562.734" offset="10394679">We're simply saying here that... that... that form and substance should control in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.028" offset="10427907">And I think that in terms of looking at this, whether it is a... intended to discriminate or burden commerce rather than as a subsidy that we have to realize again that the exemptions were enacted to preserve Hawaii's cultural heritage and to promote a new industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.102" offset="10496139">They were not enacted as trade barriers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2593.495" offset="10517768">And the fact that in 1976 when the exemptions were enacted 96.7 percent of locally-produced Hawaiian liquor products was taxed indicates the limited and peculiar nature of... of these exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.536" offset="10593941">We believe that these facts establish that the exemptions were in the nature of subsidies as intended by the Hawaiian legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.602" offset="10622153">And we also believe that they were intended to promote a business or a market and not intended in any way to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2633.099" offset="10676174">Now, turning to point two, I would just simply like to emphasize again there's nothing in the record to establish that the exempt products here were competitive with beer and wine of the Appellant or impeded any interstate or foreign commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.901" offset="10747332">This is a basic factual issue the Appellants have not tried to prove in any way or tried to meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.597" offset="10778156">Now, since the exempted products were not produced anywhere else, there can be no discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.682" offset="10802503">That is a matter of fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="2666.372" offset="10809294">As here indicated, Appellants assume, as they must, that all alcoholic beverages compete with each other in commerce; therefore, the exemption of a single type of liquor discriminates against all other liquor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.103" offset="10872197">However, the Court should exercise, in our judgment, great care in determining what constitutes product discrimination or state constitutional purposes, particularly liquor products which are covered by the 21st Amendment--</text>
            <text syncTime="2699.234" offset="10940743">Now, as I've indicated, this Court in the Tiernan case has already indicated that the exemption of beer and wine by... locally-produced beer and wine by Texas did not invalidate a Texas liquor law except to the extent of competing beer and wine coming in from out of state.</text>

            <text syncTime="3179.722" offset="12862623">A few brief words about the argument about the extent of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3184.544" offset="12881954">I'm perfectly delighted to concede that was not tried as an antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.349" offset="12901180">We don't have a Section 7 Clayton Act market definition in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.889" offset="12915286">There were some good reasons why that's true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.370" offset="12925213">One is that the stipulation wasn't addressed to this because the state never asserted this in the initial court, and it's very difficult as a practical matter for litigants to cover in stipulations things that their opponents aren't denying.</text>
