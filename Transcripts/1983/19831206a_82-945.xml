            <label>Mr. Michael R. Flaherty</label>
            <text syncTime="86.269" offset="497732">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, is it an unfair labor practice for employer to ask the Immigration and Naturalization Service to investigate the immigration status of its employees?</text>
            <text syncTime="101.738" offset="559590">That is the first and the most important issue presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.903" offset="580279">Can an employer be required to pay illegal aliens a sum of money equal to six months' pay under the National Labor Relations Act covering a period of time when the illegal aliens are not present in this country, when they are in Mexico, and they are not lawfully available for work?</text>
            <text syncTime="126.324" offset="657915">That is the second issue presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.997" offset="672648">And can the National Labor Relations Board require an employer to write reinstatement offers in Spanish and to leave them open for a period of four years?</text>
            <text syncTime="142.256" offset="721654">That is the third issue presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.368" offset="734088">The operative facts in this case begin on January 20th, 1977, when Mr. John Surak, the president of Sure-Tan, wrote this letter to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.849" offset="792080">He asked the Immigration and Naturalization Service to investigate the immigration status of his employees.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="166.461" offset="818516">Incidentally, does he know the immigration status of his present employees?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="michael_r_flaherty" startTime="171.985" stopTime="478.999">
            <label>Mr. Michael R. Flaherty</label>
            <text syncTime="171.985" offset="840563">Your Honor, I don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.067" offset="852893">I have not asked Mr. Surak that, and so I just cannot answer that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.212" offset="877553">In response to this letter, the INS came to Mr. Surak's facility and investigated the immigration status of the employees, and in response to this letter it was discovered that the illegal aliens... that the employees were illegal aliens, five of the eight of them listed on this letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.059" offset="968877">They were immediately arrested by the INS, and they were permitted to execute an INS form whereby they acknowledged their illegal presence in this country, and then they voluntary agreed to return to Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.958" offset="1028436">The union filed an unfair labor practice charge against the employer, and the Labor Board returned a complaint, charging that Sure-Tan violated Section 883 of the National Labor Relations Act by discharging the employees when it sent this letter to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.282" offset="1109834">In an attempt to resolve this dispute, Sure-Tan sent letters offering reinstatement to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.454" offset="1138464">They were written in English, and they were sent on March 29th, 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.920" offset="1160302">They asked the employees to report to work by May 1st, 1977, if they accepted the offers of reinstatement.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.214" offset="1189559">In the proceedings below, the Labor Board held that Sure-Tan constructively discharged the employees, in violation of Section 8(a)(3) of the Act by sending this letter to the INS requesting the INS investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.795" offset="1251835">The Board ordered Sure-Tan to offer unconditional reinstatement to the aliens, and it ordered them to pay them back pay.</text>
            <text syncTime="287.363" offset="1302095">In response to this order, the board's own general counsel filed a motion for clarification, asking the board just what it meant by this order.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.550" offset="1346816">The general counsel observed in its motion for clarification that an order that required unconditional reinstatement with back pay, regardless of the aliens' immigration status, created a conflict with the immigration laws and policies.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.462" offset="1418496">It in effect served as an incentive for these aliens to re-enter the country illegally.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.317" offset="1441902">Well, the board denied the motion, but in the decision denying the motion, it said that the accrual of back pay should be tolled during the period of time when the illegal aliens were unavailable for lawful employment in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.516" offset="1510761">The Court of Appeals upheld the order with certain modifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.850" offset="1532077">Under the Court of Appeals' enforcement decree, the illegal aliens would have to be reinstated by Sure-Tan only if they can establish at the time they present themselves for employment that they are lawfully available for work in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.739" offset="1587561">With respect to the back pay issue, the Court of Appeals went way beyond the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.113" offset="1617131">It invented its own remedy, or so-called remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.937" offset="1632387">It told Sure-Tan that it would have to pay each of these illegal aliens a minimum of six months' pay, regardless of whether they were lawfully available for work in this country.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.114" offset="1677109">This was on the theory that the illegal aliens would have remained in this country illegally for some period of time but for this request sent to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.772" offset="1723711">The Court of Appeals also held that Sure-Tan would have to write its own statement letters in Spanish, and it would have to leave them open for a period of four years.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.879" offset="1768119">The most important issue facing this Court in this case is whether an employer can be held liable under the National Labor Relations Act for reporting a violation of the law to the immigration authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.847" offset="1824021">This case or this issue has already been decided by this Court six months ago in the Bill Johnson's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.185" offset="1865399">In Bill Johnson's, an employer... or employees picketed one of Bill Johnson's restaurants.</text>
            <text syncTime="436.560" offset="1898940">The owner of that one... of the restaurant told the employees he would get even with them if it was the last thing he did, and he made good on this threat.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.817" offset="1935930">He filed a civil lawsuit against the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.757" offset="1947633">This Court held that the filing of a civil lawsuit was protected under the First Amendment right to petition the government, regardless of the employer's motive for filing that lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="460.075" offset="1992981">That is precisely the issue that is presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.149" offset="2009282">Sure-Tan's request to the Immigration and Naturalization Service was squarely within the First Amendment right to petition the government, just as was the lawsuit filed by Bill Johnson's Restaurants.</text>

            <text syncTime="478.999" offset="2068632">What if it is found as a matter of fact that the employer acted solely because of his opposition to the union and the employees' desire to have a union?</text>
            <text syncTime="491.224" offset="2117533">What if it were found that that was the sole reason for his going to the INS?</text>

            <text syncTime="2011.119" offset="8197167">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, before beginning, I would like to emphasize two points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.012" offset="8228723">One, in response to Mr. Justice White's question, this was a case in which the board held that the employer was motivated solely by antiunion animus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.268" offset="8265713">We don't view that as an essential attribute of the violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.513" offset="8286715">Under Transportation Management the test would be whether the employer would have done it even in the absence of the antiunion animus, but here the court found that aggravated circumstance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.288" offset="8325794">And secondly, in petitioner's brief on the merits, they acknowledge that they were not challenging the board's finding of antiunion animus in the circumstances of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2055.646" offset="8375218">Now, this Court recognized in Plyler versus Doe and in United States versus Brignoni-Ponce that illegal aliens are especially vulnerable to exploitation by employers, and in De Canas, the Court recognized that the acceptance by illegal aliens of jobs on substandard conditions has the effect of depressing the wages and working conditions of lawfully resident American workers, and also undermines the effectiveness of labor unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.329" offset="8505935">We submit that the appropriate accommodation of the National Labor Relations Act and the immigration laws in the circumstances of this case requires a recognition of those realities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3743.687" offset="15127453">I would like to address Bill Johnson's and the First Amendment issue for just a moment, if I could.</text>
            <text syncTime="3747.708" offset="15143440">The First Amendment by its terms refers to petitioning for redress of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.262" offset="15161726">That is what was going on in Bill Johnson's, because the employer went to court to try to get a remedy for a legal injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3759.288" offset="15189834">That is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3761.028" offset="15196730">There was no legal injury suffered by the employer here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.621" offset="15211149">The other distinguishing factor, countervailing consideration in Bill Johnson's was the deeply rooted interest of the states in providing a remedy for wrongs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.038" offset="15256811">That is not... that federalism question is not presented here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3779.200" offset="15269455">A last distinguishing factor is that the employer himself knowingly facilitated the employment of the illegal aliens in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3789.495" offset="15310624">It does not come with good grace, I submit, for the employer to then turn around and rely on the immigration laws, whose violation is encouraged as a basis for avoiding liability under the labor laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.105" offset="15361092">This is not the first occasion in which these concerns have been raised, even with this employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3806.988" offset="15380632">This employer was the subject of prior unfair labor practice proceedings in 1973 in which the board then found that except for a few senior employees, all of the employer's employees were Mexican nationals, and on that occasion the employer again had intimidated his Mexican employees by making it clear that they would be fired and he would hire another one if they supported the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3834.355" offset="15490033">So this case highlights very strongly the concerns that underlie our submission here, and that is that if, as Justice Stevens pointed out, that an employer would have a powerful incentive and weapon to hire aliens in violation of the immigration laws if the decision of the Court of Appeals were reversed in these circumstances, and that would subvert the purposes of both the labor laws and of the immigration statutes.</text>
