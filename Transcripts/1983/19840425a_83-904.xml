            <text syncTime="8.404" offset="178685">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, on January 25, 1979, one Thomas Hill was shot to death at his apartment in the City of Mentor on the Lake, Lake County, State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="24.914" offset="244723">The defendant in this case was arrested within 12 hours, and a preliminary hearing was held within five days in Mentor Municipal Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.935" offset="280876">But the defendant/respondent, was released because the city prosecutor only charged the defendant with murder, and at the preliminary hearing stage, failed to introduce a certified copy of Thomas Hill's death certificate.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.795" offset="348272">As a result, the charge of murder was dismissed, and Thomas Hill was released, and his bond released also.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.818" offset="376380">Subsequently, on February 13, 1979, the Lake County Grand Jury found probable cause existed to believe that the defendant, respondent in this case, had violated four separate criminal statutes and returned one indictment charging this defendant/respondent with one count each of murder, involuntary manslaughter, aggravated robbery, and grand theft.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.904" offset="496752">The defendant/respondent had already filed the jurisdiction before the Grand Jury indictment had returned.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.224" offset="526009">And 20 months later he was apprehended in the State of Tennessee and returned to the State of Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.847" offset="556520">On October 9, 1980, the defendant/respondent appeared before the Lake County Common Pleas Court for the purposes of arraignment on the aforementioned indictment.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.023" offset="613154">At that point, he proffered pleas of guilty to involuntary manslaughter and grand theft, and not guilty pleas to murder and aggravated robbery.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.981" offset="669056">The State objected.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.499" offset="679087">Bond was set, and the case assigned to a different trial court, which had then to decide whether to accept the proffered pleas of guilty which the first court reserved ruling upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.978" offset="741049">On November 26, 1980, following written arguments, without any testimony or evidence even proffered, the trial court was persuaded by the defendant/respondent to exercise its discretion and accepted the guilty pleas on involuntary manslaughter and grand theft.</text>

            <text syncTime="271.671" offset="1231733">On November 26, 1980, following the written arguments, without any testimony even offered or proffered, the trial court was persuaded to accept the guilty pleas, as I said.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.497" offset="1283038">The court sentenced the defendant/respondent to consecutive sentences, three to ten years on involuntary manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.751" offset="1316057">That is... in the State of Ohio we have indeterminate sentences, so it is a minimum of three to ten years, and of course the minimum can be reduced by the Ohio Adult Parole Authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.042" offset="1353255">And the second sentence was two to five years on grand theft, to be served consecutively.</text>

            <text syncTime="328.609" offset="1459521">Following these pleas the defendant/respondent moved to dismiss the murder and aggravated robbery counts on the grounds of double jeopardy, arguing multiple prosecution and collateral estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.084" offset="1513438">On March 31, 1981 the trial courts, after briefs and arguments, again without any evidence or testimony even proffered, granted the defendant's motion to dismiss on the double jeopardy grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.145" offset="1581670">Thereupon, the State appealed to the trial court's dismissal of the murder and aggravated robbery.</text>

            <text syncTime="390.934" offset="1708834">The State appealed this dismissal to the Court of Appeals and again, based on double jeopardy provisions and understandings of the double jeopardy provisions of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, the appeal was affirmed, the trial court's dismissal on those grounds; thereupon, we appealed to the State Supreme Court, which on August 31, 1983 affirmed the Court of Appeals' decision upholding the trial court's dismissal, again all based on federal double jeopardy understandings and provisions.</text>

            <text syncTime="2750.217" offset="11145934">Well, fundamentally, the argument on the other side, based on Jeffers, is that there was a waiver of your double jeopardy claim because you elected to make two proceedings out it rather than one.</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert L. Purola</label>
            <text syncTime="2763.875" offset="11200582">The fundamental difference with Jeffers, however, Jeffers did three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2769.362" offset="11222525">He first denied that the two offenses were the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2772.897" offset="11236631">He secondly overtly opposed trial together on the offenses, the 846 and 848 section, and (3) he never told the trial judge or the prosecution what might be happening.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.454" offset="11282920">Kenneth Johnson does not fit any of those, because again I have to point out that in Jeffers there was an arraignment and a not-guilty plea and two trials scheduled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.846" offset="11324507">When that happens, the prosecutor... U.S. attorney in that case... becomes an integral part of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.416" offset="11350734">One of my major points in this Court is that on state law, when the arraignment is the first opportunity one has to plead to the indictment, a plea of guilty will obviate the necessity of the prosecutor's involvement with regard to that and eliminate the necessity of a proceeding on the same offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.813" offset="11428370">That is different than Jeffers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.263" offset="11434117">Jeffers did clearly deny that the two offenses were the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2825.698" offset="11447910">Johnson took precisely the opposite tack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2828.550" offset="11459299">Jeffers also wanted two separate trials once the issue was joined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.704" offset="11475913">That's not what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2834.454" offset="11482914">The issue wasn't joined at all on the involuntary manslaughter and the theft, and clearly the court knew what the defendant's motion was going to be after the plea was accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.012" offset="11525128">In fact, what this points to is that this somewhat unusual set of proceedings is maybe an aberrant state law arrangement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.201" offset="11565879">It maybe isn't a double jeopardy matter because the double jeopardy clause shouldn't be implicated if this whole problem could have been corrected or could be corrected by a state law ruling or a state law modification, which I think is an excellent reason for this court not to produce a decision on the double jeopardy clause on this fact setting, which is unusual, likely to be unrepeated, at least in most cases, and I think that the state law thing is the way to handle this position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2892.660" offset="11715717">The government argues in the amicus brief of the United States that they would just suggest to you, if this were a federal case, that the plea be vacated because it's beyond the power of the federal court to accept it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.133" offset="11757617">That isn't the rule in the federal courts either.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.183" offset="11765872">But this Court clearly, under its power, could suggest that, if not order it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.721" offset="11788024">But in state law, that's not a matter for this Court to decide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2914.173" offset="11801817">With regard to why a second trial now, or a trial now will be a second prosecution... and I point out that Pearce uses the word "prosecution", not "trial"... would violate the double jeopardy clause is that this is a guilt-related ending of the first proceeding which is significantly different than other interruptions in proceedings that are not guilt-related.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.912" offset="11940788">And that difference has always made a... I mean that distinction has always made a difference to the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.000" offset="11961059">In this particular case, Johnson's guilt was established on the very first day, at least to the facts that took place on January 25, 1979.</text>

            <text syncTime="2979.967" offset="12064922">He could have nolle'd it at his will.</text>
            <text syncTime="2983.335" offset="12078401">And I guess the timing is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.871" offset="12092612">The original arraignment on October 9th did not result in the final entry of any plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.541" offset="12115286">That judge reserved ruling, sent it to the judge that drew the case, and it wasn't finally decided until the following month.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.797" offset="12152275">With regard to one issue that may seem to be in this case, the idea of continuing jeopardy, one that this Court has grappled with, if not directly, at least tangentially recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3018.676" offset="12219776">It's clear that continuing jeopardy has never been undertaken, at least in the sense of Justice Holmes's dissent, to be an acceptable way of analyzing double jeopardy principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="3032.483" offset="12275051">This case is much like Reed v. Jones in the sense that no analysis could allow the prosecution to go forward on the theory that Mr. Johnson is still in jeopardy, and that's why I think the case decided last Wednesday about Lydon talks about the termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.551" offset="12375257">But I think that ends the jeopardy, because the justifications for a continuing jeopardy referred to in last week's case all seem to be met in this case, and I don't think this would be the case, if this Court were ever inclined to adopt a continuing jeopardy notion to perhaps give the State the right to stay in the case, I don't think this would be the case to adopt it in, though I certainly don't suggest it should be adopted at all, but ideas of fairness to society, lack of finality, and limited waiver are all, in this case, resolved in favor of the respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3096.759" offset="12532096">It may not be what all would choose, but the fact that Mr. Johnson has been convicted of involuntary manslaughter and been imprisoned for the maximum term allowed by state law, by the trial judge, is fair to society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.685" offset="12591864">He is not escaping this conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.470" offset="12602940">He was consequently, or in addition, was sentenced consecutively for the theft which was never challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="3121.707" offset="12631884">It is final, another suggestion in Justice White's opinion last week that deals with continuing jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.480" offset="12659051">This is final.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.797" offset="12664275">There isn't any obvious need to not have this over with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.484" offset="12687054">It is over, and there's clearly no waiver of Mr. Johnson's right to end his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.221" offset="12714013">My time is nearly over.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.589" offset="12723417">I would like to end by saying that this unique case is not the vehicle, in my view, to change again the principles of double jeopardy that have started to be changed in recent years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.855" offset="12816517">It seems that this country survived a very long time on very few double jeopardy opinions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3190.268" offset="12906169">But I believe that the principles of cases like ex parte Lang and Perez and Nielsen are sufficient to govern double jeopardy jurisprudence.</text>

            <text syncTime="3232.964" offset="13076906">The Fifth Amendment provisions and protections that have steered this entire case through the courts rely upon prohibitions against unlawful government oppressive practices, protections afforded to the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.961" offset="13156945">In Singer, though, the Court... this Court... has stated that the State and the government does have a right to one full trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3261.317" offset="13190382">And we ask for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.600" offset="13195502">There has been no State action by the prosecutor, by the State of Ohio, that is oppressive, that is burdensome, that is placing an extra burden upon this accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.641" offset="13247642">All that has happened is he has chosen to attempt a ploy that would now put restrictive and very binding confines on the application of the double jeopardy provisions to the State in these matters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3293.169" offset="13317755">2941.25 of the Ohio Revised Code is a statutory embodiment of the federal law in this area, and it's intended to extend, by statute, the protections of the Fifth Amendment to the defendant and, in doing so, it extends also the weighing and balancing tests that must be performed and the intended protections must be weighed v. the public interest, both by the double jeopardy provisions and by 2941.25.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.890" offset="13448680">The State did exactly what it was required to do.</text>
