            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="134785">We will hear arguments first this morning in Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation against Gray and the consolidated case.</text>

            <label>Mr. Baruch A. Fellner</label>
            <text syncTime="14.391" offset="192254">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is on appeal from the Ninth Circuit holding an Act of Congress unconstitutional with respect to its brief retroactive period.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.720" offset="285564">We submit that in making the statute in question retroactive, Congress met the rationality standard under the Turner Elkhorn case, and acted in accord with tax law precedent.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.497" offset="344705">The statute at issue, the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 was passed after approximately a year and a half of Congressional deliberation in order to improve the financial stability of over 2,000 multi-employer plans covering approximately eight million participants.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.499" offset="452747">Congress perceived that the greatest threat to plan stability was employer withdrawals, particularly in declining industries.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.074" offset="506978">Such withdrawals cause what Congress called a downward spiral.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.997" offset="534772">They reduce the amount of contributions which support retirement benefits, necessitating higher contributions from remaining employers, and thereby cauterizing their withdrawals from these plans, obviously jeopardizing the plan's solvency.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.545" offset="632888">Now, Congress was aware of the fact that as of 1978, 10 percent of all plans covering about 1.3 million participants were experiencing financial difficulties, and therefore, in order to achieve the goal of overall multi-employer plan stability, Congress rationally sought to eliminate what it observed were the incentives encouraging the flight from plans, and to cushion the financial impact of such withdrawals.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.439" offset="800489">The Multi-Employer Act assesses against a withdrawing employer a reasonable share of the costs of funding retirement benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.330" offset="852003">We submit--</text>

            <text syncTime="181.365" offset="860153">What do we mean, exactly, Mr. Fellner, by the term "withdrawing employer"?</text>

            <text syncTime="185.234" offset="875618">--A withdrawing employer is an employer who has contributed to a multi-employer plan and chooses to, as defined under the statute, cease his obligations, cease contributing to a multi-employer plan.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.528" offset="940819">Well, now, how does that come about contractually?</text>
            <text syncTime="203.730" offset="949701">The next time the collective bargaining agreement is up, the employer just says, I won't agree to make any contributions to the pension fund?</text>

            <label>Mr. Baruch A. Fellner</label>
            <text syncTime="211.884" offset="982302">There are a variety of circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.420" offset="988362">One, the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.038" offset="1002886">A withdrawal can also be incurred as a result of simply closing a business or selling a business.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.276" offset="1027859">A variety of different and I dare say complex circumstances under which withdrawals do in fact occur under the statute, not necessarily linked to the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.849" offset="1070178">Now, Congress, we submit, rationally concluded that withdrawing employers should pay their fair share of the unfunded liabilities they leave behind rather than shifting those liabilities to remaining employers, to employers who continue to contribute to multi-employer plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.865" offset="1166204">Withdrawal liability therefore, we submit, was the cornerstone of the legislative recommendations submitted at the request of Congress by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation on February 27, 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.676" offset="1241436">From that date forward, every bill, every Committee report incorporated a retroactive date, and that was in order to eliminate the incentive to withdraw during the legislative process.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.209" offset="1327536">Indeed, I would submit that it was the very openness and thoroughness of the legislative process which necessitated the retroactive period.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.999" offset="1378736">Congress was rational in legislating retroactively where to do otherwise--</text>

            <text syncTime="317.903" offset="1406321">Mr. Fellner, may I ask one question?</text>
            <text syncTime="320.022" offset="1414785">It is a little bit like Justice Rehnquist's in a way.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.057" offset="1422935">Could you just, when it is convenient for you, kind of explain to me how the magnitude of the withdrawal liability is calculated?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="baruch_a_fellner" startTime="329.795" stopTime="352.926">
            <label>Mr. Baruch A. Fellner</label>
            <text syncTime="329.795" offset="1453864">--Withdrawal liability is calculated as follows, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.365" offset="1472150">It is a proportion of the unfunded vested benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.353" offset="1500153">Unfunded vested benefits are defined as the actuarial present value of the retirement benefits that have to be paid over time.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="352.926" offset="1546442">Now, is that of the entire unfunded vested benefits or just the employees for whom the particular employers contributed?</text>

          <turn speaker="baruch_a_fellner" startTime="359.996" stopTime="424.023">
            <label>Mr. Baruch A. Fellner</label>
            <text syncTime="359.996" offset="1574759">It is roughly equivalent to the contributions which the employer has made up to that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.619" offset="1609241">If I may describe the manner in which it is computed, the amount by which this actuarial equivalent or the actuarial amount of unfunded vested benefits exceeds the assets available to pay them over time is multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the contributions which the employer has made over a five-year period, the denominator of which is the contributions made by all employers to this plan over the same five-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.631" offset="1785306">And therefore, as we suggest in our brief, it is the rough equivalent of the contributions this employer has made up to that point.</text>

            <text syncTime="424.023" offset="1830863">What is the... I may just show my ignorance here, but I might as well show it now rather than later, I guess.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.927" offset="1858449">What is the typical collective bargaining agreement provision that an employer enters into with a union?</text>
            <text syncTime="438.413" offset="1888437">It is not to ultimately pay a pension liability to a retired employee, but simply to pay a certain contribution per employee?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="baruch_a_fellner" startTime="447.186" stopTime="500.337">
            <label>Mr. Baruch A. Fellner</label>
            <text syncTime="447.186" offset="1923441">The typical collective bargaining agreement I think is difficult to describe.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.440" offset="1944444">Let me answer the question as follows.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.458" offset="1952594">This Court decided the case Amex Coal.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.327" offset="1964088">In Amex Coal, the trust agreement bound the trustees to the negotiated benefits in the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
            <text syncTime="469.552" offset="2012989">In other words, collective bargaining agreements and trust agreements take different forms.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.121" offset="2035245">Many of them are precisely as you have described, Justice Rehnquist, namely that employers do negotiate only the contributions which they ultimately make.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.679" offset="2081430">However, there are other trust agreements which bind the trustees to the negotiated for benefits in the collective bargaining agreements, one example of which is Amex Coal.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="500.337" stopTime="503.372">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="500.337" offset="2136078">But now do those agreements also bind the employers?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="baruch_a_fellner" startTime="503.372" stopTime="518.799">
            <label>Mr. Baruch A. Fellner</label>
            <text syncTime="503.372" offset="2148199">Clearly.</text>
            <text syncTime="504.189" offset="2151438">They bind the employers with regard to the contributions which they make which support specific benefits either provided for in the trust agreements or provided for explicitly in the collective bargaining agreement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="518.799" stopTime="529.504">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="518.799" offset="2209952">But the typical collective bargaining agreement doesn't contain a provision whereby an employer promises to pay any individual employee a pension of so much at the time he retires.</text>

          <turn speaker="baruch_a_fellner" startTime="529.504" stopTime="548.568">
            <label>Mr. Baruch A. Fellner</label>
            <text syncTime="529.504" offset="2252793">That is correct, but the realities of collective bargaining we submit, however, and describe in detail in our brief, are such that these contributions are clearly not negotiated in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.878" offset="2298246">They are negotiated with an eye toward the benefits which they will support.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.216" offset="2315592">Now, we submit that Congress was--</text>

            <text syncTime="548.568" offset="2328966">May I ask just one other question if I could, because I think I have the concept in mind now.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.436" offset="2344431">With respect to the amount that the... the withdrawal liability that these three companies incurred, how did that amount compare with the total contributions they had made during the preceding five-year period?</text>

            <text syncTime="589.811" offset="2493956">In the alterative, it was offered the opportunity to pay $65,000 a year, which was almost the precise equivalent of the contributions which it had been making over the prior five year.</text>

            <text syncTime="632.138" offset="2663334">Now, under the Turner Elkhorn rationality doctrine, Congress's reasonable decision in this case to, as it were, protect the efficacy of this complex legislation through a brief retroactive period is entitled to judicial deference.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.683" offset="2737417">Contrary to the court below, three circuit courts upheld that Turner Elkhorn controls the disposition of the constitutional issues before this Court, and furthermore, Congress carefully measured the liability imposed on withdrawing employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.632" offset="2821218">It enacted numerous moderating provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.417" offset="2836369">Just several examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.369" offset="2848176">It lessened most employers' withdrawal liability by as much as $50,000, particularly aiming that provision at small employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.141" offset="2883285">It enacted a net worth limitation on the liability of an employer which sells or closes its business.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.414" offset="2916408">It specifically reduced the impact of retroactivity on certain employers, and it stretched out payments over as much as 20 years and made them, as Justice Stevens pointed out, the rough equivalent of prior contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.709" offset="2989551">Moreover, under the Act withdrawing employers bear only a part of the cost of plan stability.</text>
            <text syncTime="724.232" offset="3031660">Participants, the pensioners, the retirees suffer losses because the levels of benefits now guaranteed under the Multi-Employer Act are lower than the levels guaranteed under prior law.</text>
            <text syncTime="741.109" offset="3099161">They, too, suffer losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.728" offset="3105639">Remaining employers share the cost of plan stability as well, because the Multi-Employer Act provides for faster funding, necessitating higher contributions from those who continue to participate and contribute to multi-employer plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.273" offset="3179827">Covered plans in general shoulder the additional burdens of higher premiums which are phased in from a 50 cent per employee premium to $2.60, and as one court put it, Congress spread the pain around.</text>

            <label>Mr. Baruch A. Fellner</label>
            <text syncTime="804.850" offset="3354116">I don't apologize for it, Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.968" offset="3366654">I know that that is precisely how it is described by appellee and his nine amici.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.971" offset="3390583">We submit that it was not political pressure, but it was a realization as described by Senator Bentsen on April 29th on the floor of the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.083" offset="3455053">It was an attempt, a realization, rather, that it had done much of its work already retroactively.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.753" offset="3489743">Retroactivity is part of the original package, was February 27, 1979.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.009" offset="3514821">Between February 27, 1979, and April 28th, 1980, Congress concluded that retroactivity had done its job.</text>
            <text syncTime="855.781" offset="3557871">In addition, it underscores the rationality of Congress's decision, because Congress took into consideration the fact that some employers had embarked on a course of action prior to February 27th which would lead to their ultimate withdrawal, and Congress took that fairness factor into consideration, concluding that it would be unfair to retroactively attach liability to employers who even before this package was submitted to Congress and recommendations were submitted to Congress, that it would be unfair for them to have retroactive liability attached to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.727" offset="3729652">Now, there is some language with regard to political pressure.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.345" offset="3744072">There were some grumblings on the part of some of the Senators to that effect, but we would submit that the two realities I indicated before are the real reasons for the advancement of the date.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.987" offset="3786703">Now, I would like to dwell, if I may, Justice Blackmun, a little bit more on this historical context, because we submit that it does support the rationality of what Congress did here.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.395" offset="3840307">If one message came through loud and clear when ERISA was passed in 1974, it was that employers involved in defined benefit plans were responsible for the funding of those plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.874" offset="3922227">No longer could employers walk away scott free, as Senator Matsunaga put it, leaving other employers holding the bag even where they had contractually limited their liability to specified contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.455" offset="4000594">Now, the full extension of this principle to the multi-employer plan world was delayed by the Congress in order to allow thorough analysis of the special problems which are inherent in such plans, and therefore beginning in 1977, Congress passed legislation on four different occasions which delayed the full implementation of the existing program to multi-employer contributing employers, alerting those employers that changes in the existing program should be anticipated, and therefore even before withdrawal liability and its retroactive feature were considered by the Congress for a 17-month period, employers in this heavily regulated industry, in this heavily regulated area, were given a full opportunity to know that Congress was examining alternative legislative solutions to the problem of multi-employer plans' instability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1041.270" offset="4299853">Now, once the legislative process began, we submit, employers were then on further notice that Congress was strongly considering changing their contingent liability under the old statute to a fixed liability, and that Congress was considering specifically making that liability retroactive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.635" offset="4393267">Therefore, against this backdrop of six years of regulation under ERISA, of 17 months of considering the Multi-Employer Act, and given what we submit was the inexorability of the legislative process by April 29th, 1980, at a point when three Congressional Committees had already approved identical legislation and a fourth Committee headed by Senator Bentsen, who took the floor and said, we need a little bit more time to approve it, given all this historical context, withdrawing employers were in a position to know at least that they could no longer shift their responsibilities to remaining employers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1127.942" offset="4646550">We suspect... We submit that the legislative history, given this legislative history, given the considerations of Congress in terms of the need to remove incentives, that this case follows a fortiori from Turner Elkhorn, where the Court sustained a wholly new and unanticipated liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1149.474" offset="4732649">From Turner Elkhorn's perspective, the transaction which generated its liability was entirely closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1158.913" offset="4770370">Indeed, as Justice Powell pointed out in his concurring opinion in Turner Elkhorn, the employment relationship in some instances in that case had ceased 50 years earlier, notwithstanding which liability was attached to Turner Elkhorn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1174.840" offset="4834109">Now, the court below rejected the Turner Elkhorn standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1179.076" offset="4851036">It relied instead on a contracts clause case, Allied Structural Steel versus Spanous, on a 1935 decision in Railroad Retirement Board versus Alton, and the latter case's continued vitality was questioned by this Court in Turner Elkhorn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.324" offset="4935987">First, with regard to Allied, if I may for a few minutes, it is clear that the contracts clause by its terms is limited to state impairment of contract, but even if the contract's clause were somehow made applicable, its principles were somehow imported into a due process analysis, as the court below has suggested, we submit that Allied is distinguishable from the case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.059" offset="5055001">The lynch pin of the Court's decision in Allied was that the Minnesota statute there created new rights where none had existed before, and in addition, in the Energy Reserves decision which came down last term, it was clear that the Court narrowed the applicability of Allied, because Allied was entering... Minnesota was entering an area it had never before sought to regulate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.730" offset="5193658">Under these circumstances and under similar circumstances described in our brief, we submit that Allied is completely distinguishable from the case at bar, and similarly, the Alton Railroad decision created a new pension scheme for railroad employees again where none had existed before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.263" offset="5279758">Here, the expectations of the receipt of vested benefits is unmistakable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.167" offset="5311418">And finally, appellees place their principal reliance on a 1928 decision in Untermeyer versus Anderson.</text>
            <text syncTime="1302.939" offset="5346527">We believe that that reliance is misplaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1306.224" offset="5359588">There, as the Court knows, the Court invalidated a retroactive gift tax, but as explained in Welch versus Henry, there was no warning that such a tax would be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.686" offset="5421446">Here, as three Courts of Appeals and as numerous District Courts have held, notice was everywhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="1622.973" offset="6626632">One was whether these trusts are free to use the money that they receive from payments on withdrawal liability for any purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.245" offset="6663725">They are indeed free to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.030" offset="6674801">In fact, it is probably part of their fiduciary responsibility to utilize them to enhance benefits as opposed to reduce withdrawal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.886" offset="6718269">Withdrawal liability is the obligation of a withdrawing employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.474" offset="6736659">The moneys that are received by the trust are intended to be earmarked for the benefit of the beneficiary, and the larger the pool of money, the greater the benefits that can be produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1664.300" offset="6791934">These trusts, particularly the one that is before the Court today, make their own determinations independent of any third party as to what level of benefits they will sustain.</text>

            <text syncTime="1903.702" offset="7749583">PBGC's basic argument in this case is that there was adequate public notice of the pendency of the Act and its possible retroactive application.</text>

            <text syncTime="2722.876" offset="11026279">In terms of this notice question, this question which I view as a question of fundamental fairness, PBGC itself acknowledged the inability of certain employers to understand the effects of this law, even though it had already been passed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2749.776" offset="11133799">In 47 FR 34662, PBGC granted a class exemption to certain employers who entered into a transaction a day or two after September 26th, and it did so because, in its words, sales had occurred at a time when parties either did not know or could not reasonably be expected to know that sales transactions could be structured in such a way as to avoid immediate withdrawal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2784.497" offset="11272770">PBGC acknowledges that the complexities of this Act were such that even for employers who withdrew after its effective date, perhaps some exceptions, are proper.</text>
            <text syncTime="2804.828" offset="11354063">Now, I have looked at the various cases that seem to control the disposition of this case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.938" offset="11410488">The Usury case is obviously a critical case in reaching a proper resolution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.109" offset="11443193">I think it is important in looking at the Usury case to bear a few salient differences in mind, because I think it bears on this fundamental fairness concept that I have been talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="2841.286" offset="11499827">Congress chose not to impose liability immediately upon employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2850.975" offset="11538592">Rather, Congress granted a two and a half year moratorium, and during that period of time the federal government, not the employer, would pay the black lung claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="2866.984" offset="11602645">Thus, the employer was given lead time after Congressional notice of liability to adjust its affairs to deal with the imposition of this liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2883.946" offset="11670563">The other thing which I think it is very important to recognize is, the employer in those cases has the right to go to hearing to contest whether the employee had in fact been harmed, whether he had black lung disease.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.280" offset="11775889">And so in that case it was incumbent in order to recover that it be demonstrated that this employee was harmed in his relationship with this employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.273" offset="11831791">Now, why do I say that is important?</text>
            <text syncTime="2927.059" offset="11842971">Because this law, this 1980 Act, does not depend upon whether the trust has been harmed by the withdrawal of an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.901" offset="11902321">In fact, it may be a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="2945.103" offset="11915174">Let me give you an example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2946.903" offset="11922383">In... Assume an employer who for five years is covered under a collective bargaining agreement, and he is required to make contributions to a trust.</text>
            <text syncTime="2959.196" offset="11971494">At the expiration of five years, his employees decertify the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2963.998" offset="11990720">Now, under that example, none of the employees would have vested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.004" offset="12018723">Ten-year vesting is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.521" offset="12024783">None of those employees are taxed upon the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2977.158" offset="12043383">And yet that employer would be required not merely to have made his five years of contributions, but a withdrawal liability payment as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2990.549" offset="12096881">And the payments are not, as counsel would suggest, so modest because they are paid over time as not to have a terrifying impact upon employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3007.361" offset="12164173">Bear in mind that this law--</text>

            <text syncTime="3010.213" offset="12175562">Mr. Triplett, let me just go back to that hypothetical example.</text>
            <text syncTime="3014.915" offset="12194370">Wouldn't that be equally unfair if it occurred a year after the statute became effective?</text>

            <text syncTime="3021.020" offset="12218821">And part of the problem of the windfall is noted in a footnote in our brief, in which we represented to this Court that two years after we withdrew, the trust had paid all of its unfunded liabilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="3046.469" offset="12320594">It had none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3047.588" offset="12325087">The trust has our money, but the trust is fully paid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3053.992" offset="12350687">Now, if indeed there is an implied condition within this statute that states that we are entitled to our money back, then the constitutional issue in this case is moot, but if indeed there is no such implied condition, it demonstrates the massive unfairness of the rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3078.440" offset="12448489">I think that in terms of dealing with the question of retroactive liability that this Court has come perilously close to adopting a contract clause type of analysis for legislation which deals with closed transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3114.363" offset="12592163">It has never held that the two are synonymous, but in attempting to distill the principles that appear to have been applied, they appear to closely parallel one another.</text>
            <text syncTime="3131.658" offset="12661335">I think that not surprising since under the contract clause what you are doing is disrupting a prior transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.316" offset="12708042">And in consequence, it would appear to me under the Fifth Amendment that the analysis with respect to closed transactions should be the same.</text>

            <text syncTime="3161.693" offset="12781498">I mean, the framers pretty well hashed this out, and they applied prohibition against impairment of contracts to the states and the denial of due process prohibition against the federal government.</text>
