            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="136107">We will hear arguments first this morning in Selective Service System against Minnesota Public Interest Research.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.487" offset="169962">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="12.808" stopTime="276.878">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="12.808" offset="187307">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, on July 2nd, 1980, President Carter, pursuant to statutory authority, reactivated a draft registration requirement for men between the ages of 18 and 26.</text>
            <text syncTime="29.769" offset="255121">After about two years, almost 7 percent of those eligible still had not complied with the registration requirement, in some cases deliberately, and in some through inadvertence.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.641" offset="298589">In 1982, sponsors in both Houses of Congress introduced as a floor amendment to the 1983 Defense Authorization Act Section 1113, which would condition eligibility for Title 4 college student aid on compliance with the applicant's draft registration obligation.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.055" offset="380300">Much of the language of the amendment, which is sometimes called the Solomon Amendment, was supplied by Secretary Bell, who worked closely with the sponsors in both Houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.362" offset="421469">After vigorous debate, it passed both Houses by overwhelming bipartisan majorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.333" offset="445397">This case is an appeal from a District Court holding that that 1982 Solomon Amendment violated two constitutional guarantees, the prohibition against bills of attainder contained in Article 1, Section 8, Section 9, and the privilege against compelled self-incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.728" offset="522928">There are two separate and independently sufficient reasons why the District Court's bill of attainder holding must be reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.667" offset="558768">The first is... this is spelled out more completely in our reply brief... that each of the appellants' contentions rests squarely on their premise that the law does not permit aid to late registrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.093" offset="612476">That is, those who register more than 30 days after their 18th birthday.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.795" offset="627209">And the second reason is that even if the Appellees were correct on the late registration issue, this statute still is not a bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.584" offset="670363">I will deal first with the late registration issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.519" offset="678096">It is beyond dispute that the Secretary of Education's regulations do provide that those who register late are eligible for aid regardless of when they register.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.010" offset="724071">There is accordingly no question that if the individual appellees in this case comply with their obligation to register, the government will give them the aid that they say they must have.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.151" offset="776629">That is what the regulations provide, and that has been the consistent practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.372" offset="797527">In providing that those who register late are eligible, the regulatory scheme in this as is in other respects is faithful to the statutory purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="174.994" offset="835980">Congress's objective in passing this statute was not to catch wrongdoers and punish them.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.917" offset="863774">It was rather to increase the number of people who are on the draft registration roles by providing both a reminder, because in many cases the reason for non-registration was simple inadvertence, and also an economic incentive.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.991" offset="919989">We turn then to the language of the statute, and there is nothing in that language that prohibits this result which the regulations provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.449" offset="957815">The statute requires registration in accordance with any proclamation, rule, or regulation, and the President's proclamation does require registration within 30 days of the registrant's 18th birthday.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.757" offset="1015075">The apparent reason for the statutory reference in the Solomon Amendment to rules, regulations, and proclamations is that Section 3 of the Civil Service Act which requires registration is not self-executing and does not come into play until there is some proclamation, rule, or regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="237.051" offset="1084247">But in any event it is far from clear that in accordance with means within the time fixed by.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.840" offset="1119460">And another part of the statute, Subsection F(4), which is really the fourth subdivision of the Solomon Amendment, supports the view that in accordance with means in the manner required by rather than within the time fixed by.</text>
            <text syncTime="259.934" offset="1175780">In any event, either explanation is plausible.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.636" offset="1190618">Certainly neither is implausible, and under those circumstances it is appropriate to consult the statutory purpose, the statutory history in determining the validity of these regulations.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="276.878" stopTime="284.199">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="276.878" offset="1243594">May I ask, Mr. Solicitor General, what is the dimensions of this problem?</text>
            <text syncTime="281.180" offset="1260731">How many have not registered who are eligible to?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="284.199" stopTime="284.599">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="284.199" offset="1272851">To date?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="284.599" stopTime="285.567">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="284.599" offset="1274419">Yes.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="285.567" stopTime="300.911">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="285.567" offset="1278285">To date.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.051" offset="1280270">As of the date of the Solomon Amendment, the legislative history sometimes says 500,000, sometimes says seven, and sometimes says eight.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.388" offset="1309632">As of last week, it was approximately half that, about 350,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.625" offset="1330530">There is little doubt--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="300.911" stopTime="303.363">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="300.911" offset="1339725">What is the total number who have registered?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="303.363" stopTime="480.744">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="303.363" offset="1349547">--I will give you some figures and you can extrapolate and I can extrapolate.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.647" offset="1370654">I think I can tell you approximately what the number is.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.449" offset="1381834">That number of somewhere between 350 and 380 represents about 3.1 percent of those who should register, whereas the earlier figure was about 7 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.324" offset="1425302">There is little doubt that the Members of the House and the Senate who enacted this law thought of the statute as designed to create an incentive to register, and that as a consequence late registrants would be eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.600" offset="1486429">The ample supports for this rather pervasive view among the Members of the House and the Senate are contained in the brief, and there are many on both sides.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.290" offset="1517253">Senator Stennis, for example, referred to some youngster who might have overlooked signing up.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.676" offset="1538778">Nevertheless, in the Senator's language, all this youngster will have to do is just to comply with the law, and that will automatically make him eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.949" offset="1579843">There are many similar statements cited in our briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.917" offset="1591754">Finally, there is the matter of the regulations themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.638" offset="1610563">This is the strongest possible case for deference to the administrative regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.642" offset="1638670">These regulations were not only adopted right after the passage of the statute, through the joint efforts of the two agencies charged with its implementation.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.065" offset="1676287">This is also literally a case where the draftsmen of the statute, or one of the draftsmen of the statute was also the draftsman of the regulations, and that person is, of course, Secretary Bell.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.674" offset="1734801">In short, every single guide to statutory construction points in the same direction, and if this statute is interpreted consistent with its purpose, its history, and it implementing regulations, then constitutional issues disappear, because neither this nor any other court has ever invalidated as a bill of attainder any statute whose applicability or non-applicability depended upon what the individual would or would not do in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.997" offset="1868025">It is at least anomalous, maybe revealing is the better word, that the appellees' argument with respect to the meaning of this statute on the late registration issue would if successful make it more difficult for them to get financial aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.125" offset="1944512">They are arguing for an interpretation of the law which actually makes it harder for them to get what they assure us that they must absolutely have.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.350" offset="1985472">This shows that their real disagreement is with the Congressional policy decisions that there should be a draft registration and that people should be encouraged to register, policy decisions which clearly fall within Congress's constitutional authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.709" offset="2050883">I turn now to our second point.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="480.744" stopTime="491.334">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="480.744" offset="2059033">Why, Mr. Solicitor General, did Congress... is there any indication in the history why did they want the registration without the actual authority to draft?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="491.334" stopTime="655.475">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="491.334" offset="2101351">That decision, of course, was made at an earlier point in time, and I guess it was made in 1980, and actually was reflected in President Carter's proclamation, but I would assume that it is simply a readiness statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.046" offset="2164254">The policymakers of our nation concluded that we are not yet at the stage that we need to move to the draft itself, but just to a readiness position in the event that the draft is necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="517.734" offset="2206990">Even if this statute could be construed to prohibit aid to late registrants, it is still not a bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.209" offset="2248891">This Court clarified in Nixon versus the Administrator that to qualify as a bill of attainder a statute must meet each of three tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.731" offset="2282954">Namely, it must apply only to a specific individual or group.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.200" offset="2300822">Second, it must inflict punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="544.485" offset="2313988">And third, it must deny judicial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.254" offset="2325064">This statute does not one of those three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.990" offset="2340006">First, the Solomon Amendment simply is not punitive within the bill of attainder sense of that word.</text>
            <text syncTime="560.946" offset="2379816">At common law, bills of attainder were legislative death sentences, usually for treason, but it is clear that Article 1, Section 9, also includes common law bills of pains and penalties, which included such penalties as imprisonment, banishment, and confiscation of property, and as the Court pointed out in Nixon versus Administrator, our own American experience has added one other category, and that is disqualification from certain kinds of employment because of a legislative determination of past wrongdoing by particular individuals or groups.</text>
            <text syncTime="598.055" offset="2528296">But punishment for bill of attainder purposes clearly does not extend to any circumstance of non-realization of an economic benefit which any individual would like to have, and the square holding of Fleming versus Nestor is that the mere denial, in Fleming's words, the mere denial of a non-contractual governmental benefit does not amount to punishment for bill of attainder purposes, and that is all we have here, the mere denial of a non-contractual governmental benefit.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.776" offset="2667163">If it was not punishment to deprive Mr. Nestor of his Social Security benefits after he had paid into the fund for 19 years, then a fortiori it is not punishment to condition student aid to registration with the draft.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="655.475" stopTime="664.664">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="655.475" offset="2757965">Do we know, Mr. Solicitor General, how many of that 350 to 380,000 who have not registered are receiving financial aid?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="664.664" stopTime="666.283">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="664.664" offset="2794745">We do not.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="666.283" stopTime="667.150">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="666.283" offset="2801224">Or are asking for it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="667.150" stopTime="1049.014">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="667.150" offset="2804672">We do not.</text>
            <text syncTime="667.750" offset="2807075">There is no way, I guess, that the government would have access to that kind of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="671.585" offset="2822435">I turn now to the other two elements of bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.805" offset="2839258">With regard to specificity, this law applies to non-registrants.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.892" offset="2867575">It is the complete antithesis, the complete opposite end of the spectrum from the specific identification that we experienced at common law or any other instance in which any statute has ever been held unconstitutional as a bill of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.373" offset="2949599">It is an open-ended group whose fluctuating membership will be determined by events which are yet to occur in the future, and that argument does not depend on our position with regard to late registration, because even if we are wrong on late registration, the class affected is nonetheless one that changes every day and whose composition is constantly subject to future contingencies as more young men turn 18 and either register or neglect or decline to register.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.879" offset="3083555">And as I stated a moment ago, never in the history of our Republic has any statute ever been held unconstitutional as a bill of attainder where its membership depended upon events which might yet occur in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.972" offset="3143950">With regard to denial of judicial process, the only relevant issue or determination through the judicial type process, whether the individual does or does not fall within the legislative target area, is whether the individual has registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="770.350" offset="3217407">It is therefore completely unlike the circumstance in United States versus Brown, in which the issue was whether communism was an adequate proxy for... to engage in political strikes.</text>
            <text syncTime="784.693" offset="3274876">And since this statute and these regulations do provide for the individual who wants to show that in fact he has registered, this characteristic, this factor also has been satisfied.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.452" offset="3333913">I turn finally to the appellees' privilege against self-incrimination argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="805.273" offset="3357109">There are three short reasons why this is not a violation of the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.944" offset="3387829">The first is that there is no compulsion.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.296" offset="3397234">There is no compulsion in prescribing standards of eligibility for student aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.616" offset="3418549">Indeed, non-registrants are not only not compelled to apply for student aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.520" offset="3442164">It would be useless for them to do so because they are ineligible, and it is not a crime not to apply for student aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.975" offset="3475914">Moreover, the privilege against self-incrimination does not assure that there will be no adverse economic consequences from remaining silent.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.963" offset="3507888">The Garrity, Spevack, Gardner, Lefkowitz line of cases on which the appellees rely stand for the proposition that government may not compel self-incrimination, may not compel self-incriminating testimony without a grant of immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="859.241" offset="3572985">They do not stand for the proposition, as this Court made very clear in the Gardner case, that nothing that the person says or doesn't say can ever be used to his economic advantage, or disadvantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="872.751" offset="3627111">Surely, for example, the Drug Enforcement Administration is entitled to ask a job applicant whether he uses drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.571" offset="3654383">Surely in employing lawyers from my office we are entitled to ask whether the applicant has ever stolen money from a client.</text>
            <text syncTime="888.094" offset="3688447">Surely the Department of Agriculture is entitled to ask an applicant for federal crop insurance whether he is growing marijuana on his farm.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.366" offset="3721570">And in the administration of Title 4 itself, surely the Department of Education can ask whether the applicant is legally in this country, because that is one of the qualifications for student aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.091" offset="3772456">Third, there is an element of unreality about the appellees' Fifth Amendment argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="916.863" offset="3803490">The purpose of this statute after all is to get people registered.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.231" offset="3820940">A major objective, a major theme in the legislative history is that those people who had not registered on time should register late, and that was a major purpose of this statute, to get those who had not registered on time to register late.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.825" offset="3875379">It would be a perversion of that purpose to prosecute late registrants, to prosecute for doing the very thing that the statute was passed to encourage, and it has never been done.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.383" offset="3921563">This Court said in Marketti that the central standard for the privileges application has been whether the claimant is confronted by substantial and real as opposed to mere trifling or imaginary hazards of incrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.856" offset="3971509">I cannot imagine any hazards of incrimination that more appropriately fit that definition, trifling and imaginary.</text>

I get the two of them confused... either one of them, that if a physician was seeking to participate, that is, to charge fees, that he would have to certify under oath that he had repaid any student loan that he may have had to get his medical education.</text>

            <text syncTime="1195.428" offset="4917769">Non-registration, on the other hand, is a crime punishable by imprisonment by up to five years and a fine of $10,000 or both, and so the difference between many of those kinds of conditions if they are bona fide and rationally related to the goal of the Congress is a different thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.591" offset="5002406">In addition, if the underlying act is a criminal act in itself, that carries us one further away from the case here.</text>

            <text syncTime="1232.017" offset="5064159">If Section 1113 survives scrutiny, it will be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.171" offset="5084744">Indeed, it has already been followed by a rash of similar laws by which government on all levels, federal, state, and local, will demand citizens to swear or certify under pain of perjury in return for some form of government benefit that they have not broken one law or another.</text>
            <text syncTime="1256.716" offset="5162902">These laws not only undercut the judicial system, but they serve as an affront to the dignity and the integrity of our citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.036" offset="5196234">Fortunately the Constitution, through its bill of attainder clause, through the proscription on self-incrimination, and through its guarantee of equal protection, does not tolerate laws such as 1113.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.813" offset="5247330">Section 1113 violates the prohibition against bills of attainder.</text>
            <text syncTime="1282.582" offset="5266347">It targets a clearly identifiable group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1286.116" offset="5280558">It imposes punishment, and it does so without the protections of a judicial trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.020" offset="5304172">Section 1113 accomplishes this, as I mentioned, through the device of a test oath by which the applicant for aid must certify under pain of perjury that he has complied, he has submitted to registration under Section 3 of the Selective Service Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1309.149" offset="5372613">And in addition, as is true of the classic test oath cases, the conduct here is perceived by some to be disloyal or at least politically unpopular.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.873" offset="5411588">In spite of the government's protestations, there can be no doubt that all three of the elements or requirements to proscribe the statute as a bill of attainder are met here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.228" offset="5452966">This statute clearly focuses on non-registrant students who need financial aid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.418" offset="5481700">In Footnote 29 of the Brown case, the Court said that as long as you can ascertain a group that is the focus of a statute... in that case they cited, for example, a statute with regard to operating machinery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.492" offset="5538020">If you can describe symptoms, or if you can describe a disease, or some other guideline by which the group could be ascertained, that is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.915" offset="5571666">Here, the statute itself identifies a group, and there is no question but that who is within its proscription.</text>

            <text syncTime="1397.873" offset="5727565">In addition, anywhere, depending on the program, from two-thirds to three-quarters of the students fall within families who have total family income of $18,000 or less, which is considerably less than the average family income for the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.405" offset="5813665">And so, while we can't define exactly the numbers who would fall within it, we can see that it is a high percentage of students and the funds available to students generally are overwhelmingly the federally financed funds under Title 4.</text>

            <text syncTime="1499.940" offset="6135807">Footnote 32 in the Brown case makes it clear that this is not a prerequisite to finding an ascertainable or identifiable group.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.130" offset="6172587">It is merely one factor that might be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.682" offset="6186798">But in this case the government agrees that the act of non-registration is complete upon the expiration of a 30-day period after attaining one's 18th birthday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.473" offset="6233923">Now, whether they forebear from prosecuting or not is not the point, but the past and ineradicable act exists upon the expiration of that time period, and so any of these people could be prosecuted at any time if the government changed its policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.101" offset="6296407">And during the late sixties and the early seventies, the government did in fact prosecute late registrants, so I think we can see that this is an identifiable group.</text>
