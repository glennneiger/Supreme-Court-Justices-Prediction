            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="133142">We'll hear arguments first this morning in United States against Weber Aircraft Corporation.</text>

            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="12.609" offset="183506">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="22.736" offset="224048">This case concerns the continued existence of an important part of the Armed Forces program of aviation safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.981" offset="256962">Specifically, the issue is whether statements made in confidence to military aviation safety investigators must be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, even though those statements would be privileged in civil discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.162" offset="317775">When an Air Force plane is involved in an accident, two separate investigations are generally conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.966" offset="348913">The first is called a safety investigation and, as the name implies, its sole purpose is to prevent future accidents.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.541" offset="383291">Witnesses are advised that their statements will be used exclusively for purposes of safety and will be kept confidential.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.236" offset="418086">In addition, Air Force members and employees are assured by regulation that their statements will not be used against them in administrative or disciplinary proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.764" offset="464166">Under present practice, the safety investigation compiles a two-part report.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.719" offset="483914">The first part contains facts except for those facts derived from confidential statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.974" offset="508992">This part of the report is disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.285" offset="526233">The second part contains confidential statements as well as the findings, analysis and recommendations of the safety investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.891" offset="564685">This part is not disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.042" offset="573253">Within the Air Force, the safety report is used, of course, for safety purposes and is distributed strictly on a need to know basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.818" offset="608362">In addition, to the extent practicable all identifying details are removed.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.073" offset="633335">At the same time, a second, separate investigation is also conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.656" offset="655695">This is now called an accident investigation, but at the time in question here was termed a collateral investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.052" offset="685266">Its purpose is to collect and preserve evidence for all purposes other than safety, for use in court-martial and administrative and judicial proceedings, in litigation and other purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.139" offset="737615">Statements given by witnesses to the first investigation, to the safety investigation, are not disclosed to the accident investigation, but a list of the witnesses is provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.506" offset="783069">Therefore, the second, accident investigation will generally interview the same witnesses and is required to do so by regulation as soon as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.063" offset="821312">This entire report is disclosed to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="176.397" offset="838657">The other military services follow similar procedures.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.229" offset="857988">For more than 20 years now since the D.C. Circuit's decision in Machin versus Zucker, statements made in confidence to military aviation safety investigators have been privileged in civil discovery, and Respondents have not challenged the validity or scope of that civil discovery privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.663" offset="935728">In hundreds of cases, Air Force safety--</text>

            <text syncTime="242.248" offset="1102076">But the issue decided by the Court of Appeals and that we brought here was whether these statements would be subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act, assuming that they would be privileged in civil discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.819" offset="1156411">Since the recognition of this privilege in the Machin decision, Air Force safety investigators in hundreds of cases have compared the statements made by the same witnesses regarding the same accidents to these two separate investigations and, not surprisingly, this comparison has disclosed, human nature being what it is, that the statements made to the safety board, which are made under promises of confidentiality, frequently contain valuable information that is not disclosed to the accident board.</text>

            <text syncTime="333.200" offset="1465909">I think that's human nature.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.690" offset="1471865">People will protect themselves when there's a possibility that their statements may be used against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="340.994" offset="1497047">When they are supplying information solely for the purpose of preventing injury to their colleagues, they will be more forthcoming if they are protected against any possible use of those statements against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.562" offset="1551382">Perhaps it's unfortunate, but I think that that is a well recognized fact of human nature.</text>

          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="367.531" stopTime="416.743">
            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="367.531" offset="1603209">I think that's unlikely, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.574" offset="1615434">Both boards are composed of experienced rated officers and commanders are required by regulation to make all necessary technical expertise available to both boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.553" offset="1675307">So I think there is no basis for concluding that the questions asked by the first board are better than the questions asked by the second board.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.659" offset="1711774">And in addition, since the safety investigation precedes the accident investigation, if the safety investigator happened to ask a particularly... excuse me... the safety investigation happened to ask a particularly good question and the witness remembered it, he might well volunteer that information when he was questioned later by the accident board.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="416.743" stopTime="426.430">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="416.743" offset="1800068">Mr. Alito, does the record show that these witnesses whose statements are being withheld actually were promised confidentiality?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="426.430" stopTime="704.862">
            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="426.430" offset="1838833">I believe it does, Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.680" offset="1847820">I think that both of the lower courts found that confidentiality had been offered.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.244" offset="1866105">I don't believe that Respondents raised that issue below, but if they did raise it I think it was rejected by both of the lower courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.301" offset="1902259">In any event, there was an uncontroverted affidavit filed in district court, which is reproduced in our joint appendix, in which the responsible Air Force official claims that these statements had been obtained under pledges of confidentiality, and as far as I am aware there has been no factual refutation of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.715" offset="1991911">In any event, that was certainly not the basis for the Court of Appeals' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.919" offset="2008734">The Court of Appeals' decision was certainly based on the presumption that these were confidential witness statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.841" offset="2036424">The information that is contained in these confidential statements has contributed to a dramatic improvement in military aviation safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.668" offset="2075712">It is really no exaggeration to say that in many instances it has saved lives, it has prevented the loss of valuable aircraft, and it has contributed to the national defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.466" offset="2122941">Now, in the present case an Air Force officer, Captain Richard Hoover, was seriously injured when he ejected from his plane.</text>
            <text syncTime="505.370" offset="2154602">He sued Respondents, who are the manufacturers and designers of some of the ejection equipment, and they then sought release of the Air Force reports.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.477" offset="2190964">The Air Force disclosed the entire accident report and the factual portions of the safety report, but under the Machin privilege withheld the confidential witness statements.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.305" offset="2238298">Respondents then filed Freedom of Information Act requests and ultimately brought suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.457" offset="2258882">The district court upheld the Air Force under exemption 5, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.361" offset="2282497">Assuming that the statements would be privileged in civil discovery, the court nevertheless concluded that exemption 5 did not incorporate the Machin privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.679" offset="2323771">As I said, then, the issue before the Court is whether these confidential statements must be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, assuming that they would be privileged in civil discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.645" offset="2367656">But it's important to recognize that if statements of this sort are available under the Freedom of Information Act, then the civil discovery privilege is effectively abolished because litigants like Respondents will always be able to get those statements under FCIA.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.657" offset="2439754">Let me stress at the outset that protecting documents like this would not in any way undermine the purpose of the Freedom of Information Act, because at least from a perspective looking forward the issue in this case, unlike some Freedom of Information Act cases, is not whether a certain type of information will or will not be available to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.114" offset="2537557">We are talking here about a kind of information that witnesses simply will not divulge unless confidentiality is assured, and this is demonstrated by the Air Force parallel investigation with almost scientific precision.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.715" offset="2599937">The accident investigation serves as a sort of control group.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.027" offset="2617178">As I said, a witness to an Air Force accident is generally questioned twice, first by the safety board and then by the accident board.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.253" offset="2654063">The safety board promises confidentiality; the accident board does not.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.995" offset="2673080">If the safety board could not make those promises of confidentiality, then the statements they receive would be essentially the same as the statements already received by the accident board and already available to the public, and therefore the public would not have any more information than it has at present, but those responsible for military aviation safety would have significantly less.</text>
            <text syncTime="659.572" offset="2771405">In our view, neither the language of the Freedom of Information Act nor the statute nor the legislative history supports this senseless result.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.449" offset="2814873">First, the statutory language.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.079" offset="2825426">Exemption 5, of course, protects inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="687.819" offset="2884358">And what this means, as the Court has explained on a number of occasions, is that exemption 5 protects those documents normally privileged in civil discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="698.026" offset="2925214">Here, as I stated, the Court of Appeals correctly assumed that these statements would be privileged in civil litigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="709.104" offset="2969518">The safety investigation... well, let me qualify that, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.576" offset="2983415">The two investigations take place at essentially the same time, but the safety investigation has priority in examining witnesses and in examining tangible evidence.</text>

            <text syncTime="723.863" offset="3028554">It would seem to me... I'm just thinking out loud... that in response to your argument that the net result will be the same if you cut out the confidential investigation, that you'd get the other anyway, isn't it conceivable that the second investigation might omit some areas of questioning that they explored in the first, that they might not have if they just were starting from scratch?</text>

            <text syncTime="743.886" offset="3108593">I don't see that there's any reason to believe that the questioning in the second investigation will be appreciably different from the first.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.522" offset="3147150">The second... the interviews by the accident board, as I said, are required by regulation to take place as soon as possible after the witnesses are released by the safety investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.231" offset="3189991">And I am informed that in appropriate cases witnesses have even been permitted to refresh their recollection by reviewing their statements to the safety investigation before they testify to the accident board.</text>
            <text syncTime="776.978" offset="3240982">So, while of course it's always possible that two questioners will not ask the same questions and that one will omit an important question asked by the other, I don't think there's any reason to believe that that will occur in many instances under this setup.</text>

            <text syncTime="937.366" offset="3882549">Instead, they look past the statutory language to the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.899" offset="3904701">That is the heart of their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.539" offset="3911284">And yet what is curious is that even there they do not find any positive support for their argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="951.295" offset="3938242">On the contrary, all the evidence in the legislative history indicates that Congress meant what it said when it enacted exemption 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="959.309" offset="3970321">Both the House and the Senate reports state that the purpose of exemption 5 was to protect those documents normally privileged in civil discovery, and of course as I said the statements here were assumed to fall into that category.</text>
            <text syncTime="974.559" offset="4031343">Now, it's true that both reports specifically mention a couple of exemptions, but there is absolutely no reason to believe that those passing references were intended to constitute an exhaustive list of the incorporated privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.879" offset="4092574">In addition to all of this, there is even specific evidence in the legislative history that Congress focused on the desirability of protecting the very type of statements involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1004.199" offset="4149834">When the hearings were held on exemption 5, that provision would not have protected statements of this sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="1012.353" offset="4182540">It was limited to documents dealing solely with matters of law or policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.698" offset="4203855">At the Congressional hearings a number of witnesses pointed out that these statements were then privileged in civil discovery and should not have to be disclosed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.564" offset="4243353">Congress thereafter amended exemption 5 to protect those documents not routinely disclosed in civil litigation, and Congress accomplished this by recasting exemption 5 in language similar to exemption 7 as it was then framed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.176" offset="4313779">Respondents argue that these statements must nevertheless be disclosed because these facts do not conclusively establish that Congress had the Machin privilege specifically in mind when it amended exemption 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1060.676" offset="4375846">But this argument really turns the usual rules of statutory interpretation upside-down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.121" offset="4401550">Respondents are arguing that exemption 5 must be construed in a way that is contrary to the legislative history, not because there is positive evidence supporting their interpretation in the legislative history... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.821" offset="4464349">They are arguing that exemption 5 must be construed in a way that is flatly contrary to the statutory language, and they make the argument not because there is positive evidence supporting that interpretation in the legislative history, but because in their view the legislative history fails to show with sufficient clarity that Congress meant what it said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.206" offset="4557867">This is really one of the oddest methods of statutory construction ever advanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.060" offset="4581377">The basis for this method of statutory construction is dictum in this Court's decision in Merroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.274" offset="4610216">But neither the Merroll dictum nor the holding in that case supports their conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.358" offset="4634562">In Merroll the Court noted that it is not clear that exemption 5 incorporates every known civil discovery privilege, and the Court also observed that any claim that a privilege other than the two specifically noted in the legislative history was incorporated into exemption 5 would have to be viewed with caution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.361" offset="4714497">The apparent basis for this observation as we read the opinion was the recognition that with certain civil discovery privileges in other exemptions and may have intended to modify their scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.672" offset="4771758">But here the Machin privilege does not substantially duplicate any other FOIA exemption, and I think that it is unreasonable to read the caution prescribed by Merroll as requiring that exemption 5 be construed in a way that is contrary both to the statutory language and to all of the affirmative evidence in the legislative history.</text>

            <text syncTime="1223.092" offset="5025459">The references by the Justice Department did not mention any specific privilege as I recall, any specific exemption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.288" offset="5054193">The references by the Defense Department did refer to exemption 7, but I think that that actually supports our argument because, as I noted, Congress amended exemption 5 by recasting it in language similar to exemption 7 as it was then framed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.008" offset="5129113">At the time of the hearings, both exemptions 5 and 7 read very differently than they do now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1255.072" offset="5153354">As I said, exemption 5 applied to documents</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.005" offset="5169132">"dealing solely with matters of law or policy. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.909" offset="5184701">and exemption 7 concerned documents compiled for law enforcement purposes, except to the extent available by law to a private party.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.585" offset="5227438">What Congress did was to amend exemption 5 to protect documents that would not be available by law to a private party in litigation with the agency, which is language very similar to the language in exemption 5, as Justice Powell observed in his opinion in the Robbins Tire &amp; Rubber case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1295.648" offset="5315731">So I think that if anything the Defense Department's references to exemption 5 tend to show that Congress was listening carefully to what the Defense Department recommendation was.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.448" offset="5366931">But our essential argument is that the protection of these privileges follows from the statutory language, and since there is... whatever else one may say about the legislative history, it certainly does not clearly show that Congress had a contrary intent, and therefore the statutory language controls.</text>

            <text syncTime="1363.947" offset="5588868">It protects documents that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with an agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.042" offset="5621260">Weber Aircraft Corporation and the other Respondents are parties other than an agency.</text>

            <text syncTime="1448.311" offset="5926370">In Machin or Machin, the Air Force mechanics were people who examined the wreckage after the accident took place, and what they discovered was in the nature of the facts that would now be placed in part one of the safety report.</text>

            <text syncTime="1502.818" offset="6144335">In conclusion, the statements involved here fall within the plain language of exemption 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1511.353" offset="6178504">Everything in the legislative history indicates that Congress intended to protect documents of this sort, and requiring the disclosure of statements like this would not serve the purposes of FOIA because it would not make any more information available to the public or to the press than is available already.</text>

            <text syncTime="1883.957" offset="7668946">There is tremendous legislative history, Mr. Chief Justice, which reflects not only with respect to number 5, but with respect to exemptions 7 and 3, that Congress very specifically gave us legislative history to indicate to us that they had no intention of incorporating this Machin decision in exemption 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.859" offset="7748567">Just a last word on Merroll.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.754" offset="7768107">Our understanding of the Merroll decision is the Court, after making a review of the legislative history, both houses, found support in that legislative history for the qualified commercial information privilege which the Court found in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.922" offset="7832786">And analysis of the privilege, or any other privilege, as the Court said, must be viewed with caution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.349" offset="7870507">If it's a privilege other than those recognized in the legislative history which the Court reviewed, we ought to look at it with caution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.414" offset="7902794">And it's the Respondent's position that the caution ought to become in the nature of a red alert when the privilege which is being offered for consideration is one based on an efficiency of the agency, public interest standard, which is the identical standard that was swept away by the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1964.417" offset="7990775">We believe that the privilege here is a pre... that is, Machin... is a pre-FOIA privilege for non-Government witness statements, announced in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="1979.320" offset="8050334">And a review of the Machin rationale for that decision indicates that it is absolutely counter and directly contrary to the Freedom of Information Act and the cases of this Court which interpreted that Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.089" offset="8109475">So Merroll says to us, let us look at the legislative history and what does it tell us specifically about the exemption at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2003.663" offset="8147718">It is our position that exemption 5 has nothing to do with Machin, never did, neither in its original form nor in its amended form, as the Solicitor General's Office points out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.423" offset="8206755">However, we disagree.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.715" offset="8211980">We certainly concede it was amended, but it was amended, we believe, because it had to deal with the question of should the agency disclose or withhold documents not purely law or policy, but those which contained mix documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2035.517" offset="8275196">That is the reason in our view for the amendment of exemption 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.256" offset="8286063">It had nothing to do with Machin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.590" offset="8295467">A review of the legislative history for exemption 5 will reveal, we believe, no member of Congress ever referred to a Machin privilege nor was it suggested, nor indeed under exemption 5 did the Government ever even assert that it ought to be included.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.870" offset="8364535">Congress specifically refused to attach any viability to the Machin privilege in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2066.686" offset="8399852">During the Senate hearings both the Department of Defense and the Justice Department specifically asked Congress to give them relief and to give them under amendment 7 the governmental investigation exemption, a Machin privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.166" offset="8461710">And during those hearings they argued before the Congress that there wasn't a provision protecting the material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.039" offset="8489295">What material?</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.270" offset="8494206">The Machin-type privilege aircraft accident material in the context of exemption 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2096.275" offset="8518239">They specifically requested that relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2099.096" offset="8529524">In addition, in addition to the testimony before both houses of Congress, there were written comments which were sent to the House and the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.521" offset="8555124">The Departments of Defense and Justice asked for the Machin privilege to be incorporated into 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.675" offset="8583754">Congress refused and left exemption 7 exactly the way it was, and refused to provide to them the specific protection that they asked for, and they left it only for the investigation files and confidential material for law enforcement purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.556" offset="8655330">The Government suggests in its brief that Machin was discussed during discussions concerning amendment 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2138.902" offset="8688662">We pointed out in our brief that we believe that position to be in error and the legislative history in our belief indicated that it was 7 to which these discussions were concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.499" offset="8727114">The Government's reply brief makes a curious point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2152.993" offset="8745086">It appears to admit that the discussions took place with respect to 7, but nonetheless suggested that Congress must have amended number 5 to reflect the Government concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.150" offset="8789704">I just don't think that there's any support whatsoever in the legislative history for that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.203" offset="8813945">And we don't only have to look to see that the Government refused to amend exemption 7 to give the Government... Congress to amend exemption 7, to give the Government that which they're seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2183.441" offset="8866817">In addition to going to Congress to exempt these materials under 7, the Government has gone to Congress twice and requested specific legislation pursuant to exemption 3, which allows the Government to withhold material if there is a specific statute authorizing the withholding; has gone to Congress and twice requested specific authorization, both in 1980 and 1983, and requested that there be statutory language passed allowing a Machin-type privilege so that the material such as at issue in this case could be withheld.</text>
            <text syncTime="2222.167" offset="9021775">In 1980 the Department of Defense sent a request for legislation and draft legislation to the Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.334" offset="9054376">It was never acted on by either house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2232.324" offset="9062422">In 1983 the Executive Branch sent to the Senate proposed legislation which found its way into the defense authorization bill without debate, but when the House and Senate Conference Committee got together the matter was struck out in its entirety and deleted and sent back for further study.</text>
            <text syncTime="2251.075" offset="9137341">The legislative history reflecting that further study is reportable to the Congress on January 15th of 1984.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.822" offset="9172345">That, we believe, is the legislative history review that the court engaged in in the Merroll case in order to determine whether or not the materials were available by law to a party in litigation with the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.373" offset="9238592">There isn't any legislative history to support whatever that the 1963 opinion of Circuit Judge Washington was intended to be incorporated in exemption 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.303" offset="9290314">The legislative history we believe is quite to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.027" offset="9313198">We note in footnote 2 of the Merroll decision Justice Stevens pointed out that it was indeed curious that the agency there before the Court sought relief under exemption 4 and was turned down, and the Court in its majority opinion found that relief appearing in exemption 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.061" offset="9401282">We have a very similar situation in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2321.032" offset="9417269">Justice and the Department of Defense have gone to Congress under two other exemptions and tried to get the protection which they know in our view is not available to them under number 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.360" offset="9458543">So in addition to the legislative history, which we think is clear that there just wasn't any intent, it's not one of the enunciated privileges of attorney-client, work product, the executive predecisional privilege, or the qualified confidential commercial privilege which the Court found in Merroll from a review of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.733" offset="9540045">In addition, there are some analogous materials which I think are helpful in determining, did the Court intend a Machin-type discovery to be included.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.320" offset="9578393">The Court will recall that after its decision in FAA versus Robertson the Congress reversed that particular case specifically, and what was really at issue here, the identical type of aircraft investigation materials that are available in this case, only under the cognizance of the Federal Aircraft Administration, the identical type material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.416" offset="9678703">And the Court... and the Congress in short order reversed that particular holding of the Court, although it was an exemption 3 case, and said that it would not permit the Federal Aircraft Administration to withhold aircraft safety information because it felt it was in the efficient interest of the agency and was in the public interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="2450.219" offset="9933971">In addition to the FAA versus Robertson situation, Congress has made other clear indications of its intent, and it mandated the National Transportation Safety Board in the Independent Safety Board Act to direct that the information be released, the identical type of information that the Air Force seeks to withhold in this case, information which concerns itself with safety and safety investigations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2480.547" offset="10055284">We think that the legislative history review which is called for in Merroll and which I believe is a cornerstone of the Ninth Circuit Court opinion in this case, a review of that legislative history will indicate that there isn't any support for the idea that a Machin-type privilege is one which ought to be included into exemption 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.123" offset="10153609">Indeed, a review of the legislative history of the other exemptions in which the Government has sought protection indicates quite to the contrary.</text>

            <text syncTime="2527.507" offset="10243157">First, as a factual matter I think it is not true, as Respondents state, that the issue of the life sciences report is before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2536.265" offset="10278161">We specifically did not petition on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2539.135" offset="10289655">That is at page 8, footnote 9, of our petition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2542.747" offset="10304074">Second and much more importantly, Respondents concede that for purposes of this argument the statements at issue would be privileged in civil discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2554.227" offset="10350050">Yet they nevertheless argue that these documents must be turned over to them under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2560.569" offset="10375336">We fail to see what possible sense this argument makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.191" offset="10389860">They are themselves litigants in a suit and they are seeking these documents for purposes of discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.438" offset="10418804">It just doesn't make any sense for documents to be privileged in civil discovery, yet available to litigants under the Freedom of Information Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2581.004" offset="10457152">I think in argument Respondents have again reiterated this very odd method of statutory construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.859" offset="10488499">Without making any serious effort to reconcile their interpretation with the statutory language, they argue that the statements must nevertheless be turned over because the legislative history in their view fails to show with sufficient clarity that Congress meant what it said in exemption 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.812" offset="10572300">This is not the way statutes are usually constructed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2612.664" offset="10583793">And finally, I think it makes no sense to argue that the Defense Department requests for clarifying legislation in this area have elicited any Congressional skepticism about the validity of the Machin privilege.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.454" offset="10642935">In the Ninety-Sixth Congress, with only a one-day hearing the House Committee reported cut favorably a measure much broader than the issue, the question at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.583" offset="10691418">But unfortunately that measure died because the term of Congress expired shortly thereafter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2645.156" offset="10713674">In the present Congress the Senate, without conducting any hearings, passed the measure that would have provided equivalent relief, but no such provision was contained in the House bill and the conferees deferred passage pending the submission of some explanatory material.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.146" offset="10781697">Certainly, I think one cannot read any Congressional skepticism about the need for protecting these statements into those actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.212" offset="10817955">And I think it is also well settled that an agency's requests for clarifying legislation should not elicit adverse inferences, for otherwise agencies would hesitate to do that and the task of clarifying statutory ambiguities would rest even more heavily on the Judiciary than it does at present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2693.027" offset="10905204">Thank you.</text>
