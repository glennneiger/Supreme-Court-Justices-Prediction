            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="158421">We will hear arguments first this morning in National Collegiate Athletic Association against the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.272" offset="203456">Mr. Easterbrook, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="15.426" offset="220070">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.378" offset="231877">The questions in this case concern the application of the Sherman Act to the NCAA's arrangements for the telecasting of college football.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.567" offset="268658">Two agreements are at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="30.035" offset="278480">One is the TV plan adopted by the NCAA's members and the other is a series of contracts signed between the NCAA and the ABC, CBS and Turner television networks.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.862" offset="337830">These agreements collectively govern the TV appearances of college football teams.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.064" offset="358623">They give ABC and CBS the right to broadcast football in 14 time slots each fall, or roughly one slot per network per Saturday.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.323" offset="407629">They require each network to broadcast a total of 35 different games each fall, and they require each network to broadcast the games of at least 82 different teams, different colleges, over a period of any two years.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.016" offset="470428">Colleges may telecast games outside the network contracts only in compliance with a series of rules called the exceptions rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.022" offset="506477">Although the exceptions rules have permitted the telecast of more than 100 games a year in recent years, they reduce the number of stations that can carry each game and they restrict the ability of colleges to broadcast their games when other nearby schools have not sold out their stadiums.</text>
            <text syncTime="105.900" offset="581918">The decisions of the lower courts rest on two principal bases.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.321" offset="599681">First they held these agreements are unlawful per se because they are horizontal arrangements among competitors, the colleges, to reduce the output, that is the number of different games shown on TV.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.647" offset="656942">Second, the courts held they're unlawful under the rule of reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.849" offset="673765">The Tenth Circuit thought that the plan violated the rule of reason because only large networks would be able to bid for these contracts and that created objectionable foreclosure of broadcasting by competing TV stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.310" offset="739593">As the case comes here there are seven issues before the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.279" offset="759446">Our petition presents four questions: questions concerning the scope of the per se rule, the allocation of the burden of persuasion, the existence of market power, and the application of the rule of reason if the Court funds market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.391" offset="823917">Respondents have invoked two different grounds in support of their judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="171.795" offset="845546">They have argued that the arrangements are unlawful per se as boycotts and as monopolization.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.616" offset="872818">And the Solicitor General has added still a seventh issue to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.901" offset="889954">The Solicitor General argues that the Court should replace the traditional dichotomy between per se analysis and rule of reason analysis with a new three-tier analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.791" offset="933526">Seven issues is obviously too many to handle in this oral argument, and I therefore want to address the third question presented in our petition, market power, and to discuss the other questions only as time permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.551" offset="992563">I want to focus on market power because it's the centerpiece of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.372" offset="1011894">We have argued that the rule of reason rather than the per se rule applies because the agreements are useful in helping the NCAA and its members compete against other forms of entertainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.648" offset="1068945">What you think of that argument will depend on what you think of our market power argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.368" offset="1091828">If you agree with us about the nature of competition in this market, it follows not only that the NCAA has no market power, but that the arrangements are pro-competitive tools that help to compete against other forms of entertainment.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="248.045" offset="1150552">Mr. Easterbrook, is the NCAA a for-profit association or a non-profit?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_h_easterbrook" startTime="253.097" stopTime="254.949">
            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="253.097" offset="1170718">It is a non-profit association, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="254.949" stopTime="257.484">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="254.949" offset="1178137">And are the universities that are members of it non-profit?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_h_easterbrook" startTime="257.484" stopTime="493.388">
            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="257.484" offset="1188272">They are.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.284" offset="1191512">If the Court doesn't agree with our contentions on market power, though, we have I think an uphill fight on the per se issues, because most of our arguments about how these arrangements help the NCAA's members to compete depend on our characterization of what the market is.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.731" offset="1277298">Market power is also the principal thing separating us from the Solicitor General in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.135" offset="1298927">The Solicitor General joins us in arguing that the per se rule is inapplicable here because the NCAA's arrangements are potentially pro-competitive.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.657" offset="1336961">The Solicitor General then calls for a novel intermediate tier of scrutiny under which the Court takes a quick look at the practices in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.465" offset="1376250">We are perfectly willing to agree with the Solicitor General's approach, but only if the quick look starts with a look at market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.802" offset="1405611">Market power is essential in our view because otherwise the courts end up condemning whatever they do not fully understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="320.908" offset="1441974">Here the lower courts didn't reject our justifications for this conduct so much as to say that they were not persuaded, that the NCAA's contentions were too speculative, too open-ended, too uncertain to show the necessity of this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.120" offset="1510832">Now, we think it's natural for a judge who's a novice in both economics and the football business to be hesitant about embracing a novel explanation for why the NCAA has done what it's done.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.510" offset="1560361">But antitrust is not opposed to all complicated practices just because it's hard to understand them or hard to articulate why those practices are carried out.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.818" offset="1605605">After all, if they're banned that kind of proof will never be available.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.670" offset="1621069">The market power test for which we argue is we think an absolutely essential filter.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.574" offset="1644684">If there's no market power the practices can't be anticompetitive, and indeed it's precisely the case when there is no market power that cooperative practices are likely to be most useful as instruments of competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.251" offset="1699332">We think that when a court says that it doesn't really know why a business practice was undertaken, the court should be very slow to hold that business practice unlawful if there is no market power, and that it's appropriate to put the plaintiff to one of two burdens.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.145" offset="1774983">On the one hand, the plaintiff could show that the practices are never beneficial, and in that event the per se rule applies and market power is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="413.270" offset="1811450">But if the practices have potentially pro-competitive effects, the rule of reason should apply and market power should be the initial test before a court can hold those practices unlawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.642" offset="1856903">Let me then summarize our argument on market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.779" offset="1873517">It's this: Market power under this Court's cases is the ability to raise price by reducing output.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.849" offset="1901729">That is, we want to know if the defendant has the ability to charge a monopoly price.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.337" offset="1923672">If it can't, there's no antitrust reason to be concerned about its practices.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.074" offset="1946659">And there is no way the NCAA can charge a monopoly price by reducing the number of different games that appear on TV.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.947" offset="1982186">The television industry sells viewers to advertisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.334" offset="2007681">That is the central commercial transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.286" offset="2019489">The only people who put money into this system are the advertisers, and the only people who can be held up for more money are therefore the advertisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.593" offset="2060762">It is undisputed on this record that advertisers pay only for viewers actually delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.914" offset="2090019">They are buying audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.116" offset="2098797">The TV networks pay the suppliers of programs only to the extent the programs summon viewers to their sets.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="493.388" stopTime="505.529">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="493.388" offset="2131920">Well, but the contracts between the TV networks and the colleges are not dependent on receipt of revenue by the TV stations.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.660" offset="2172984">They're outright flat commitments.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_h_easterbrook" startTime="505.529" stopTime="650.885">
            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="505.529" offset="2180508">They are flat commitments, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.912" offset="2190016">But the amount of money the network will be willing to pay as a flat commitment or a contingent commitment depends on how many viewers it thinks it can get, and in fact the networks are very sensitive to that, going into quite complicated calculations before making bids based on the number of viewers.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.090" offset="2258770">We think the right way to look at the transaction in this case is that the NCAA and its members supply programs to television stations and to networks.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.481" offset="2304328">If a program supplier makes its programs scarcer or less attractive, fewer people watch.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.737" offset="2341317">If fewer people watch, the network gets less money and it therefore is willing to bid less for the programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.010" offset="2370365">And therefore, a program supplier cannot make itself better off by reducing its quality or the number of programs it supplies.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.865" offset="2409863">It can't get a higher price per viewer because advertisers take the viewers as essentially fungible and it therefore has no market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.173" offset="2451032">Now, that in a word is our whole argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.708" offset="2465242">Respondents say that we are quibbling with the lower court's facts and inferences.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.362" offset="2491783">But we think a lot more is at issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.231" offset="2503277">The question, wholly a question of law, is what the lower courts should address their findings to.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.051" offset="2526578">We say that as a matter of law a lower court can't find market power without finding that the defendant has the ability to raise the price, to make itself better off by reducing output.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.875" offset="2577882">The court must address and answer the question whether there is an ability to enrich the defendant's pockets by harming consumers.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.333" offset="2619678">Neither lower court even addressed that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="618.368" offset="2631799">In fact, neither lower court thought that was the legally relevant question to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="622.337" offset="2647681">The lower courts took different, but in our view equally erroneous, approaches to the market power question.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.574" offset="2676625">The district court said that it would decide whether there was market power by defining a market and that it would define the market by looking at what it is that plaintiffs sell.</text>
            <text syncTime="642.132" offset="2726885">What plaintiffs sell is football games.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.333" offset="2743708">The University of Oklahoma and the University of Georgia sell football, not ads.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="650.885" stopTime="685.209">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="650.885" offset="2761889">Mr. Easterbrook, as a judge who is an expert neither in antitrust nor football, I get the impression occasionally that this market definition thing is a game that many people can play at.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.211" offset="2815179">One person says A plus B equals C is the equation we ought to have to decide it, and somebody else says, oh, no, it's E plus F equals G.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.417" offset="2852063">I get the impression perhaps that the first person to have a bite at the apple, that is the district court, frequently can say what the rules on which the game is played.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="frank_h_easterbrook" startTime="685.209" stopTime="747.782">
            <label>Mr. Frank H. Easterbrook</label>
            <text syncTime="685.209" offset="2899188">I think that's right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.260" offset="2911414">There is an enormous amount of elasticity in defining the market, and that is one reason why I have not been talking about the definition of a market.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.318" offset="2955613">In a sense, you can define the market in this business as football games that appear on TV, or as college football games that appear on TV in the fall, or as some other market.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.609" offset="3008798">Our principal argument is that, since the market definition game is so easy to play and so easily manipulable, that it is in cases of this sort the wrong game to play; that what you want to determine is not a formal definition of the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.689" offset="3085076">It is not a game of lexicographic legerdemain in which you want to see who can get the upper definitional hand.</text>
            <text syncTime="737.676" offset="3109108">But instead, the objective is to set out to find out whether the defendants really have the ability to raise prices by reducing the amount of their output.</text>

            <text syncTime="753.952" offset="3174205">Well, by manipulate, Mr. Chief Justice, I mean that the market definition, the definitional exercise, is as inevitably arbitrary as any exercise in definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="766.577" offset="3224674">In a sense, it has to be right that there is a market in college football games, because a lot of people specialize in selling college football games and don't sell much else.</text>

            <text syncTime="785.755" offset="3301370">I don't mean that the participants in the market can manipulate it to their benefit or to detriment.</text>
            <text syncTime="791.542" offset="3324566">I was just suggesting that market definition, like any other definitional exercise, really is subject to the Humpty-Dumpty problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="801.417" offset="3364063">That is, when I use a word, says Humpty-Dumpty, it means exactly what I say it means, neither more nor less.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.369" offset="3383812">And it is possible to define almost an infinitely large number of markets in any antitrust case.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.974" offset="3410248">The legal question that we're presenting is not which is the formally correct definition, because there is no formally correct definition, but has the lower court tried to put its finger, or to draw a circle around a set of activities that gives people who engage in those activities the power to drive up price by reducing how much they sell?</text>
            <text syncTime="836.756" offset="3505438">And that's where we say the lower courts have failed, because they haven't even attempted to do that.</text>

            <text syncTime="852.032" offset="3566460">I thought the district court at page 75A of the opinion said something quite different, that they pay a much higher rate for Saturday football than they do for baseball or soap operas.</text>

            <text syncTime="865.507" offset="3620377">That's correct, they pay a much higher rate per thousand viewers per 30-minute spot than they do for pro baseball.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.065" offset="3662591">The question is what one makes of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="879.433" offset="3676070">As it turns out, the data which we collect in a footnote in our brief shows that they pay a much lower rate than for pro football, they pay about 51 percent less than for horse racing, and 131 percent less than for Dynasty.</text>
            <text syncTime="893.676" offset="3733121">Now, as it turns out, it is undisputed on this record that the source of the differential payment per thousand viewers per 30-second spots is that people of different demographic characteristics watch.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.090" offset="3810757">The plaintiffs' principal expert witness, Dr. Horowitz, testified at pages 602 to 604 of the appendix that the reason why the NCAA gets a higher price per viewer is that the people who watch have a higher amount of education than the people who watch baseball.</text>
            <text syncTime="931.634" offset="3884945">Advertisers are always willing to pay more for more educated, higher income viewers, on the theory that they go out and buy more.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.638" offset="3912948">What you then have to answer in order to figure out whether the NCAA has market power, given the difference in these viewers, is whether there is something special about the NCAA's audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="953.981" offset="3974284">If they get a uniquely high demographic group, then maybe there is some ability to exploit the advertisers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1040.320" offset="4319623">The Court of Appeals by and large declined to reach our attacks on the district court's findings, because it had still another legal theory about market power which it invoked and then stopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1052.978" offset="4370300">The theory that the Court of Appeals invoked on market power is principally that you tell whether the NCAA has market power by seeing whether it gets a higher total price per ad, per 30-second ad.</text>
            <text syncTime="1067.804" offset="4429546">It turns out the NCAA does get a higher total price per 30-second ad than other Saturday afternoon programming, because the NCAA attracts more viewers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1079.260" offset="4475417">And the Court of Appeals said that shows market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1082.647" offset="4489001">Well, our argument is that that is a legally erroneous basis for inferring things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.016" offset="4506450">It's the equivalent of a court saying, if someone makes a better mousetrap and sells more of the mousetraps, that that demonstrates that he must have market power because he's getting higher gross revenues.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.358" offset="4559845">But that is as unsupported a basis for inferring market power as one can come up with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1106.512" offset="4584400">In the advertising business it is conceded all around that you get a higher price per ad the more people who watch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1115.535" offset="4620553">But the more people who watch is an increase in output.</text>
            <text syncTime="1119.987" offset="4638317">If the NCAA has figured out some method to get the number of viewers up from 10 million to 20 million, it certainly gets more viewers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1127.593" offset="4668723">But I think it stands antitrust law on its head to say that that's proof of market power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1133.412" offset="4692024">The appropriate inference to draw from that is that that's proof of success in competition and increasing one's output.</text>
            <text syncTime="1140.566" offset="4720654">But let me come back to the method that we have tried to use for inferring market power.</text>

            <text syncTime="1388.612" offset="5712785">I keep coming back to drawing the distinction, which I think is very important to this case, between the price per game and the price per viewer, since it is, after all, that networks are delivering viewers to advertisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1406.740" offset="5785301">Suppose that the difference in this case is that football viewers, when turned out, will fetch $4.81 per 30-second spot.</text>
            <text syncTime="1418.547" offset="5832530">That's what the Nielson data suggests that football viewers fetch.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.916" offset="5846010">If you have just one national game on TV, the price paid for that game may be $2 million, because all the viewers show up and watch the same game.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.474" offset="5888223">If instead you had ten different games, the price per game may be $200,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1438.295" offset="5911525">But the fact that you end up with a higher price for the national network broadcast than for the local broadcast just tells you where the viewers are concentrated, rather than that there's any market power over the viewers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1450.936" offset="5962098">I can change the example just a little to other things that go on in the entertainment industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.189" offset="5991146">When any packager or program producer produces his programs, he will enter into some kind of exclusivity clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.497" offset="6036390">In fact, exclusivity is the order of the day in this business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.532" offset="6048511">When the producer of Dallas sells his package to the network, there will be exclusivity clauses of at least two sorts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1480.972" offset="6082261">One will be, say, that only CBS can show Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.574" offset="6096681">The other will be that reruns will be held out of syndication for some period of time, five years perhaps.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.196" offset="6127192">And it turns out that as a result of that each episode of Dallas collects more viewers and therefore a higher price than it would if CBS had a Dallas and ABC had a Dallas and they were shown head to head.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.355" offset="6187796">That would fracture the audience.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.339" offset="6191766">The question is whether you would infer from that that Dallas has market power, and we think not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.609" offset="6216844">I don't think there's any doubt in this record, I don't think that Mr. Coats or the Solicitor General will say, that the TV programming market is anything other than cutthroat competition, with hundreds, maybe thousands of program suppliers bidding for these time slots on the network in order to supply their programming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1535.459" offset="6300227">Dallas is in head to head competition with everything that Mary Tyler Moore Productions makes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.576" offset="6316632">One of the things we learn from that arrangement is that exclusivity, limiting the head to head, Dallas versus Dallas competition, proves to be a wonderful competitive tool in the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.288" offset="6383505">It has a lot to do with your ability to advertise Dallas, get people to watch Dallas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.907" offset="6402000">If it's on one network exclusively you can advertise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.292" offset="6415583">The failure to split the audience, that is not having multiple series competing against one another, enables you to spend more producing and increasing the quality of the particular series.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.201" offset="6471172">One of the things, one of the inferences that I think is a very important inference in the market power question is that when all the producers of television, essentially all the sports leagues, the producers of drama, the producers of movies, the producers of comedies, all engage in exactly the same kind of exclusivity arrangements that the NCAA has engaged in, there is a very weak basis for inferring that these arrangements are an exercise of or a means of exploiting market power and very good reason for thinking that that's the way in which people compete in this market.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.844" offset="6625712">There are really two competing hypotheses here about what the NCAA is doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1625.180" offset="6659045">The one hypothesis which Justice Stevens has brought up is that the NCAA has market power and it's reducing the number of games.</text>

            <text syncTime="1760.702" offset="7201138">We think it is very relevant in this market in the following sense: A group of amateur and educational nonprofit schools and the NCAA may well undertake certain practices which deliberately fail to maximize its profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.866" offset="7277833">When the NCAA says, we are running programs of amateur football, it is probably reducing its net profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.305" offset="7311583">It might be able to get more viewers and so on if it had semi-professional clubs rather than amateur clubs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.292" offset="7339587">The NCAA might be able to increase its intake if it abolished or reduced the academic standards that its players must meet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.767" offset="7381487">But we don't think the intentional sacrifice of profit is any objection to this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.087" offset="7414715">Nowhere is it written in the antitrust laws that everybody has to maximize profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.055" offset="7434568">What the antitrust laws do is provide that someone can't maximize his profit by monopolizing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2304.752" offset="9377347">The NCAA bylaws which control the televising of college football games and the exclusive network contracts which govern the sale of these rights are classic violations of the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2318.976" offset="9434294">It is really doubtful if anyone would seriously contend they were even defensible in any other context.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.213" offset="9459267">We have two lower courts that have found as a matter of fact that the purpose and the effect of the NCAA TV plan and contracts has been to fix prices in the sense of fixing the-price for all the games, fixing the price of the individual games, limiting the availability of the product, limiting output, for the purpose of driving up the price.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.095" offset="9562712">Now, at trial this was not really contested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.649" offset="9576922">This was proclaimed, that indeed the network witnesses for NCAA, the Executive Director of NCAA, Mr. Byers, all said that if we didn't have this, the limitations, if we didn't have the plan all together, that the networks would grind down the prices.</text>
            <text syncTime="2370.909" offset="9642019">And he said that, if we didn't have the limitations and we weren't the exclusive bargaining agent, there would be lots and lots more games on television.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.347" offset="9679740">And that's what the lower courts found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.466" offset="9688204">They found that indeed, if this limitation of output, this limitation on the number of games was not in place, that there would be so many more games, mostly on the basis of local and regional circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.831" offset="13073673">But the questions about the market... really, we see ourselves in a situation of furnishing a raw product.</text>
            <text syncTime="3236.485" offset="13104289">We play football games and we play them whether they're on television or not on television.</text>

            <text syncTime="3243.674" offset="13133023">They come in and they add announcers and people to bring color and instant replay and music, and they take a program and sell that to the advertisers.</text>

            <text syncTime="3269.539" offset="13236573">But there's also a market in the sale of these football games, and it's earmarked, I think, by the fact that a good part of what we really want to do and what's involved in this case is a sale where there are no advertisers involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="3320.341" offset="13439701">And then I think the fact that the decisions of this Court in International Boxing, that found that championship boxing was a separate market apart from all boxing, that first run movies were indeed a separate market from all movies, that there certainly is and two courts have found, a very solid, clearly defined, clearly delineated relevant market for the sale of the games.</text>
            <text syncTime="3350.943" offset="13562163">And as he indicated in his reply brief in here, if that's the market NCAA can't prevail here, and we think that that certainly is the market.</text>
            <text syncTime="3357.680" offset="13589121">We think that there are differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3360.180" offset="13599048">There are integrations, rulemaking integrations that they make, that control athletics and control the plays of the games and that sort of thing, and they ought to be there.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.619" offset="13628828">Where they get into commerce as directly in commerce as they are here, they really ought to play by the same rules that everybody else does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.856" offset="13657771">We think that would cause regionalization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.325" offset="13667698">We think that would increase, as the courts found, competitive balance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.109" offset="13682849">We think their attempt to justify this on the basis that it somehow increases live attendance is really not so; that the courts found that it wasn't so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3390.734" offset="13721301">But more importantly, look what's happened in the other sports.</text>
            <text syncTime="3393.769" offset="13733422">Professional football has come along and they have allowed themselves to regionalize.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.007" offset="13754424">The people have developed a following for the game and you can't buy a ticket in live attendance to a professional game.</text>

            <text syncTime="3430.026" offset="13878454">We think the courts found the contrary and we think as a matter of fact and logic and intuition that that's not so, that the ability to market the product, and again we point to basketball, that live attendance has increased substantially while television has been totally unlimited.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.636" offset="13936863">And we really believe that the decision by this Court affirming the lower courts would be very healthy for football, will indeed cause a lot of teams that are never on these days to be able to be on, to display their wares, their products, and their teams, and indeed return as to the free market, which is where we think this matter should rest.</text>

            <text syncTime="3468.984" offset="14034352">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Courts:</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.388" offset="14051907">I submit that the one thing that should be apparent by now is that, regardless of the path by which the result is reached, whether it's per se violation; full-blown rule of reason analysis, or a more carefully tailored rule of reason middle ground, it should be apparent that the Sherman Act has been violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.117" offset="14126826">Two federal courts have determined as a matter of fact that the NCAA TV plan restricts output.</text>
            <text syncTime="3499.873" offset="14157859">Now, there is this debate over whether viewership is really restricted or enhanced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3506.276" offset="14183459">It all ties back to a citation, a reference in the reply brief back to our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.513" offset="14208432">The reply brief quotes our brief as saying:</text>
            <text syncTime="3516.548" offset="14224524">"The exclusivity factor of the package allows the chosen few networks to deliver larger audiences. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.786" offset="14249497">That occurs at the top of page 19 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.440" offset="14264125">The larger audiences to which we are referring, consistent with the findings of two lower courts, is the larger audience, the larger audiences for those few games that are subject to the exclusive package, and that of course is larger.</text>
            <text syncTime="3542.532" offset="14328491">That is the very purpose of price-fixing and restriction of output.</text>
            <text syncTime="3547.519" offset="14348449">But there is no finding in the record concerning total viewership.</text>
            <text syncTime="3551.305" offset="14363600">I'd like to concentrate on the narrow difference between the NCAA's position and the Government's position, because I believe it will be helpful to the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3560.594" offset="14400694">The area of agreement, in the NCAA's words, is that it accepts our framework for analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.267" offset="14427443">Let me say just a word about what that accepted framework is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3570.885" offset="14441863">Our experience as the principal enforcers of the antitrust laws is that the identification of unlawful restraints of trade under Section 1 of the Sherman Act requires more than just two polar extremes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.578" offset="14508632">The per se rule on the one hand, which is simply a special case of application of the rule of reason, is too limiting.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.917" offset="14537993">And on the other hand, the Petitioner agrees with us that the full-blown rule of reason analysis often opens the door to virtually unlimited discovery and introduction of evidence of every conceivable effect the defendant's practice might have on competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.046" offset="14606539">We believe that what is needed is not a novel rule, but is rather what is already reflected not only in this Court's Broadcast Music and Professional Engineers decisions, but also in the common sense underpinnings of the rule of reason itself, that the rule occupies the entire spectrum of inquiry into effect on competition and not just the two end points of that spectrum.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.879" offset="14717925">And this is the framework for analysis which the NCAA accepts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3645.681" offset="14741121">The narrow point of disagreement is that in the NCAA's view the tailored rule of reason approach always requires a showing of market power and in this particular case it specifically requires a showing that the NCAA has market power over advertisers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3664.911" offset="14818026">That point of disagreement is squarely controlled by the factual findings of two federal courts.</text>
