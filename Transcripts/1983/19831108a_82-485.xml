            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="159602">We will hear arguments first in Kathy Keeton against Hustler Magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.919" offset="195233">Mr. Grutman, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norman_roy_grutman" startTime="15.198" stopTime="299.723">
            <label>Mr. Norman Roy Grutman</label>
            <text syncTime="15.198" offset="220311">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="19.290" offset="236715">This case presents the question of whether or not the sovereign State of New Hampshire's long-arm statute is to be denied enforcement under the due process clause despite the conduct of Hustler in circulating its magazines in New Hampshire out of which a cause of action for libel arose.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.764" offset="330652">The libel in question was part of a series of unprovoked calumnies and vilifications heaped upon the Plaintiff accusing her of among other things licentious promiscuity and having a venereal disease which in any jurisdiction would be tantamount to libel per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.725" offset="414453">The law suit was initially instituted in the state court of Ohio in 1977 where there appeared to be no question about obtaining personal jurisdiction over both Mr. Flynt personally and his magazine.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.061" offset="479759">At the outset of the litigation Ohio specifically applied its own statute of limitations to dismiss the libel claim while upholding the viability of Plaintiff's claim for invasion of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.430" offset="541303">Relying upon that determination for several years thereafter Plaintiff continued to vigorously prosecute her case in Ohio until on the night before trial was to commence the Ohio trial court reversed itself and applied the New York statute of limitations reparable to the cause of action for invasion of privacy and dismissed the Plaintiff's case entirely out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.936" offset="639315">After the Plaintiff's appeal was affirmed by the Ohio Appellate Court Plaintiff promptly brought a diversity law suit in New Hampshire serving the Defendants under the New Hampshire long-arm statute which the New Hampshire Supreme Court has interpreted as being intended to be extended as far as the Constitution will permit under the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.723" offset="730430">The District Court found that while the New Hampshire long-arm statute was satisfied due process forbad entertaining the action and it dismissed it giving two reasons: Plaintiff's lack of connections or contacts with the State of New Hampshire and the alleged lack of New Hampshire's interest in the litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.604" offset="830009">The First Circuit affirmed without disturbing the District Court's evaluation of the Defendant's presence in New Hampshire as regular, systematic and continuous because of the monthly circulation of Hustler seeking to exploit the New Hampshire market place which took place on a continuing basis since 1975.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.453" offset="933349">The reason or the reasoning of the First Circuit in affirming is epitomized in the catchy phrase at the conclusion of its opinion in which it said the New Hampshire tail is too small to wag so large an out of state dog.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.540" offset="1001685">The phrase captures what we submit to this Court is the essential misconception of the lower courts in assuming that jurisdiction turns on a little more or a little less of Plaintiff's contacts and damage in the forum overlooking that for 38 years since this Court's opinion in International Shoe the jurisdictional inquiry has always focused on the contacts of the defendant, not the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.478" offset="1149434">We submit to the Court that insofar as the assertion that jurisdiction is to be determined there are essentially three levels by which or three tiers by which a determination can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.910" offset="1211187">If a defendant by its continuous, systematic process can be said to be doing business then it is dogmatic that general jurisdiction exists in that forum for litigation against that defendant for all kinds of causes of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.465" offset="1285375">We do not argue in this case that we fall within that rubric.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.603" offset="1305960">We submit that synthesizing all of the cases in which this Court has spoken from International Shoe through Mr. Justice White's opinion in World-Wide Volkswagen.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="299.723" stopTime="300.848">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="299.723" offset="1358413">That was the Court's opinion.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norman_roy_grutman" startTime="300.848" stopTime="342.019">
            <label>Mr. Norman Roy Grutman</label>
            <text syncTime="300.848" offset="1362906">The Court's opinion written by Mr. Justice White.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.424" offset="1377222">Forgive me.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.940" offset="1379311">The synthesis of those cases holds that where you have purposeful conduct by a defendant directed at the forum in question and out of which conduct the cause of action arises or is generated that satisfies the formula of those minimum contacts which substantial justice and reasonable fair play make it suitable that a defendant should be hailed into that court and be amenable to suit in that jurisdiction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="342.019" stopTime="351.000">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="342.019" offset="1527582">I am a little surprised, Mr. Grutman.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.159" offset="1536151">You do not make much of the Boxite case which came after International Shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.907" offset="1555168">You cited in your reply brief but not in--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norman_roy_grutman" startTime="351.000" stopTime="376.911">
            <label>Mr. Norman Roy Grutman</label>
            <text syncTime="351.000" offset="1563527">Yes, we do, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.123" offset="1564049">The Boxite case as I interpret it has to do with the failure of the defendant who by its waiver to its failure to comply with orders of the court to demonstrate its nonamenability to suit was found by the Court in that case to have subjected itself to a determination that facts could be found against it so that jurisdiction could be properly assessed against that defendant.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="376.911" stopTime="381.097">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="376.911" offset="1667181">--But it certainly bears on World-Wide Volkswagen.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norman_roy_grutman" startTime="381.097" stopTime="558.243">
            <label>Mr. Norman Roy Grutman</label>
            <text syncTime="381.097" offset="1683899">I think it does, but I think that Volkswagen in its facts and in the more expansive treatment in the Court's opinion is a case which I think provides the springboard from which the Court can find in this lawsuit that what you have present in this case and what was lacking in Volkswagen.</text>
            <text syncTime="400.557" offset="1761744">In Volkswagen you had purely adventitious or fortuitous circumstances by which jurisdiction was asserted against a little automobile dealer in Mesena, New York whose only business was in Mesena, New York and who had no connection with the State of Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.987" offset="1839484">Similarly the tri-state regional dealer albeit under the name World-Wide Volkswagen it unlike Hustler in this case in no way for its economic advantage did business in Oklahoma or sold its products in Oklahoma.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.308" offset="1900820">As I read what the Court was saying and what your opinion I think pointed to Mr. Justice Blackmun is that you were looking for in the conduct of the defendant willful, purposeful economic activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.646" offset="1962155">Now that is clearly present in this case as it relates to Hustler because Huslter in the Court's opinion directly or indirectly was responsible on a systematic basis from 1975 for sending copies of its magazines into New Hampshire out of which the record shows they derived substantial economic benefit running into millions of dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.728" offset="2070511">That was not one insurance policy which this Court found sufficient in McGee v. International Insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.662" offset="2106247">That was a 1957 case and again tracing the sweep of this Court's opinions on jurisdiction starting with the germinal case of International Shoe and running through World-Wide Volkswagen into the Boxite case I think the Court has acknowledged that we are seeing an expansion of jurisdiction since the second World War in recognition of the changing facts of life in American society.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.306" offset="2224738">I say that on the second level of analysis which our reply brief attempted to explicate for the Court we believe that we are squarely within the philosophical underpinnings by which this Court has formulated those circumstances in which jurisdiction can properly be laid, and again I say the focus must be on the conduct of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.470" offset="2313450">Respondent's briefs tend to castigate us by opprobrious references to so-called forum shopping, which, while it is sort of a pungent phrase, seems to lose sight of the fact that it is not the plaintiff that creates the forum, it is the defendant, by his conduct in the forum.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="558.243" stopTime="571.456">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="558.243" offset="2392549">Of course, a nationwide publisher creates a forum, presumably, in almost any state, and I suppose it has always been libel plaintiff's position that they are perfectly at liberty to shop.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="norman_roy_grutman" startTime="571.456" stopTime="572.409">

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Norman Roy Grutman</label>
            <text syncTime="575.220" offset="2460467">I think that is absolutely correct, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, because libel is a peculiar kind of a tort, and when we are dealing with media defendants that are nationwide in the scope of the economic activities that they pursue, seeking the benefits of the marketplace nationwide, they have the unique ability of simultaneously creating the harm which the libel causes in all of the places where the publication is disseminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.507" offset="2557538">Now, the publications have the benefit of the single publication rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.709" offset="2574361">That is a rule which I think is uniformly recognized throughout the country in which the plaintiff is required to prove all of her damage or all of his damage in whichever forum the case is properly brought, but if one were to look at that from the standpoint of the publisher, what should the publisher do in the event of concern with statutes of limitations or the special niche which this Court has carved out for media defendants in libel cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="629.745" offset="2678538">This Court in its decisions beginning with Sullivan and working through Gertz against Welsh in the evolution of the public figure doctrine, has established that the states, so long as they do not create liability without fault, may establish standards which are different.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.207" offset="2744366">State A may say that it is gross negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.315" offset="2760771">State B may say that it is simple negligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.845" offset="2770906">State C may say it is the malice standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="656.094" offset="2783968">Now, assuming that we have a publication, of whatever nature, whether it is acceptable or presumably reputable, if a harm occurs nationwide, then conscientious and responsible lawyering would require that a plaintiff take cognizance of where it would be most propitious to bring the lawsuit, and in that, I think there is neither shame nor disgrace.</text>
            <text syncTime="677.413" offset="2869231">I think that it is an incident of our federal system under the peculiarity which adheres in defamation law.</text>
            <text syncTime="684.520" offset="2897653">The submission, may it please the Court, which we make, is that we are squarely within all of your prior holdings.</text>
            <text syncTime="693.969" offset="2935478">We are the case which International Volkswagen contemplated with the telling difference to which I have alluded and the argument that I have just made.</text>
            <text syncTime="702.778" offset="2970691">The contention is, however, made by respondents that there must be, in order for jurisdiction to be appropriate against an out of state resident in an action such as this, a so-called state's interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.305" offset="3020742">Well--</text>

            <text syncTime="729.846" offset="3078942">I suppose it must, because it is obvious that the state of New Hampshire would have accepted this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="769.517" offset="3237662">Well, no, I don't ask you to; but is that your understanding of respondent's contention?</text>
            <text syncTime="773.687" offset="3254276">When they talk about a state's interest, it isn't just a question of what New Hampshire wanted in this situation, but that there are some limits on what New Hampshire can do.</text>

          <turn speaker="norman_roy_grutman" startTime="783.309" stopTime="905.978">
            <label>Mr. Norman Roy Grutman</label>
            <text syncTime="783.309" offset="3292833">I am not really sure that I can agree with that, because I think that takes us into a very murky area, where it would be extremely difficult to predict or to understand what kind of state interest they want.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.741" offset="3338495">Perhaps, Mr. Justice Rehnquist, in another kind of a case, in a case in which you have something less than purposeful conduct out of which the cause of action arose, and you were looking to ascertain whether jurisdiction could be affirmed, you would have to find affiliating circumstances with the defendant plus a so-called state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.325" offset="3436820">Now, that kind of a state interest, if you look for it in this case, and it is to that to which I address my attention, is demonstrated, as we have set forth in our reply brief, by the fact that New Hampshire in 1971 amended its long arm statute so as to permit the use of that statute for non-residents.</text>
            <text syncTime="836.381" offset="3505052">It has interpreted its long arm statute to permit the furthest reach permissible under due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.457" offset="3529398">In Leaper versus Leaper, which was treated by the First Circuit, New Hampshire said it had an interest in protecting not only its residents but non-residents against just such kinds of harm as are involved in a case like this in libel, and lastly, New Hampshire, expressing as another part of the cluster of its evidences of its interest in this case, has a criminal statute which makes it a misdemeanor if anyone intentionally by falsehood holds someone up to the kind of ridicule, calumny, and obloquy which Mr. Flynt did in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.912" offset="3659174">So, if you ask me in this case, because I am not really entirely sure whether the respondents are advocating that there should be a general grab-bag of so-called state interests which are highly amorphous that should be considered at every stage in all cases in the equation of ascertaining if jurisdiction exists or not, that is so far cut of the question, I would prefer for the purposes of the adjudication of this case to confine myself simply to the facts of this case, and to point out that if you are looking for state interest, it is abundantly present in all of the indicia to which I have just alluded.</text>

            <label>Mr. Norman Roy Grutman</label>
            <text syncTime="3573.150" offset="14452134">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.445" offset="14457359">I would like to begin by responding to a question which you put to my colleague, and pointing to that place in the record, which is to be found at 15-A of the appendix, where the First Circuit said.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.284" offset="14512738">"The major factor favoring plaintiff is that she is suing in part for damages suffered in New Hampshire. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.376" offset="14537084">which is an acknowledgement of the fact that she did suffer injury in New Hampshire,</text>
            <text syncTime="3599.295" offset="14556729">"and although the defendant's contacts with New Hampshire are sparse, they were not random, isolated, or transitory. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3605.653" offset="14582120">"The general course of conduct in circulating magazines throughout the state was purposefully directed at New Hampshire. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.664" offset="14614198">Counsel has spoken to the Court about that state which has the paramount interest, and although the language was written by Mr. Justice Brennan in his dissent in Volkswagen, I do not think he was expressing anything with which the Court would disagree when he said that,</text>
            <text syncTime="3629.736" offset="14678459">"A defendant has no constitutional entitlement to the best forum or, for that matter, to any particular forum. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.373" offset="14705000">"Under even the most restrictive view of International Shoe, several states could have jurisdiction over a particular cause of action. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3644.324" offset="14736869">That is certainly the case in this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3647.542" offset="14749721">I promised that I would allude to something Mr. Justice Stevens raised at the conclusion of my principal remarks, and I would like not to omit what I was saying when I originally concluded, and that was namely that the district court focused on the plaintiff's lack of contacts, and therefore they never reached the minimum contacts of Flynt or of his publication, and they therefore dismissed a fortiori because of plaintiff's lack of contacts, and I submit that on remand we would, and T represent this responsibly, be able to demonstrate that Flynt had those contacts himself, as did the corporation, which would satisfy the International Shoe formula as to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.508" offset="14929548">The references made by counsel to the restatement were to the restatement of conflict, and I think that what is spoken of in that restatement primarily has to do with choice of law, not with jurisdiction or definition as to what constitutes a tort.</text>
            <text syncTime="3708.064" offset="14991824">There was a considerable reference to the inconvenience which, Madame Justice O'Connor, I think, is clearly dealt with under Section 1404(a) by which, after jurisdiction has been determined, the federal court has the flexibility by which under forum non-convenience to designate some other forum in which the case could be tried, but it ought to be mentioned that under the Van Dusen case, the corpus juris that would be applied so far as the statute of limitations is concerned is the corpus juris of the forum in which the action was brought, namely, New Hampshire.</text>
            <text syncTime="3741.863" offset="15127034">Essentially, what this Court has heard this morning is a claim which the respondents argue that other states' statutes of limitations prohibit New Hampshire from exercising a jurisdiction which for itself it has determined at six years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.089" offset="15207909">I would conclude, Mr. Chief Justice and members of this Court, by observing that that is an incident of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="3770.523" offset="15241659">It is a reflection of our diversity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3773.772" offset="15254616">If you travel around this country and look at the airports in which you land, we are so homogeneous it is almost impossible to know where you are, but I think that it is worthwhile that this Court should preserve the diversity which in no inconsiderable measure has been part of the richness and greatness of this country.</text>
