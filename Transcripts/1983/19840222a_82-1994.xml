            <text syncTime="127.231" offset="653502">That is a purpose which is accomplished by affecting a non-use, a non-use for economic purposes, a non-use for any purpose inconsistent with the wilderness preservation, and in this respect we would suggest to the Court that the purpose was accomplished at the time that the condemnation was filed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1027.340" offset="4253907">Our position, Your Honor, is that the practical impediments to the economic use of the property were such that after the filing of the complaint and after the posting of the lis pendence notice rendered all economic use unavailable, and this within this Court's police power taking analysis demonstrates that the burdens which the property has not borne before had reached the level that a taking occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.982" offset="4392565">Now, one of the vital questions in this case, and one which I don't believe this Court has addressed before authoritatively is the question of what is a taking in a Section 257 case absent physical possession?</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.677" offset="4471246">Is it the accrual of the title of the government, or, on the other hand, is it the deprivation of the interest of the landowner?</text>
            <text syncTime="1090.439" offset="4506355">We submit to the Court that it is the deprivation of the interest of the landowner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1095.718" offset="4527461">In this case, and this is the reason I emphasized the purpose of the condemnation here, is it the effective accomplishment of the purposes of the condemnation which is the taking?</text>
            <text syncTime="1109.994" offset="4584513">In this case, that is what we contend.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.711" offset="4599455">If the taking occurred at the time of the payment of the award, then that is tantamount to saying that it is the accrual of the title of the government rather than the deprivation of the interest of the landowner which is the test of the taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1130.751" offset="4667582">As the Court is aware, there is a conflict on this question between the Fifth and the Ninth Circuits, the Fifth Court in our case, the Ninth Circuit in two separate cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.699" offset="4719409">The Ninth Circuit has held that in one case the date of the judgment was the date of taking, and in the other case that the date of evaluation of the property was the date of taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.508" offset="4762668">The Court in our case followed the Danforth decision, the 1939 decision of this Court, in holding that it was the date of the payment of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.065" offset="4804882">The problem with that situation as applied to this case is that property was valued in March of 1979.</text>

            <text syncTime="1325.141" offset="5445195">The first is that the word "property" in the Fifth Amendment refers to ownership interest, and not to the physical property itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1335.356" offset="5486051">This question was authoritatively decided in United States against General Motors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.416" offset="5506217">The second is that a taking does not require physical invasion or appropriation or passage of title.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.914" offset="5540281">This proposition has, we think, also been affirmatively and authoritatively decided, most recently in Penn Central Transportation against the City of New York, and Justice Brennan's dissent, which may very well have represented a majority point of view in that case, and San Diego Gas and Electric against City of San Diego.</text>
            <text syncTime="1372.200" offset="5633381">The third, and the one... one of the two which we want to emphasize to the greatest extent, is that value is to be determined as of the date of taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.711" offset="5679461">That is a constitutional mandate much supported by and announced by the decisions of this Court, but not, very candidly, observed in practice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.159" offset="5733169">The problems are, you must have a date of valuation at some point during the process of condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1405.826" offset="5767860">That date will always be before the date of the payment of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.543" offset="5790743">If the date of the payment of the award is determined then to be the date of taking, you cannot have a coincident date of valuation and date of taking.</text>

            <text syncTime="1846.478" offset="7530498">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the basic procedure that the government uses in exercising its power of eminent domain is the straight condemnation or complaint procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.409" offset="7586191">Under that procedure, the government files a complaint stating that it wants to take specific property, and asking the court to establish its price.</text>
            <text syncTime="1870.499" offset="7626629">That is just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.467" offset="7634466">A hearing is held, and the condemnation award is issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.732" offset="7651497">That award establishes the price of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.902" offset="7664245">If the government wants the property at that price, it pays the condemnation award, and at that moment takes both the title and the right to possession of the property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.037" offset="7708758">The sale, the taking occurs when the property and the money change hands.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.613" offset="7735089">This straight condemnation procedure is the one involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1903.001" offset="7756614">It is ordinarily the procedure that is least intrusive from the landowner's point of view, because it permits him to remain in possession until the price is determined and paid in full.</text>
            <text syncTime="1915.136" offset="7805097">In 1931, Congress added a provision permitting the government to obtain immediate title and possession by filing a declaration of taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.195" offset="7841355">When that declaration is filed, usually at the same time as the complaint but not necessarily, that establishes the sale date.</text>
            <text syncTime="1933.379" offset="7878136">In rare instances when the government has entered into possession before it files a declaration of taking, the date that it assumes possession is the date of the sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="3316.601" offset="13410975">The government should be allowed more leeway when it is establishing parks and preserving scenic values by condemning land and paying for it than when it tries to achieve the same results by zoning and imposing the burdens on the landowner without paying him anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.374" offset="13490074">Mayen and Dow recognize that, and the dissent in Penn Central certainly sounds as though the dissenters would have agreed with the majority that there was no taking if the complaint there had involved simply temporary interferences in the course of a condemnation proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3355.023" offset="13564679">Long delays in paying condemnation awards of course may hurt landowners, but they are not the helpless victims that petitioner portrays.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.080" offset="13600937">First, because the landowner is entitled to the fair market value at the time his land is taken, he is entitled to show that the land has increased in value since the original valuation date.</text>
            <text syncTime="3374.483" offset="13642524">That showing shouldn't require a complicated supplementary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.559" offset="13658825">Indeed, it is probably going to be possible often to negotiate a stipulation because all that will be involved is whether comparable real estate values have gone up.</text>

            <text syncTime="3394.756" offset="13723608">That's true, but the point is that it's... what you have to be concerned about is the market value of the land, and not the interest rate, and our point is that the proceeding is not probably going to be a very complicated one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3415.778" offset="13807723">What you are talking about is land values.</text>
            <text syncTime="3418.153" offset="13817231">You don't have to... Petitioner suggests that you are going to have to start the whole proceeding over again.</text>

            <text syncTime="3431.600" offset="13870939">So that... but as I say, it shouldn't be a complicated determination to make.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.816" offset="13907824">And the other point is that if the land values have gone up very steeply, the payment of interest isn't going to afford the landowner just compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3455.980" offset="13968533">On the other hand, where the land values have dropped, as it may well be they have here, the interest will give the landowner a windfall.</text>
            <text syncTime="3466.384" offset="14010119">If the landowner can't show that the land has appreciated, he can also move to dismiss the condemnation suit under Rule 71(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3476.785" offset="14051706">If the District Court agrees that the government's delay has been unreasonable, it can dismiss the suit, and the government must then pay the landowner's litigation costs, including attorneys' fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.593" offset="14098936">That is under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Land Acquisition Policies Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3495.793" offset="14127775">A landowner in petitioner's position has a third alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3500.572" offset="14146897">It is pretty clear that if the Park Service had concluded that he was seriously considering cutting his timber, the government would have filed a declaration of taking, and at that point, of course, we would have had to deposit the estimated value of the property, and he would then have become entitled to interest, just as he claims now that he is, so that he had it within his power to get an immediate taking if that was what he wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="3536.417" offset="14290257">Unless there are further questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3552.925" offset="14356294">May it please the Court, what we are talking about here is the paramount power of the government to take property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3561.782" offset="14391716">The position of the government is that that does not occur until it exercises possession or control over the landowner's property.</text>
            <text syncTime="3574.714" offset="14443439">That position, we submit to the Court, is totally contrary to this Court's own analyses of the takings questions in police power cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3587.819" offset="14495893">We have suggested to the Court that a separate analysis might well be given to eminent domain cases, as I think is appropriate, but in that separate analysis it would be clear that the character of the taking, the character of the government action which was being analyzed is this paramount power to take.</text>
            <text syncTime="3612.979" offset="14596516">Mr. Justice Brennan in his dissent in San Diego Gas and Electric noted in a footnote that where the property is to remain unused, undisturbed, and in its natural state, paraphrasing, in this sense, the property is being used by the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.128" offset="14685124">We submit to the Court that the principles which were announced in Justice Brennan's dissent in that case are applicable to the analysis which should be made of the power of the government to take in eminent domain cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3652.370" offset="14754087">The Court... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.774" offset="14771641">The government relies on the Danforth decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3658.243" offset="14777597">Danforth does not support the absolutist position taken by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3665.755" offset="14807586">Danforth held that a taking could occur in actuality before the payment of the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="3673.503" offset="14838619">It also held that in order for an act of the government to amount to a taking, it must result in an appropriation of the property to the uses of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3682.826" offset="14875922">That is precisely what has happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3685.404" offset="14886162">This property was appropriated to the uses of the government, was being, in effect, used by the public because of its preservation in a natural state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3694.166" offset="14921270">The government suggests that we should go through an inverse condemnation process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3700.148" offset="14945199">I submit that that is totally inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3702.193" offset="14953349">What we have is a just compensation question under the Fifth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.958" offset="14972366">To relegate the taxpayer, the landowner to the Court of Claims is to divide the just compensation issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.938" offset="15008310">If the government withdraws its condemnation, and is allowed to do so by the District Court, then there may be an inverse condemnation question, but once the--</text>
