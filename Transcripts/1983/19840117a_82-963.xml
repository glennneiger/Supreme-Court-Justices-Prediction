            <label>Ms. Barbara A. H. Smith</label>
            <text syncTime="62.330" offset="395550">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="65.342" offset="407566">This case presents the question whether the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires application of the exclusionary rule to evidence seized by police acting under the authority of a search warrant issued upon a finding of probable cause but which is later invalidated because of the technical error of omission committed by the issuing judge, an error of which the police had no knowledge, took no advantage and which resulted in no prejudice to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.186" offset="534939">The Supreme Judicial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ruled that suppression was required because this Court had not yet recognized an exception to application of the exclusionary rule for an error of this type.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.095" offset="594603">The court, thus, overruled the trial court's determination that although the warrant was defective the issuing judge failing to restate in the warrant the items specified in the application or to incorporate that affidavit by reference, he declined to exclude the evidence finding that the police had acted properly in conducting their duties, that they had acted upon probable cause and in good faith thus presenting a factual situation in which the exclusion would have no deterrent effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.999" offset="738172">Rather, the sole consequence of exclusion would be to deprive the jury of the real and probative evidence, thus, impairing their fact finding function.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.457" offset="788013">I think the factual situation in this case is extremely important, and I will, therefore, elaborate on it in some detail.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.052" offset="814345">At 5 a.m. the morning of May 5, 1979, a Saturday morning, the badly burned, partially clad body of a young woman was found in a vacant lot in the Roxbury District of Boston.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.801" offset="865440">A piece of wire was bound around one leg.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.732" offset="881114">An autopsy disclosed that the victim had died of multiple skull fractures.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.015" offset="902221">The victim had been alive but unconscious when her body was set on fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.419" offset="919879">By midday the victim had been identified and Osborne Sheppard had been identified as a possible boyfriend.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.094" offset="950599">An officer who knew Sheppard as a gambler began to circulate through the Roxbury area stopping at a gaming house he knew Sheppard to frequent.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.991" offset="990201">Sheppard himself opened the door, and after some conversation with the police agreed to accompany them to the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.635" offset="1016741">He was given his Miranda rights in the car on the way to the station.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.759" offset="1033251">He was told that the police were investigating the death of Sandra Boulware, and they wanted to examine his relationship with Ms. Boulware and establish his whereabouts on May 4th and 5th.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.486" offset="1076092">Mr. Sheppard told the police that he had visited with the victim at her home on Tuesday, May 1st, that they together had taken a taxi cab back to his home, stopping on the way to purchase some marijuana and a bottle of Amaretto.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.554" offset="1132412">He said that the victim had left him at approximately 2 p.m. on Tuesday.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.906" offset="1149861">He also stated that he had been at the gaming house where the police had found him from 9 p.m. on Friday until 5 a.m. that Saturday morning.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.323" offset="1191448">After naming some other individuals who had been at the gaming house with him, he left the police station.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.057" offset="1214436">Continuing their investigation that afternoon the police questioned the other members of the gaming establishment who said that indeed Osborne Sheppard had left.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.493" offset="1256128">He had left at approximately 3 a.m. borrowing a car to drive some men home on a trip that ordinarily took 15 minutes although he did not return until 4:45 a.m. and then abruptly left again.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.353" offset="1307641">The police also learned that on leaving the gaming house at 6 a.m. one of the occupants noticed on the porch a gasoline can and a pair of gloves.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.969" offset="1346093">On Sunday morning, the police learned from a friend of Sheppards that he had refinished his basement area, and this was an area in which he entertained women for social purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.866" offset="1389666">Most importantly on that Sunday morning the owner of the automobile corroborated the fact that Sheppard had borrowed his car.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.903" offset="1421848">On inspection of the car the police and a police chemist found human blood stains and pieces of hair on the rear bumper near the trunk area.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.857" offset="1461659">In the trunk area they found more human blood stains and pieces of wire similar to that which had been found on the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.661" offset="1492797">The owner of the car told them that there was no wire and no blood in the trunk of that car on Friday night before he had loaned it to Sheppard.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.417" offset="1527801">It was then after consultation with the district attorney's office determined that arrest and search warrants should be obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.444" offset="1559984">A Detective O'Malley typed an affidavit in support of the application for the search warrant demonstrating probable cause for the search and the seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.482" offset="1608154">He specifically enumerated in his application describing the condition of the body that had been beaten and burned, that Sheppard had been the last person known to have seen the victim, that he and the victim had gone to 42 Deckard Street, that Sheppard had been in possession of a particular automobile, which was found to have blood stains and human hair on it that had not been there prior to Sheppard's using the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.578" offset="1716510">He reiterated that a friend had told them that Sheppard used his basement area for entertaining women and O'Malley, therefore, specified the areas to be searched as the second floor and second area controlled by Sheppard at 42 Deckard Street.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.480" offset="1780144">He specified the items to be seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.211" offset="1791011">Probable cause for the seizure of each item was related to the facts as set out in the affidavit.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.456" offset="1820059">The items included the fifth of Amaretto, two nickel bags of marijuana, possessions of Sandra Boulware, wire matching that found on the body or in the trunk of the car, men's or women's clothing having blood or gasoline stains, blunt instruments, which may have been used to inflict the multiple fractures, and items with the victim's fingerprints.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.672" offset="1912846">It was then Sunday afternoon and O'Malley was unable to find a proper warrant form.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.716" offset="1941058">The Roxbury court was closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.987" offset="1950149">Efforts to contact the clerks were unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.002" offset="1970211">Efforts to find a proper warrant form at other police stations was also unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.986" offset="1994139">O'Malley did find a warrant form used by the Dorchester District Court for searches for controlled substances, which he attempted to adapt.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.092" offset="2030501">He crossed out the words 42 Deckard Street, second floor and basement as the places to be searched.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.364" offset="2103644">He did not at that time delete the reference to controlled substance in the portion of the form constituting the application which, when signed, would constitute the warrant itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.742" offset="2149202">The trial court found, and I think it is important to note, that all of the items listed in the affidavit were small and susceptible of easy destruction and transport and were located in a place to which the defendant had total right of access.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.664" offset="2212836">The defendant was at liberty, and he was known to spend his evenings with the occupants of the gaming house that had given the information about the car.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.788" offset="2249303">Therefore, it was essential that the police move with great dispatch, and they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.621" offset="2268634">Arrangements were made to meet with the judge at his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.463" offset="2280023">O'Malley accompanied by other investigating officers and an assistant district attorney went there at approximately 2:45 p.m.--</text>
            <text syncTime="542.008" offset="2314191">The judge took O'Malley's oath and signed the affidavit to that effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.651" offset="2328820">The trial judge found as fact that the judge had concluded upon the affidavit that probable cause existed to search the premises and for the items listed.</text>

            <text syncTime="568.756" offset="2421189">He showed the judge the controlled substance form, and the judge then attempted to search his library for a proper form.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.179" offset="2442923">He was unable to find one, and he took the form from O'Malley assuring him that he would make the necessary changes.</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.848" offset="6585525">It is a remedy that is simply not consistent with the degree, the extent or the effect of the error committed in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.363" offset="6623664">Commonwealth, therefore, requests this Court to recognize an exception to application of the exclusionary rule where the police act in reasonably-based good faith, not merely subjective good faith at all, in obtaining a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1635.686" offset="6688970">Such an exception, it is submitted, is not inconsistent with the concerns which gave rise to the exclusionary rule in the first instance for it would have no effect under dispositions of those cases involving warrantless rummaging through a person's belongings or other flagrant violations as were the case in Weeks and Mapp, nor would it permit police falsification of the facts according a finding of probable cause because by definition that would not be reasonable good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.685" offset="6812895">It would simply be an explicit recognition that exclusion of evidence at the expense of the public where police have complied with the warrant process in an objectively reasonable manner simply has no legitimate justifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.216" offset="6871096">The exception would not be inconsistent with prior recent rulings of this Court which have implicitly recognized that the deterrent purpose of the rule is not effectuated where the police have acted in a reasonable manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1693.021" offset="6918221">Finally, I would suggest that the exception would serve two salutory purposes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.975" offset="6942044">First, the exception will serve to foster this Court's stated preference for warranted searches so that a neutral and detached magistrate is interposed between the police and the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.824" offset="6985512">Second, by granting consideration to the extent and effect of the error rather than the mere fact of the error, it will restore some degree of proportionality to our criminal justice system and acknowledge the that truth-finding function of our system will not be unreasonably impaired by inflexible mechanistic application of the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1733.379" offset="7079657">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.315" offset="7887468">The State says that there was probable cause for this search and that the search described in the application was, in fact, authorized by the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.253" offset="7943161">Because there is no proper warrant executed by the magistrate in this case, something which reflects on its face that certain findings were made by the magistrate after consideration, the facts set forth in the affidavit, we are forced to rely in this case on after-the-fact reconstruction based on a police officer's testimony approximately one year later in the proceedings related to the motion to suppress the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.649" offset="8096761">That evidence shows as follows: that the police officers with the wrong warrant form in hand went to the magistrate's home on a Sunday afternoon; that they knew of the problems with the warrant form at that time and, in fact, they told the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.686" offset="8200937">They said,</text>
            <text syncTime="2014.177" offset="8202923">"We have the wrong form. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2015.699" offset="8208983">"Something will have to be done about this. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.020" offset="8218283">The magistrate locked at it, and he acknowledged that this was the wrong form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.963" offset="8238031">He said that, in the police officer's words, he would adjust the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2030.920" offset="8269901">That is all that is in the record about what the magistrate told the police officers about this changes in the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.442" offset="8299994">There is nothing in the record about telling them what the scope of their authority was or that he would grant full approval for the search that they had described in the application.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.122" offset="8350671">The officers then took that warrant, and the State concedes today that it was never read.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.340" offset="8403543">They simply put it in their pocket and went out to execute it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2067.892" offset="8417754">Now, let me mention first the question of exigent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.416" offset="8439801">The police obtained the final link of evidence, which they put in their application for the warrant, early on Sunday morning in their interview with the owner of the car where the blood was found on the trunk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.109" offset="8514616">It was shortly after that time that they made a decision to arrest the defendant and to seek a warrant for the search of his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.367" offset="8555680">They made no attempt at that time to locate the defendant who was not at that point at his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.171" offset="8590893">He was at the gaming house where they found him the previous day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.414" offset="8615866">They went to the judge's house sometime early in the middle afternoon still not having, as I understand it, made any attempt to find out where the defendant was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2132.213" offset="8675008">It was only when they returned to the District Two police station that they discovered by asking one of the witnesses that they had interviewed that morning where is the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.133" offset="8726730">He made a telephone call to the gaming house and learned that he was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.966" offset="8742090">So the police knew at least from that point on, at least from the point at which they should have known of the defects in the warrant where the defendant was, that he was not in a position to interfere with a search or to tamper with any evidence they might be seeking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.277" offset="8811262">With respect to the finding of probable cause, there is, of course, nothing in the warrant which reflects a finding of probable cause as to the items which were described in that application, and all that the motion judge found, the trial judge, found in this case was... He found as a fact on the basis of the affidavit that the magistrate found that there was probable cause to search the second floor premises of the house at 42 Deckard Street and the playroom, which was in the basement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2210.215" offset="8987014">That is obvious from the face of the search warrant, which does in the application part of it mention the premises at 42 Deckard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2228.077" offset="9058485">It says 42 Deckard, second and basement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2230.759" offset="9069248">There is a photocopy of the warrant itself which appears on page 74a of the record appendix, which appears as an appendix to Justice Liacos concurring opinion in the Supreme Judicial Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2248.340" offset="9139569">With respect to the marijuana and the question of whether there was probable cause to search for marijuana, we do not concede that there was probable cause to search for marijuana.</text>
            <text syncTime="2263.701" offset="9201009">The only evidence supporting the application for the warrant on that was a statement made by the defendant on Saturday that on Tuesday, some five days before the warrant was executed and three to four days before the murder took place, that the victim and the defendant had gone to his house and before going there they had purchased some marijuana.</text>

            <text syncTime="2916.976" offset="11814090">There is a third reason why there is if not prejudice to the defendant some concern why a warrant, a written warrant, should be required in every case, and that is that as in this case we are trying to determine several years after this event took place what it was that happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2953.420" offset="11959853">The Superior Court had that problem, and now this Court is going to have to determine whether there was probable cause, what the judge said and what the effect of the judge's instructions or comments to the police may be.</text>
            <text syncTime="2970.811" offset="12029444">That raises the possibility if that is an acceptable procedure that in any case where a search warrant is challenged as being defective on its face that the police officers and the prosecution can attempt to bring in additional evidence to go behind the warrant to show that the warrant did not mean what it said and that a search completely different than the search authorized by the warrant was in fact authorized by the magistrate who issued it.</text>
