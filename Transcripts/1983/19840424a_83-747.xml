            <text syncTime="71.550" offset="436880">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.376" offset="452135">This case involves an interpretation of three sentences in the longshoremen's Act which at the time of the injuries in this case was the governing law in the District of Columbia for workers compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.291" offset="531756">These three sentences appear in Sections 904(a) and 905(a) of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.726" offset="553490">WMATA is and has been for many years in overall charge of building the Metro system in the Washington metropolitan area.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.284" offset="595809">It has been doing so pursuant to an interstate compact between the jurisdictions of the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.686" offset="629350">The compact directs WMATA, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, to construct the system, and WMATA as the general contractor subcontracts the construction out to hundreds of subcontractors and thousands of sub-subcontractors at various tiers.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.082" offset="719002">Prior to 1979, each sub at whatever tier purchased its own workers compensation, and this simply proved to be unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.938" offset="774382">The small and minority contracts have trouble getting insurance and competing for the bids.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.263" offset="803639">WMATA was never really certain whether they had secured or not, or whether they were maintaining their insurance, and since the purpose of the Act is to make certain that all employees are covered at all times, WMATA in 1971 introduced the CIP, the coordinated insurance program, or what we call wrap-up.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.675" offset="897366">And this is a single policy for comp, for general liability, for workers' liability, covering every employee at every tier in the entire system.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.591" offset="948984">WMATA did this by being named itself in the policy, and then in order to make sure that all employees are covered, because you obviously couldn't name every employee, by naming every sub as the sub came on board on the policy, and WMATA thereby secured under the Act, and respondents, incidentally, do not deny that we secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.424" offset="1048354">These suits were brought by seven injured employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.016" offset="1074685">Compensation was promptly paid to them under the wrap-up, and then the employees brought these tort suits.</text>

            <text syncTime="239.387" offset="1108226">Mr. Prettyman, does the same situation exist outside the Metropolitan Transit Authority in other construction contracts in areas covered by the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act?</text>

            <text syncTime="254.381" offset="1168204">Let me answer that in two ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.068" offset="1178862">The wrap-up itself is being used extensively throughout the United States in every large project.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.409" offset="1204253">As it affects the longshoremen, Your Honor, it is rather limited, in the sense that there are other statutes that incorporate the Longshoremen's Act, the Defense Base Act, and other statutes, but it does not apply, and also, of course--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="281.073" stopTime="295.395">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="281.073" offset="1274888">But this question would have application beyond the boundaries of the Washington Metropolitan Transit Authority, I assume, in other construction contracts under the Longshoremen and Harbor Workers' Act?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="e_barrett_prettyman_jr" startTime="295.395" stopTime="317.653">
            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="295.395" offset="1332253">--Correct, Your Honor, and it also, of course, would apply in a limited sense in the maritime situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.049" offset="1362868">It would not apply in your traditional vessel owner, stevedoring, longshoremen situation, but it would where different things such as crane operations and so forth were subcontracted out.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="325.415" offset="1452311">Does the use of the wrap-up insurance result in lower premiums overall and lower administrative costs?</text>

            <text syncTime="341.112" offset="1515110">We paid out $177 million in this project in workers comp premiums.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Barrett Prettyman, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="353.904" offset="1566205">I think it is substantially less.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.825" offset="1573938">Certainly cost is a factor here, but I have got to emphasize that the real force behind wrap-up is several things.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.071" offset="1610927">First of all, to impose your safety program on the entire project from the top, and secondly, to make absolutely certain that you are carrying out your duty to have this comp secured at all times, because when you have got subcontractors coming aboard, leaving, some of them may or may not have insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.344" offset="1688040">They have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.094" offset="1690966">Maybe it lapses, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.076" offset="1698907">Monitoring that situation becomes impossible as a practical matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="391.154" offset="1715208">Wrap-up, we have found since '71 is simply the only practical way of doing this.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.651" offset="1741226">All five District Court judges in these seven cases held that WMATA was a general contractor, that since the subs had not secured, that WMATA fulfilled its statutory duty in securing with this policy, that all of the employees had received compensation under the policy, and therefore WMATA was entitled to immunity from tort suit under Section 905(a).</text>

            <text syncTime="441.635" offset="1917186">It gets the immunity as a statutory employer, and it gets it because it had a duty as a contractor to go out and secure, in view of the fact under Section 905(a) that the employer was a... the direct employer was a subcontractor.</text>

            <text syncTime="985.136" offset="4091201">I don't really see that the subs get any quid pro quo benefit out of that, because they are all competing on an equal basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1013.484" offset="4204573">We couldn't even be sued by either the government under the criminal sections or civilly because we hadn't secured, because that relates only to the employer.</text>

            <text syncTime="1750.711" offset="7153484">The issue in this case is whether Metro should be given immunity from third party suits by these respondents despite the plain language of Section 905(a) granting immunity only to employers, and despite the plain language of Section 933(a), preserving the injured employee's right to proceed against any person other than the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.326" offset="7247942">The issue is not, as Metro states, whether Metro must be responsible for both damages in tort and for workers compensation benefits to the respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.775" offset="7289738">The compensation paid to the respondents in these cases were paid by Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Company on behalf of and in the name of the employers who are insured entities under the policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1797.911" offset="7342297">Metro merely voluntarily paid the premium for these coverages in order to save millions of dollars.</text>

            <text syncTime="1812.436" offset="7400393">The statute normally, under the traditional scheme, an employer pays his own premium.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.043" offset="7426829">That hasn't happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.135" offset="7431218">Metro has provided the coverages for the employers, and has informed them under the coordinated insurance program not to submit bids that do not take into account the coordinated insurance program's coverages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1834.379" offset="7488164">Now, as a practical matter, this means that any contractor who has been awarded a contract under Phase 2 has not submitted the cost of workers compensation in his bid.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.080" offset="7534976">He can't, because Metro decides who is going to get the contract, and it usually awards the contract to the low bidder, so that when the contract is awarded, Metro assures itself that the contractor who is given the contract has not secured his own workers compensation insurance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.633" offset="7613134">Now, before I go forward, I would want to make one thing perfectly clear, and that is that it is very much in issue, and the respondents deny that Metro has secured compensation pursuant to its 904(a) duty, and that is for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.610" offset="7677082">Number One, it is that the employer has the primary obligation to secure benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.420" offset="7700279">If the employers herein, the respondents employers, have not secured compensation, and if the coordinated insurance program in fact prevents them from securing compensation, there is something basically flawed about the program itself.</text>

            <text syncTime="2801.197" offset="11355436">He is obligated as a contractor, and the duties imposed by the second sentence of 904(a) are specifically there only because of the relationship that the contractor has with a subcontractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.551" offset="11408831">The contractor is in a position to hire for purposes not consistent with the Act an uninsured subcontractor, so the second sentence a puts duty on him to hire an insured subcontractor or he is going to be held liable himself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2830.873" offset="11474137">It does not entitle the contractor to any immunity that he would otherwise have.</text>
            <text syncTime="2837.526" offset="11500782">All he has to do is hire an insured subcontractor in order to protect the injured employee, and the statute does not accord him any immunity for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2851.223" offset="11555534">There is no evidence in the plain language of Section 33, or Section 905, 933(i), which was amended in 1959, to indicate that the Congress intended the immunities of an employer to extend any further than what the Congress called in 1959 the employer-employee family, and that is very important, because this Act is based on the New York Act; 904(a) is based on Section 56 of the New York statute, and in 1946, the New York Court of Appeals in the Sweezy case held that under no circumstances, whether the contractor has to pay or not pay, is he an employer entitled to immunity within the meaning of the New York statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2899.736" offset="11749572">The Fiori case here under the Longshore Act follows precisely the same rationale as that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.186" offset="11771410">The contractor is not entitled to immunity by virtue of a secondary obligation he has pursuant to the second sentence in 904(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.322" offset="11811952">He is not entitled to it because all the statute does is what the statute does in 937 to a vessel owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.101" offset="11842986">He has to hire an insured contractor, and if he doesn't, the statute is going to hold him responsible.</text>

            <text syncTime="2961.741" offset="11997631">The Act also serves to preserve the employee's common law rights of action which are not specifically eliminated by Section 905(a), and the only remedies that the injured worker has that are eliminated by the statute by its clear terms are those that he had at common law against the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.216" offset="12095538">Now, wrap-up insurance should not change the legal liabilities or the obligations or the rights between any of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.448" offset="12128452">If wrap-up insurance satisfies the statute, it must allow the employers who participate in it, what Metro calls their subcontractors, to secure compensation coverage.</text>
            <text syncTime="3009.426" offset="12188324">By instituting an insurance plan that saves them money, they should not be able to cloak themselves with the immunity of an employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3020.374" offset="12232106">It goes beyond the plain purpose of the Act in permitting the injured worker his common law remedies against anybody but the employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.761" offset="12261676">In 1972, the Congress amended the Act and indicated a number of things that are relevant to the inquiry here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3042.880" offset="12322176">First, the Congress specifically declined the opportunity to extend the immunity of an employer any further than the plain language indicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.265" offset="12367733">There were bills passed or pending in front of Congress at that time to extend the immunity of an employer to a vessel, making the vessel and the stevedore joint employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.371" offset="12420083">The rejected that, and indicated specifically the beneficial purpose of allowing the injured employee to proceed against a third party at common law, because it encouraged safety.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.615" offset="12469089">Another consideration is, Congress indicated it wanted the vessel owner to be in precisely the same situation as a third party would be in a land-based setting, indicating that Congress was aware of the case law under the District of Columbia Act allowing the injured worker the right to proceed against the general contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.684" offset="12561353">There is no question that the case law has been unanimous in allowing suits by subcontractor employees against the general contractor, despite the fact that 904(a) imposes a secondary obligation on the contractor to secure compensation in the event that his own employer fails to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.112" offset="12655080">In these cases, Metro has preempted the obligation of the employers to secure compensation if in fact the Metro wrap-up plan does not satisfy the obligations of the employer to secure compensation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3145.447" offset="12732403">The respondents submit that the employers have secured compensation by participating in this plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.008" offset="12758630">Metro hasn't secured it merely by purchasing it for the benefit of the employers who are under a statutory obligation to secure it in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3163.286" offset="12803769">In fact, there is an important reason why Metro should be denied immunity and that is because by purchasing the premium they have tended to undermine safety in the work place.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.029" offset="12874718">Congress indicated in 1972, as I stated earlier, that the employer should shoulder the burden of the premium payment in order for him to have an interest in safe conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3195.023" offset="12930724">When Metro instituted this program in 1971, precisely the opposite thing happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="3201.036" offset="12954757">The contractors who were insured entities had no interest in getting the work done, and we are talking about very dangerous work.</text>
            <text syncTime="3209.018" offset="12986731">We are talking about tunneling.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.986" offset="12994568">We are talking about underground mining.</text>
            <text syncTime="3213.031" offset="13002718">And the contractors, by not having the right to have their premium reduced, by having no rebate system, they lost the incentive, resulting in higher losses than what ordinarily have occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="3227.432" offset="13060396">Metro has indicated that this is true by virtue of the fact that in June of 1978, to replace that incentive, they had to institute a safety awareness program which was a system of bonuses for contractors who had better safety records, to--</text>
