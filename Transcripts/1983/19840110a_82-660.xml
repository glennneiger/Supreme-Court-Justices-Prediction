            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="9.560" offset="187753">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="16.916" offset="217219">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.649" offset="224115">This case and the companion case of Strickland versus Washington concern the circumstances under which an otherwise valid judgment of conviction may be set aside on the basis of asserted defects in district court by defense counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="36.001" offset="293601">This issue is one of substantial importance to the administration of justice in the federal and state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.656" offset="312200">This is so because of the frequency with which such claims are raised and because of the often extended proceedings that some courts have ordered to dispose of those claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.058" offset="353787">All too often, in our view, the courts engaged in a somewhat detached inquiry into the litigating judgments and performance of counsel in the abstract, rather than focusing on what we submit should be the central concern, that is, whether any errors by counsel in turn prejudiced the accused by causing a fundamental defect in the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.970" offset="449395">In order to obtain relief on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel; it is our position that the accused must show errors that fall below the minimum level of competence of counsel; and second, that any such errors in turn had a probable effect on the outcome of the case or otherwise undermine the fundamental fairness of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.351" offset="543018">In this case, the Court of Appeals did not make any such findings in reversing the Respondent's conviction on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.315" offset="578858">In fact, it did not--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="108.300" offset="582724">Mr. Kneedler, I'm troubled in this case by the fact that there are two different types of ineffective assistance of counsel claims: one where the state itself impairs the effective assistance of counsel, either by not appointing counsel at all or by taking some action that would impair the right; a second time is, assuming there's no interference by the court or the state as such with counsel, counsel simply fails to meet whatever standard it is that the court might adopt.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.691" offset="736324">Now, which type of claim was litigated here?</text>

            <text syncTime="151.642" offset="756177">--Well, the principal basis of the claim and the one that the Court of Appeals decided was of the first type that you mentioned.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.592" offset="791913">The Court of Appeals held that, in effect, that it must be conclusively presumed that Respondent's attorney Colston did not have... it was impossible for him to prepare for trial within the 25 days allowed.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="181.037" offset="873728">Now, is that the presentation that was made by the Defendant in this case, the Respondent?</text>
            <text syncTime="189.501" offset="907583">Or did the Respondent argue some other kind?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="192.265" stopTime="212.118">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="192.265" offset="918659">That was the principal claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.437" offset="923361">There were passing allegations of inadequacies in the actual performance of counsel as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.731" offset="960455">There were some general assertions that counsel never objected to any evidence, without identifying particular objections.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="212.118" offset="998071">In your view, did the Court of Appeals resolve only the first type of claim?</text>

            <text syncTime="217.069" offset="1017820">The Court of Appeals plainly resolved only the first, because the Court noted the Government's objection that in fact Respondent had not identified any specific failings by counsel.</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="227.300" offset="1058780">I believe it's not here in its entirety, largely because most of the specific failings of trial counsel that Respondent points to were never identified in the Court of Appeals, even though there was a claim that counsel in fact had performed inadequately.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.135" offset="1146133">The specificity with which Respondent now claims was just not reflected in the record.</text>

            <text syncTime="259.005" offset="1185630">No, as to the second type it's our position that the appropriate procedure would be for Respondent to raise any claims about specific defects in counsel's performance in a motion under 2255, because this was--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="275.437" offset="1251354">That was, I think, the premise of the question.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="278.577" stopTime="280.341">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="280.341" offset="1270894">That allegations of specific defects be raised under 2255, largely because they are often thought, and usually do, arise from things outside the record, so it would often be necessary to make a record, and in any event to have the trial court in the first instance to take an assessment of the impact of any errors by counsel.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="302.317" stopTime="311.578">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="302.317" offset="1358874">I don't see how he could do that, Mr. Kneedler, unless we're to adopt a flat rule that assistance of counsel claims can't be raised on direct appeal.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="311.578" stopTime="334.256">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="311.578" offset="1395864">Well, if the claim can be raised on direct appeal and resolved on the basis of the record created, then there would be an appropriate occasion to dispose of the case in that instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.352" offset="1455005">But if it would require an extensive hearing, that's not the sort of thing that would ordinarily be part of a direct appeal.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="334.256" stopTime="363.463">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="334.256" offset="1486561">But in this particular case, supposing that the Respondent argued in the Court of Appeals specific failings and the Court of Appeals just felt they didn't have to get to that because of the shortness of time which counsel had and his lack of experience.</text>
            <text syncTime="349.470" offset="1547478">Then if we decided that was wrong, why wouldn't we send it back to the Court of Appeals, if we didn't decide the other issues ourselves, to let them consider things that had been properly raised before them in the first instance?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="edwin_s_kneedler" startTime="363.463" stopTime="416.364">
            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="363.463" offset="1603381">Well, if there were specific errors that the Court of Appeals could dispose of by assessing the record, then that would be appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.147" offset="1642146">Part of this ties into our submission on the merits, though, as well, and that is that the essential part of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is not counsel's performance in the abstract, but how it affects the conduct of the trial and the rights of the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.499" offset="1719573">And so what the court would be doing on direct appeal, what we submit it should be doing, is determining whether the errors by counsel amounted to plain error of the type that would warrant relief on the basis of those errors themselves, without regard to whether counsel had caused them or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.319" offset="1786865">So on direct appeal, if counsel is said to have committed a plain... or caused a plain error to result--</text>

            <text syncTime="821.012" offset="3433624">There was another attorney, Mr. Rivas, who appeared with him, and according to an affidavit filed by the Government in the Court of Appeals Mr. Rivas had extensive prior experience in criminal cases.</text>

            <text syncTime="846.470" offset="3535397">Now, one other factor Respondent does mention in this Powell-type argument suggests or asserts broadly that mail fraud, which is what we had here, is an arcane and complex area of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.056" offset="3617735">But that generalization simply won't stand up.</text>
            <text syncTime="869.914" offset="3629229">There are simply two elements to the offense: one is the existence of a scheme to defraud; and the other is the use of the mails to accomplish the scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="876.410" offset="3655247">Here there is no dispute about the use of the mails in the scheme, and the scheme itself was a simple one.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.424" offset="3679279">It involved check-kiting, which this Court described in simple terms just two terms ago in Williams versus United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.077" offset="3709895">It involves the Defendant taking advantage of the float created when checks are sent back and forth from one bank to another.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.151" offset="3742182">The mechanics of that sort of scheme would not be difficult for any attorney or anyone who maintains a checking account to figure out.</text>
            <text syncTime="908.242" offset="3782515">There were a number of transactions in this case, but they were part of one overall similar course of conduct, and the defense counsel had available to him the full records in the case and in fact a reconciliation of the accounts of the banks by his company's own CPA that disclosed that the bank in Oklahoma had lost a half a million dollars or that there was a net overdraft of a half million dollars.</text>
            <text syncTime="938.449" offset="3903410">Respondent does not dispute any of those facts regarding the sending of checks back and forth or the net overdraft that resulted, and he concedes in his brief that there was overwhelming evidence of his control of the company involved and that he directed the check-cashing activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="986.553" offset="4095776">But the business involved here... there was testimony at trial that there was just $150,000 a year annual sales.</text>

            <text syncTime="998.486" offset="4143527">And yet, there were $5 million deposited in the two accounts over a period of four months, the checks going back and forth without any, even to this day, explanation of what sort of legitimate banking practice would have been going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.153" offset="4202146">I think in these circumstances for Respondent to suggest that if there was a swindler it was the Norman Bank is unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.117" offset="4234016">And in fact, although Respondent contends that the bank ultimately recovered the proceeds and that there was no fraud, that's also beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1032.067" offset="4277797">First of all, it's not necessary that a scheme to defraud be successful under the mail fraud statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.220" offset="4294411">But in any event, the facts here just do not establish that the bank was repaid, much less that it was repaid voluntarily by Respondent in a way that could refute the existence of criminal intent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1133.353" offset="4683008">And I should reiterate: He had the assistance of another attorney who in fact was experienced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1138.882" offset="4705056">Another point that I would like to make in this regard is that an attorney who does not have extensive prior experience in a criminal case will often compensate for that lack of experience by unusual or atypical zeal in preparing the case and doing perhaps more research and more preparation than another lawyer might do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.684" offset="4800350">Perhaps he would have more time to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.793" offset="4808710">But in any event, we submit that it would be illogical under the Sixth Amendment to set aside a conviction on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel solely on the basis of counsel's experience when... or if that attorney performed in exactly the same way an experienced lawyer would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="1183.706" offset="4884360">In those circumstances there could be no claim that the right to effective assistance of counsel had been abridged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1192.922" offset="4921245">The last point I'd like to make on this, the first prong of Respondent's argument in this case under Powell, is that the Court of Appeals' approach in this case seems to us to be directly contrary to the Court's decision last term in Morris versus Slappy, in which the Court recognized that the scheduling of trials presents a considerable problem for district courts and that the court's scheduling of a trial will not be set aside except in the face of an arbitrary action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1224.473" offset="5047469">And in these circumstances, where the court in fact granted the continuance rather than denying it, as in Morris versus Slappy, we think it follows clearly that there is no basis for setting aside the conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.324" offset="5110894">Basically what the Tenth Circuit has done in this case, then, is simply to second-guess the district court's ruling on a continuance under the guise of adopting a five-part balancing test on the ineffective assistance of counsel, and we think that that's inconsistent with the approach in Morris.</text>
            <text syncTime="1264.174" offset="5206293">I would also like to briefly address Respondent's second argument in this case, going to allegations of specific defects in attorney Colston's performance at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1279.231" offset="5266479">As I mentioned before, most of these specific claims were not raised in the Court of Appeals, including the claim of a lack of criminal intent, and we therefore don't think it would be necessary for this Court to review the record and go through all of the myriad claims that Respondent has raised for the first time to determine whether there has actually been a specific error.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.580" offset="5367834">We have addressed several of those claims in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1308.922" offset="5385284">But we do think in this case that the nature of the claims Respondent is making is instructive and in fact vividly illustrates the problems that will be created if this Court does not adopt a test as to reviewing claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that requires a look to see whether there was a fundamental defect in the proceedings that resulted from the attorney's actions, rather than looking at the attorney's actions in their own right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.021" offset="5493640">What Respondent has done is to comb the record to second-guess the counsel's performance as if the purpose were to grade the lawyer, rather than to see what happened to the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1348.906" offset="5545154">And I think it's important to stress that there are a number of difficulties with this approach, a number of things that should give a court pause before it engages in this sort of post hoc review of counsel's litigating strategy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.213" offset="5606385">First, it requires an unseemly probing in many cases of the lawyer's thought processes and communications with his client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.693" offset="5644314">In the long term, this could have a very disheartening effect for defense counsel, knowing that they would be routinely exposed in their litigating judgments to scrutiny after the trial, and this could have the effect of deferring people from accepting appointments in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1392.122" offset="5718084">Secondly, the nature of the inquiry is in some respects as perversion of the adversary process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.730" offset="5744520">A hearing such as that required to determine why the lawyer did what when has the effect of putting the lawyer in the awkward position of defending himself, while not wanting to undermine his client's claim for relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1413.099" offset="5801990">And at the same time it puts the prosecutor in the position of defending his former adversary's actions, to say that they were reasonable and effective.</text>
            <text syncTime="1423.204" offset="5842427">Third, it's often a highly subjective inquiry, because it requires predictions about the state of the law, what the attorney perceived in the case at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.558" offset="5895821">Fourth, it undermines the independence of defense counsel, independence that this Court held just two terms ago in Polk County is constitutionally mandated; that once the lawyer is freed of the external restraints that Justice O'Connor referred to, that is effectively the assistance of counsel to which the Sixth Amendment refers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1458.988" offset="5985474">But under a rule that did not require a substantial showing, the result could be to have courts and prosecutors oversee defense counsel's actions at trial in order to prevent the conviction from later being set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1474.792" offset="6048690">And also, under our adversary system, the heart of it, the premise of it, is that the attorney, either retained or appointed, who assumes responsibility in a criminal case, is, as the Court said in Polk County, performing an essentially private function, and the integrity of the adversary process depends on the presumption that the attorney will perceive his duties and will conscientiously perform them according to his ethical responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.905" offset="6165196">So the Court should give effect to that presumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="1508.075" offset="6181914">And last, to have too quick an inquiry into counsel's actual performance would detract from the trial itself, because our adversary system attaches finality to a judgment of conviction and it presupposes that a trial of the Defendant himself will not automatically be followed by a trial of the attorney, as Justice Brennan observed in his dissenting opinion in Wainright versus Sykes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.581" offset="6287867">Therefore, we believe a substantial showing should be made before these sorts of inquiries are made, and in our view the appropriate objective criterion for this is whether there is a substantial defect in the proceedings that resulted from counsel's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.042" offset="6361741">This is an anchor, something rooted in the proceedings themselves, rather than in counsel's actions, to be guided by the Court... to guide the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.772" offset="6404687">It must be remembered that a party in litigation cannot ordinarily get a valid judgment set aside by saying his attorney made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.128" offset="6438123">The usual relief that a client has in those circumstances is against his attorney for malpractice, not to set aside a conviction and impose the burdens on his opponent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1584.654" offset="6488174">And we suggest... and in that malpractice action, the client would have to show more than that the lawyer didn't perform reasonably; he'd have to show that there was some prejudice as a result and in fact, under malpractice law, that the client would have prevailed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.039" offset="6549718">We suggest that a similar showing of prejudice is appropriate where what the lawyer seeks is to... or what the Defendant seeks is to have his conviction set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.064" offset="6605830">This follows also from the text of the Sixth Amendment and the decision in Gideon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.515" offset="6631638">The text of the Sixth Amendment refers to the assistance of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.905" offset="6645222">If counsel is denied or effectively denied, as in Powell, then a conviction is set aside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.557" offset="6675838">But where the claim is that the lawyer committed specific errors, it's our submission that those errors must be of comparable severity, comparable seriousness or gravity to an outright denial of counsel in order for relief to be granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.270" offset="6742607">And because the purpose of the Sixth Amendment, as stated in Gideon and other cases, is to guarantee the fairness of the proceedings, the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, we suggest that the inquiry therefore is whether counsel's errors affected the fairness of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1668.261" offset="6822646">This is reflected in this Court's decision in McMann versus Richardson 13 years ago, which addresses this area, in which the focus of the Court's concern was not simply on how the lawyer performed, but what effect it had on the client.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.443" offset="6879384">Did it render his guilty plea an unintelligent act?</text>
            <text syncTime="1688.159" offset="6902163">If so, then few would dispute that the conviction resting on that sort of guilty plea would be unfair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.345" offset="6926927">It also directly corresponds to this Court's decision in Agurs, where the Court said that the purpose of the inquiry is not to find fault or to award relief on the basis of fault of the prosecutor, the other attorney in the case, but to guarantee fairness to the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.431" offset="6991292">By the same token, we think where the defense counsel's conduct has fallen into Question that same parallel applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.771" offset="7032670">I'd like to reserve the balance of my time.</text>

            <text syncTime="1732.641" offset="7080109">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.625" offset="7092021">In its main brief in this case, the Government argues that this was a case of unimpaired counsel and that the issue before the Court is the appropriate test for relief of an unimpaired counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1756.413" offset="7175194">Now Mr. Kneedler concedes the decision below was based on quite different considerations, namely judicial impairments in counsel's ability to prepare and present the case, and that is the case, that is the decision below, and that is the case before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1779.170" offset="7266205">Of course, Powell against Alabama is distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1785.886" offset="7293059">But the basic principle of Powell against Alabama applies in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.008" offset="7317614">The Court in Powell said that the court's obligation to appoint counsel is not discharged by a formal appointment, but the appointment must be made at such time and under such circumstances as will enable the giving of effective aid in the preparation and the trial of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.124" offset="7410087">That obligation was not discharged by the trial judge.</text>

            <text syncTime="1899.277" offset="7746649">It seems to me, particularly in the case of an inexperienced lawyer, Mr. Colston might well have concluded that the judgment, the final judgment on the question of a trial date, had been made.</text>

            <text syncTime="1966.860" offset="8016964">For example, in most federal courts I think it is most unusual for counsel to come in on the day set for trial and get a continuance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1982.603" offset="8079972">Now, what in effect the trial judge did was impose upon the defense and on Mr. Colston particularly the obligation of in 25 days learning the Rules of Evidence, learning the Rules of Criminal Procedure, learning the principles of criminal law, learning how to try a case, understanding thousands of documents, fitting those documents into the framework of a defense, and interviewing or attempting to interview two dozen witnesses that were scattered throughout the southern states.</text>

            <text syncTime="3752.026" offset="15157692">Yes, several points, Mr. Chief Justice, thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3755.494" offset="15171590">First with respect to the discussion during Mr. Duke's argument about what the client may have told the attorney, I think that issue is highly relevant, as is... and Respondent concedes this, too... the information that counsel receives from the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3774.361" offset="15247031">In this case the investigative file is relevant as to counsels' duty in the circumstances of the case, his professional obligation to assess... after all, that's what counsel's for, to assess the circumstances facing the Defendant and try to make some judgment as to what's worth pursuing and what isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="3791.183" offset="15314323">And again, I think it's useful to draw on the analogy in the Agurs decision, where the Court determined the materiality of the evidence that should have been turned over to the defense in terms of how it would have appeared to the prosecutor, its materiality, the weight of whether it was a close case or not a close case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3810.207" offset="15390391">We think precisely the same rule applies with respect to judging defense counsel's performance, including the weight of the Government's case, and that's the very reason why we believe it is appropriate in judging the element of prejudice in a case like this to see whether in fact what the lawyer would have done would have had any effect on the outcome, given all the circumstances of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3833.652" offset="15484118">And in this case, I submit that, while Mr. Duke has come up with a defense that might be theoretically plausible, to suggest that this sort of defense in the circumstances of this case would have had any effect on the jury's determination of Respondent's guilt or innocence is, we submit, quite incredible.</text>
