            <label>Mr. Melvyn R. Leventhal</label>
            <text syncTime="11.206" offset="197165">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, in this case the state of New York challenges a fee award entered against it under a fee shifting statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.663" offset="243036">An award of approximately $150 an hour, consisting of a $100 base rate and a 50 percent multiplier, was granted three young attorneys with an average experience of two years when comparable attorneys working for major Wall Street firms were being billed to commercial clients at the rate of $70 an hour.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.695" offset="339166">The question presented is whether $150 an hour for attorneys without any billing experience and working for non-profit organizations is reasonable, and more specifically, what standards and procedures should control the inquiry, and what standards and procedures were not followed by the District Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.394" offset="425997">The critical theme in our argument derives from the fact that we are proceeding under a fee shifting statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.850" offset="467793">That is the one aspect of the case that permeates our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="83.904" offset="487960">The state of New York did not enter the marketplace to hire an attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="87.772" offset="503529">There was no competition among lawyers for our business.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.676" offset="519098">We didn't negotiate an hourly rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.076" offset="528711">We never reviewed their time records before the bill was submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.914" offset="544071">We never monitored their work.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.449" offset="554206">We didn't develop a relationship of trust with plaintiff's counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.817" offset="571656">Two years after the litigation began, plaintiffs moved for an award of attorneys' fees, and the District Court has ordered us to pay every nickel requested by the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.808" offset="623587">Because we are working under a fee shifting principle, the District Court has a duty to probe deeply into the fee application of plaintiff's counsel, and because we have a fee shifting statute, the standards and procedures that must be developed by this court must recognize that the state of New York is a captive payor.</text>

            <text syncTime="149.179" offset="749080">Mr. Leventhal, that is true of any fee shifting statute, isn't it?</text>
            <text syncTime="153.381" offset="765903">I mean, Section 1988 isn't the first statute that has ever been passed by a legislature saying that the losing party pays the winning party's attorney's fees.</text>

            <label>Mr. Melvyn R. Leventhal</label>
            <text syncTime="162.587" offset="802787">--That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.439" offset="806131">The principle applies in every fee shifting statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="166.323" offset="817730">The difficult question presented is how should the hourly rate be calculated for attorneys without relevant billing experience, who don't have a normal billing rate, who work for profit and non-profit law firms.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.317" offset="881677">There have been developed three approaches to this question in our judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.304" offset="901635">The first is a fictional market approach adopted by the District Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.458" offset="930265">It is almost a fanciful approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.410" offset="942072">Under it, the court asks for information on awards granted in other civil rights cases or in other cases that the court finds comparable.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.782" offset="987525">When it does so, it doesn't ask whether there was any information, any evidence submitted in those case which establish what the market rate is, and in fact the court below, by way of illustration, relied upon Becker versus Blum, a case in which the District Court awarded $75 an hour for lawyers with less than two years' experience and $90 an hour for lawyers with more than two years' experience, without any evidence of what the market rate is.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.403" offset="1109987">And in fact, in that case, the only comment of the District Court was that the Legal Services Corporation should have asked for more, but there was no evidence in the case of what is in fact a market rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.895" offset="1159934">We therefore view it as entirely fictional.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.080" offset="1172681">The second approach--</text>

            <text syncTime="266.554" offset="1218657">--Your Honor, we raised in the lower court a claim that the fee award was exorbitant, and we argued in the Second Circuit for the first time that hourly rates should be based upon costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.528" offset="1262543">But throughout this litigation we have argued for... under different theories that whatever the rate granted to the plaintiff's counsel in this case, it was excessive.</text>

            <text syncTime="300.026" offset="1352508">Did you not have an opportunity to have discovery on the time records?</text>

            <text syncTime="610.753" offset="2595414">First, there is a profit component in a market rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.305" offset="2613596">Based upon an appreciation of the risks a business assumed, to create a long relationship with clients, to develop a business over many years.</text>

            <text syncTime="640.003" offset="2712443">Secondly, there is an overhead component in the market rate that we think results in windfalls, in excessive awards.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.676" offset="2743059">The overhead component might be appropriate for a major Wall Street firm that has huge dollars at stake in a controversy, in a litigated matter, and is impelled by the demands of its client to provide unusual services.</text>

            <text syncTime="709.916" offset="2992058">That cost based approach is the one I described to you, Mr. Justice Marshall, entailing a component reflecting the value of the attorney plus some overhead.</text>

            <text syncTime="723.323" offset="3045661">It is in touch with the reality of a non-profit organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.541" offset="3062588">It achieves moderation, which we believe is required by the Congress under this fee shifting statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="733.762" offset="3087457">We believe it will attract competent counsel, and at the same time protect against the windfall element in the market rate approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.285" offset="3121521">The calculation, to give you an easy example of it, if an attorney with two years' experience at the Legal Aid Society could have made $48,000 at a private firm, and billed 1,600 hours a year... I would use 2,000, Your Honor, but my notes show 1,600... that would produce a 30-hour rate for that attorney, and it would reflect the value of that attorney had he sold his services to a private firm.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.237" offset="3241370">If at the same time the non-profit organization had overhead of $5 million, and it employed 100 lawyers, then we could estimate the overhead per hour attributable to that lawyer as approximately $30 or $31 an hour, leading to an hourly rate of $60 or $61 an hour.</text>

            <text syncTime="884.811" offset="3691617">As the Copeland court recognized in its very brief discussion of this market rate, that inquiry could be very intrusive because it can require documentation, it could require what the court referred to as other submissions, and it can require a hearing, and a very complex hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="903.974" offset="3768312">In a recent decision, this Ramos versus Lamb decision, the Tenth Circuit noted that the plaintiffs in that case sought a fee award of approximately $700,000, $700,000, $800,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.750" offset="3835395">The experts produced in that case disagreed to the tune of $500,000 on what a reasonable market rate would be for those attorneys.</text>

            <text syncTime="1494.015" offset="6128423">When we look at this private practitioner, it is of great concern to the state that we do look at his overhead, and that there be differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="1509.358" offset="6189863">The fact is, we have fee applications pending against the state of New York right now where attorneys have worked out of their homes, or attorneys have worked out of a one-room office with a telephone answering machine, and they are seeking fees that might be identical to a lawyer with substantially more overhead.</text>
            <text syncTime="1526.819" offset="6259663">It is relevant that their overhead is substantially less than other lawyers working downtown.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.406" offset="6289965">We are also concerned that lawyers look to obtain their highest opportunity fee when they bill the state of New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.781" offset="6335522">The fact is that lawyers don't operate that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.900" offset="6347956">The fact is that lawyers charge different hourly rates at different times and for different clients, and we think it is unreasonable for an attorney to be seeking a fee based upon the highest fee he has ever recovered, or the highest hourly rate he has ever billed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1562.909" offset="6404067">The critical arguments raised by the opposition are that Congress intended that the fee awards be in our judgment unreasonable, that the fee awards not be measured by neutral principles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1585.423" offset="6494033">They argue that rigidity is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1588.727" offset="6507303">We think that is inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.012" offset="6520469">Secondly, they don't argue that cost based rates are unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1598.082" offset="6544711">There is not a whisper in their brief that costs are irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.867" offset="6559862">They simply say that costs are too complicated and too intrusive, when in fact the evidence shows that they are no more complicated and no more intrusive than the alternative market rates.</text>

            <text syncTime="1623.364" offset="6645857">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court, I would like before launching into my argument to have some general principles up front.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.348" offset="6745749">One is the result of this lawsuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.919" offset="6768110">In this case, 114,000 persons over a 35-month period were illegally deprived of their Medicaid benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.077" offset="6820668">If one makes a modest assumption that each of those persons who had been kicked off the roles illegally was off the roles for just one month, then... and if you make the further assumption, which is mathematically computable by one of the appendixes in our lodgement, that the average monthly cost is $100 per person, then the class was deprived of $317,000 a month, or $3,500,000 a year, and the Society gained for its clients $3,500,000 a year for the indefinite future.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.444" offset="7034141">The fee here awarded was $117,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.650" offset="7066951">Now, I am not suggesting that there be some mathematical relationship, but I recall Judge Wilke in the minority in Copeland saying that there $30,000 had been achieved and wasn't it terrible that there the attorneys were going to get a fee substantially in excess of the $30,000 that the clients had realized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.569" offset="7182621">That consideration is not, I suggest, in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.806" offset="7203623">To dispose of another matter which Justice O'Connor alluded to in her question, I would like to take the liberty of reading a short paragraph from the state's brief that was submitted to Judge Sweet, who is the District Court judge who set the fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.768" offset="7279483">The state says,</text>
            <text syncTime="1784.684" offset="7291081">"The starting point in the determination of a fee award is calculation of the time the attorney has expended on the case multiplied by an hourly rate which is determined by the amount to which attorneys of like skill in the area would typically be entitled for a given type of work on the basis of an hourly rate of compensation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.620" offset="7398915">"The result of this computation is the lodestar amount. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.088" offset="7416783">The state invited Judge Sweet to use that analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1996.887" offset="8139956">The factual predicate upon which this Court is now being asked to change the traditional and, I submit, Congressionally mandated method for the setting of fees under 1988, that factual predicate is absolutely non-existent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.320" offset="8233684">In our lodgement with the Court, in Appendix 3, we have tried to make a meticulous analysis of the cases that have arisen under 1988 which appear in the pocket parts, and we have tried fairly to chart them in a way that is meaningful for the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2041.583" offset="8318739">It is my submission that that demonstrates, that factual determination from the way the courts have applied 1988 shows that they have been moderate and reasonable in amounts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.445" offset="8386134">They have exercised their discretion as the Congress intended them to, and they have done so reasonably by using the prevailing rates in the community approach.</text>
            <text syncTime="2070.419" offset="8434095">Now, it is right, as Mr. Justice White suggested, that the point of this appeal is the legislative history, and I have... I am willing to confront that because I welcome that analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="3591.962" offset="14520208">When attorneys duplicate time, the courts have authorized downward adjustments for that duplication of rough percentages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.218" offset="14553227">When attorneys don't maintain contemporaneous time records, the Court has said there can be rough adjustments.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.972" offset="14580290">Last term, in Hensley, this Court authorized a 30 percent adjustment for failure to maintain contemporaneous time records.</text>

            <text syncTime="3616.194" offset="14617174">Last term the Court said that when a party does not prevail on all claims there can be a downward adjustment of the hourly rate and the award.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.119" offset="14656881">No one talked about precision in figuring out exactly, mathematically, or with cost accounting the extent to which a claimant, an attorney lost or won a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.074" offset="14696691">This Court expressly held that the downward adjustment was fully at the option of the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3641.711" offset="14719261">We have had downward adjustment authorized for inefficiency, without mathematical precision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3695.880" offset="14935868">Your Honor, in the last... in the Willowbrook case Judge Newman, speaking for the court, talked about a breakpoint, a way of accommodating costs without a rough calculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3709.690" offset="14991143">He said that we can estimate a $75 hourly rate as including costs that might be appropriate for a smaller firm or for a non-profit organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="3721.597" offset="15038791">Let me add, too, that when Mr. Silverman said that the rates for a first year associate are $65 to $85, that is not a market rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3729.684" offset="15071078">That is his rate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3737.690" offset="15103156">Have we ever tried to calculate a market rate based upon the entire spectrum of the marketplace?</text>
            <text syncTime="3744.277" offset="15129488">No court has ever tried that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3746.062" offset="15136593">But if you want to get a true market rate, that is what is required.</text>
            <text syncTime="3749.514" offset="15150490">How would we calculate that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3751.199" offset="15157178">Let me go to this question of the contingency adjustment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.020" offset="15180479">It might very well be that the underlying hourly rate should include some element for contingency that is far different from increasing an award by 50 percent because of a contingency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3771.494" offset="15238366">Perhaps the hourly rate might reflect some consideration of contingency.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.815" offset="15259682">There are other parts of the upward adjustment made by the District Court that are more obviously inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3784.520" offset="15290507">The court said that there was an upward adjustment because of complexity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3788.722" offset="15307330">Last term the Court said that those upward adjustments are often subsumed in the underlying award.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.561" offset="15334601">This is an excellent example of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3797.495" offset="15342334">This Court granted an hourly rate, saying the case was complex.</text>
            <text syncTime="3802.065" offset="15360619">He allowed a number of hours expended on the grounds that it was complex, and then he tripled it, forced the state to pay a third time for complexity, by saying that there is an upward adjustment for complexity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3814.940" offset="15412133">Three times complexity was included in the hourly rate and the total award.</text>
