            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="153467">We'll hear arguments next in Richardson against United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="9.988" offset="193382">We'll just wait until the gallery clears, Counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.043" offset="473624">Mr. Palmer, I think you may proceed when you're ready.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Allan M. Palmer</label>
            <text syncTime="103.758" offset="568396">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="107.481" offset="583338">We're going to first direct our attention to the appealability issue and for... in discussing that I am going to assume for the moment, but only the moment, that we have raised a valid double jeopardy claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="125.844" offset="656794">Now the government disputes the appealability of this claim under Abney on the theory that the so-called second prong of the Cohen test is not met.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.292" offset="710607">The government suggests that because we address the merits of the claim it's not collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.077" offset="741745">Now realistically it would appear to us that we have both been circling the issue and it was only recently that... in the Flanagan case that Justice O'Conner brought us back, I believe, to the original understanding of the matter, and it is this: In the Flanagan case the Court said it is not collateral if it's not independent of the issues to be tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.799" offset="868595">Its validity cannot be adequately reviewed until the trial is complete.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.970" offset="889284">And again in MacDonald, discussing the speedy trial claim, the Court said</text>
            <text syncTime="190.916" offset="917078">"there needs to be a divorce between the claim and the events at trial. "</text>
            <text syncTime="194.947" offset="933170">To us this boils down to the following: that if there be no need to look at the events of trial to determine the claim, it is indeed collateral.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.617" offset="991893">And in this case the trial, of course, is something we seek to avoid.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.632" offset="1011955">We have an extant record of the first trial, which, we say, shows clear insufficiency of the evidence, and that is why the Chief Justice in Abney said that the very nature of a double jeopardy claim such that it is collateral and independent to the principal issues to be tried, and we think in that light there is no question but all three prongs of the Cohen test have been met.</text>
            <text syncTime="245.831" offset="1136716">Now--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="248.032" offset="1145493">Now Abney came up in a somewhat different posture than this case, didn't it?</text>

            <text syncTime="253.408" offset="1167018">Your Honor, unquestionably, but the posture in which it arose does not change the operable principles as to the Cohen factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="268.527" offset="1227518">We still have... we're assuming now a double jeopardy violation.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="273.330" offset="1246744">But why do you have to assume the validity of your claim in order to determine its appealability?</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan M. Palmer</label>
            <text syncTime="278.953" offset="1269209">--Well, because if it's not a double jeopardy violation, we're out of court.</text>
            <text syncTime="283.207" offset="1286241">There's no interlocutory appeal.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="284.817" offset="1292719">Yes, but presumably you'll never know whether there is a double jeopardy violation until you get a determination on the merits on appeal.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="294.514" offset="1331485">I mean, there's a circularity about it, I suppose, from both sides.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="allan_m_palmer" startTime="297.246" stopTime="329.326">
            <label>Mr. Allan M. Palmer</label>
            <text syncTime="297.246" offset="1342352">--Well, as we indicated, it's a self-determining claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.228" offset="1354368">When you say the insufficiency of the evidence, when the government fails at a criminal trial to prove enough to go to the jury, we say that raises a collateral bar, that it has no right to a second bite of the apple.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.068" offset="1421660">Now indeed in determining that, the same claim of insufficiency, you must look at the record, the evidence adduced, to determine whether or not the violation has occurred, but that is separate.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="329.326" stopTime="345.597">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="329.326" offset="1470770">But that assumes a view of the law of double jeopardy that is certainly not necessarily represented by any of this Court's opinions.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.041" offset="1501594">I mean, it may be that so long as it's a hung jury the jeopardy simply has not ceased to attach.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="allan_m_palmer" startTime="345.597" stopTime="389.115">
            <label>Mr. Allan M. Palmer</label>
            <text syncTime="345.597" offset="1535763">Well, that gets us to the next question, whether it is double jeopardy or not, whether there is jeopardy, and that's why I assumed for the first argument that it was, because the government now makes the claim that it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.394" offset="1579021">Now... but I think if it is double jeopardy, if we have a right to avoid a retrial if the evidence was insufficient at the first trial, then I think Abney clearly applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.643" offset="1628027">All three prongs of the test are clearly met.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.074" offset="1641715">Now I think the question that Your Honor is addressing is you have trouble with visualizing or conceptualizing this as a true double jeopardy claim, and that takes us to the next question.</text>

            <text syncTime="406.998" offset="1781418">Its determination, whether we're right or wrong, will vary with whether or not you consider the evidence insufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.442" offset="1819139">But when you say the evidence at the first trial, the government did not produce enough evidence to support a conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.309" offset="1850695">We're saying that it has no right at the second bite of the apple.</text>

            <label>Mr. Allan M. Palmer</label>
            <text syncTime="439.997" offset="1913389">Well, I think Burks supplies us with an underpinning to make that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.043" offset="1933555">Every Court of Appeals that has considered it has said that, in a mistrial context, that it's double jeopardy.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.097" offset="1965843">They go up on the question well, is it appealable now or later, but they all agree that it is double jeopardy and the government cannot prosecute again.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="462.624" offset="2003877">Well, the Courts of Appeals may agree on that, but I don't think that this Court has certainly resolved the thing one way or the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.567" offset="2035642">Do you mean, Mr. Palmer, that in every case where a jury cannot agree the defendant is dismissed?</text>

            <text syncTime="491.803" offset="2120592">But rare is the case in which you will find a hung jury predicated upon or bottomed upon insufficient evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.260" offset="2166463">We're saying under the Glasser test, Virginia v. Jackson, that where the hung jury is based... is bottomed on a government's prosecution that fails to muster enough evidence to get to the jury and the trial court errs in submitting it, we think in that context the government should have no right to reprosecute because it has failed in its burden of proof.</text>

            <text syncTime="2932.010" offset="11881506">The fact that many courts have found that they are able to reach the issue in the civil context suggests that the question remains open.</text>

            <text syncTime="2979.051" offset="12069588">And our concern with this case is that it provides the opportunity for a notice of appeal to interrupt those processes in virtually every case that ends in a mistrial, because as a matter of practice a motion for judgment of acquittal on the basis of insufficiency of the evidence is made in virtually every criminal case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.358" offset="12170838">And that will then involve the appellate court in what can be a very burdensome operation of reviewing the entire record to find out whether the evidence was sufficient, incidentally an effort which they're going to have to go through upon review of the conviction in the second trial anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.870" offset="12248892">And although the evidence may in minor ways be different, the double expenditure of effort is not one that should be overlooked.</text>
