            <label>Mr. Ronald A. Dion</label>
            <text syncTime="79.328" offset="462215">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="82.670" offset="475590">The sole issue that is being presented today is the scope of the RICO forfeiture statute that was passed by Congress in 1970, in particular, Section 1963(a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="95.915" offset="528566">We will try, in the oral argument, to not get into a bingo contest.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.740" offset="547897">Unfortunately, a lot of the sections in 1962 and 1963 are interrelated.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.894" offset="572556">Most of the argument is going to deal with the interrelationship of those two statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.454" offset="594708">First of all, the simple question is whether or not the term 1963(a)(1) permits the forfeiture of income proceeds and profits of illegal racketeering activity or whether it does no so include it.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.588" offset="675270">The first thing we need to do, of course, is go to the express wording of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.820" offset="692197">As in many of these cases of statutory construction, both the government and the defense have argued that the express wording, as well as the intent of the legislature and the legislative history supports their respective positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.719" offset="759802">If we take a look first at the express wording of 1963(a)(1), it is important to note, as several courts have held... In particular, I would like to bring to this Court's attention the case of United States versus McManigall which was decided after the briefs were filed, which is out of the 7th Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.899" offset="836497">Each of those courts have held that it is of interest that the actual words 1963(a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="185.832" offset="888220">It is important for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.174" offset="897624">One of the reasons that is relied upon that I think is secondary is the inclusion of the words in the C.C.E. Statute 848 which was decided and passed within two weeks of the passage of the RICO statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.888" offset="956452">And, in fact, in that statute in the forfeiture provisions, Congress did in fact specify the forfeiture of proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.242" offset="997934">However, I believe that is secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.522" offset="1007025">I think first we have to look at the actual RICO statute itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.693" offset="1023743">If we take a look at 1962(a)--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="224.362" offset="1042342">Where do we find that, Mr. Dion, in the papers?</text>
            <text syncTime="226.112" offset="1049343">Where do we find 1962(a)?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_a_dion" startTime="229.626" stopTime="601.022">
            <label>Mr. Ronald A. Dion</label>
            <text syncTime="229.626" offset="1063449">--A copy of it is in our Appendix at Appendix 1, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.531" offset="1079018">1962(a) is most illuminating in that in that section Congress did in fact use the term "interest".</text>
            <text syncTime="248.040" offset="1137115">Did in fact use the term "income", and did in fact independently use the word "proceeds".</text>
            <text syncTime="254.991" offset="1164909">Now, the government's argument, at least one of the positions, was that when Congress includes language in one section of the statute and doesn't include it in another section, there must be a reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.439" offset="1214646">We obviously do not disagree with that at all in this context.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.547" offset="1231155">In 1962(a) Congress used the terms C.C.E. statute, when they wished to make it forfeitable, they said it was forfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.072" offset="1289252">The question then comes up to what is the interest included in 1963(a)(1)?</text>
            <text syncTime="296.787" offset="1332093">What are we talking about?</text>
            <text syncTime="298.145" offset="1337526">I would like to first take a shortcut.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.331" offset="1354244">One of the things that the government relies upon is a dictionary definition of the term "interest".</text>
            <text syncTime="307.234" offset="1373888">And, one of the dictionary... not the legal definition, but the common Webster's Dictionary of American Heritage Dictionary definition is that it includes the term "profit".</text>
            <text syncTime="318.512" offset="1419028">I would like the Court to understand what they mean by profit in that definition of the word "interest".</text>
            <text syncTime="326.603" offset="1451315">When you go to a bank and you take out a loan and you pay money to the bank for that privilege, the interest is the profit the bank has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="336.178" offset="1489663">It is not the same context as the dictionary definition in a legal sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.706" offset="1523727">Black's Law Dictionary defines it differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.876" offset="1536475">That is the definition that was used by the Martino dissent, by the Thevis court and by the McManigall court.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.481" offset="1562806">The most general term that can be employed to denote a right, claim, title, or legal share in something.</text>
            <text syncTime="363.603" offset="1599377">This is where a lot of lower courts went out and said, all right, if it is an interest in something, what is the something that we are talking about.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.412" offset="1638561">In a number of the courts, including a new case that was decided by the 10th Circuit since this case was submitted, United States versus Zang, has said, let's us look at the RICO statute in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.657" offset="1691537">What is it that makes the RICO statute different from other criminal statutes?</text>
            <text syncTime="393.075" offset="1717242">What is that we are attempting to punish since obviously this is a form of enhancement?</text>
            <text syncTime="398.292" offset="1738140">It is a form of we take the substantive crime and if they done it more than one time and other elements are there, we now have a new crime which we have construed in 1970 called RICO.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.490" offset="1786937">And, that something in addition is, in fact, the enterprise concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.738" offset="1807835">So, these courts have gone to say that when we talk about an interest in something, the something we are talking about is the enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="424.001" offset="1840958">They then go back and take a look at the actual wording of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.185" offset="1857676">In 1962, and other than in one place in 1963, which is the source of litigation here today, whenever Congress used the term "interest", it said "interest in an enterprise".</text>
            <text syncTime="443.164" offset="1917549">Now, one of the questions the government has raised is why then in 1963(a)(1) does Congress not say interest in an enterprise when in 1963(a)(2) and elsewhere throughout the statute, they say "interest in" and the government conveniently says three or four dots "an enterprise".</text>
            <text syncTime="468.483" offset="2018904">I would submit that the reason that it is included in (a)(2) and not in (2)(1) is what is missing, what those dots represent.</text>
            <text syncTime="477.307" offset="2054117">We would submit that what Congress has already stated throughout the substantive events, that it is an 1963(a) at all, but that the reason they did it in (a)(2) was to make very clear, not that the interest which is forfeitable is the interest in the enterprise, but rather that the security of, claim against, or property or contractual right of any kind affording the source of influence over is modified by the term "any enterprise", since those terms are not used elsewhere in the statute with the said modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.056" offset="2217121">A lot of the courts and some of the Law Review articles condemn the courts for this, then go into a question of legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.224" offset="2257872">And, as with many of these cases, both the government and the defense submit that the legislative history supports their respective positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.253" offset="2289951">There is a slight difference, however.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.001" offset="2300922">If the Court would take a look at the references that the government has made to support their concept of legislative history, they are statements, speeches, and parts of the record, Congressional Record, that reflect the opinions of individual senators and members of the House.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.195" offset="2381693">It is not the position of the entire Congress that passed the statute and that is the intent we are going for if we are going to look at legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="568.613" offset="2419413">We, on the other hand, rely upon primarily the Preamble to Senate Bill 30, which was 1963, became 1963, which expressly limits the forfeiture of interest in an enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.670" offset="2479600">Also, the Senate reports and House reports which were the synopses and the explanations that were given to the senators and the congressmen when they, in fact, were required to vote on the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.930" offset="2532680">When they said, what is this all about, that is what they were looking at.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="601.022" stopTime="615.814">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="601.022" offset="2548981">Mr. Dion, you say that the government relies on speeches by individual senators and House members and you rely on synopses and a preamble.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.284" offset="2598091">Neither of you rely on the words of the statute itself?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_a_dion" startTime="615.814" stopTime="630.886">
            <label>Mr. Ronald A. Dion</label>
            <text syncTime="615.814" offset="2608226">Well, both of us rely initially on the wording of the statute and both submit that the express wording supports their respective positions.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.342" offset="2638320">Needless to say, unfortunately, it can't, so obviously there is a conflict and the question of what the expression is.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="630.886" stopTime="632.353">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="630.886" offset="2668517">At that point you go to the secondary theory.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_a_dion" startTime="632.353" stopTime="642.724">
            <label>Mr. Ronald A. Dion</label>
            <text syncTime="632.353" offset="2674368">That is when both sides go to the secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.118" offset="2681369">Obviously, the express wording is of primary concern and the legislative history is really a secondary source of interpretation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="642.724" stopTime="670.510">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="642.724" offset="2715851">Mr. Dion, with respect to Congress' stated purpose which, as I understand it, was to eradicate organized crime, why in the world would Congress have wanted to exempt from forfeiture cash profits that are the primary product of an illegal enterprise?</text>
            <text syncTime="665.622" offset="2807384">I think your argument is a little strange in that regard.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_a_dion" startTime="670.510" stopTime="716.788">
            <label>Mr. Ronald A. Dion</label>
            <text syncTime="670.510" offset="2826924">Well, there are primarily two reasons, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.039" offset="2845105">The first question is a policy determination that really needs to be addressed by Congress and I believe has been addressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="683.567" offset="2879168">And, that is a question of we have now punished the racketeer by throwing him in jail.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.143" offset="2905500">We have punished the racketeer by separating him from his office in the enterprise and separating him from his interest in the enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="701.388" offset="2950535">We have now fined the individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.903" offset="2960566">Now, we get to the question of the forfeiture aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.714" offset="2975822">Who is it that we wish to protect?</text>
            <text syncTime="712.226" offset="2993794">Who should be the benefactor of the forfeiture?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="716.788" stopTime="721.973">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="716.788" offset="3012080">Wasn't it Congress' whole purpose to make a crime unprofitable?</text>

            <label>Mr. Ronald A. Dion</label>
            <text syncTime="721.973" offset="3032873">Of course, it was.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="723.051" stopTime="725.909">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="723.051" offset="3037157">And, if you don't forfeit the profits, how do you do that?</text>

          <turn speaker="ronald_a_dion" startTime="725.909" stopTime="789.477">
            <label>Mr. Ronald A. Dion</label>
            <text syncTime="725.909" offset="3048546">Well, again, there are two answers.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.456" offset="3058786">The first one is that it still is forfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.235" offset="3069862">Not only is it forfeitable under civil law, it is subject to treble damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.717" offset="3091805">I believe it was a question of policy of if we are going to take the criminal out of the enterprise, who should get the benefit of the forfeiture?</text>
            <text syncTime="744.995" offset="3124928">Should it be the government or the victim?</text>
            <text syncTime="747.354" offset="3134333">That is one answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.932" offset="3140706">The other one is a little bit more technical and, unfortunately, it is supposition since no one can really tell.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.006" offset="3172994">I would respectfully submit that one of the problems that Congress had was that when they passed the first United States in personam forfeiture action, they were most concerned with the constitutionality of the act.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.578" offset="3235270">And, I believe that when they sent... particularly Senator McClellan requested Attorney General Kleindienst to answer the question of the constitutionality.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.933" offset="3276648">Now we are getting into the Kleindeinst letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="785.541" offset="3287097">I believe this is one of the true reasons and importances of the Kleindienst letter.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="789.477" stopTime="797.021">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="789.477" offset="3302875">Well, that letter referred to a different version of the bill that was eventually enacted.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="ronald_a_dion" startTime="797.021" stopTime="889.108">
            <label>Mr. Ronald A. Dion</label>
            <text syncTime="797.021" offset="3332968">It was a predecessor of the 1963, however, the importance of the statute... of the letter at this juncture is that when Congress said, is it constitutional, Kleindeinst responded, yes, it is constitutional as limited, as limited to interest in the enterprise, and as limited so that no other property is subject to forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="824.478" offset="3442891">I think it really came down to a very simply question.</text>
            <text syncTime="827.352" offset="3454385">Congress was afraid that if they extended the forfeiture beyond the limitations which were imposed by that letter that they would be getting into an area of constitutional dimension.</text>
            <text syncTime="839.503" offset="3502973">And, in order to avoid it, they went into the civil remedies and the civil treble damage forfeitures that were provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.938" offset="3536723">There is another aspect of the Kleindeinst letter that I believe is important.</text>
            <text syncTime="852.546" offset="3555113">The importance of the Kleindeinst letter is not the opinion of the Attorney General that it is limited, forfeitures are limited to an interest in an enterprise, because as Your Honor correctly pointed out, that applied to a prior forfeiture proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.494" offset="3614881">The importance of it is that it was included in Senate Bill 30 in the Preamble to show the intent of the Senate in passing the Bill, the intent of the limitation being there.</text>
            <text syncTime="881.018" offset="3669007">So, it is Congress' intent by using the letter in their Preamble and referring to it that is important, not the Attorney General's personal opinion.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="889.108" offset="3701399">Mr. Dion, looking again at the language of 1963(a) as it appears in your brief at, I guess, the second page of the Appendix, what is the difference in operation between Subsection...

            <text syncTime="1511.204" offset="6189719">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.165" offset="6237575">As Justice O'Connor observed, Congress' stated objective in enacting the RICO statute was nothing less than "eradication of organized crime" by, among other things, providing enhanced sanctions and new remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.598" offset="6303299">It is worth noting that in the preface to the RICO statute Congress, the entire Congress stated that its objective was to do this and found</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.796" offset="6348125">"that organized crime in the United States is a highly sophisticated, diversified, and widespread activity that annually drains billions of dollars of America's economy by unlawful conduct and the illegal use of force, fraud, and corruption. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1566.633" offset="6411446">Organized crime derives a major portion of its power through money obtained through such illegal endeavors as syndicated gambling, loansharking, the theft and fencing of property, the importation and distribution of narcotics and other dangerous drugs, and other forms of social exploitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.000" offset="6488977">Given Congress' objective and its finding, it would have been surprising is Congress had enacted a racketeering forfeiture statute, but had held back from authorizing the forfeiture of the illegal profits that constitute organized crime's life blood and the source of its wealth and power.</text>
            <text syncTime="1607.023" offset="6572987">Neither petitioner nor the dissent in the court below nor any court or commentator has been able to identify any convincing reason why Congress might not have wanted to authorize the forfeiture of racketeering profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="1621.704" offset="6631711">Certainly there is nothing harsh or unfair about doing so, about requiring a convicted criminal to give up his illegal gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.232" offset="6669849">In this case, for example, petitioner obtained some $340,000 in insurance proceeds by taking out fire insurance on his property and arranging for an arsonist to burn it down.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.883" offset="6720422">There is no reason why he should be permitted to keep that money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.287" offset="6734111">What reasons as petitioner suggested this morning--</text>

            <text syncTime="1652.364" offset="6754382">What exactly is it that you contend should be forfeited to the United States as opposed to what the insurance company might get back?</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.579" offset="6783221">I take it that the insurance company might have a claim to this money too.</text>

            <text syncTime="1662.797" offset="6796073">--That is right, Justice, Stevens, but there is no contradiction there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1667.609" offset="6815404">Under 1963(c) the Attorney General is directed to dispose of forfeited property, making due provision for the rights of innocent persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.229" offset="6849885">And, under the procedures that are incorporated into RICO, a victim of racketeering can apply to the Attorney General to receive the forfeited property and can receive that property.</text>
            <text syncTime="1687.225" offset="6893875">So there is no contradiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1690.692" offset="6907668">The government would, in effect, collect the forfeited property and turn it back to the insurance company.</text>

            <text syncTime="1799.241" offset="7341928">Well, one critical difference between the two provisions is that under (a)(1), as we read that statute, the interest must be illegally obtained.</text>
            <text syncTime="1808.285" offset="7378081">It is an interest acquired or maintained in violation of Section 1962.</text>

            <text syncTime="1820.421" offset="7426564">It may be a lawfully acquired interest in an enterprise that the defendant has established, conducted, controlled, or participated in in violation of the RICO statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.166" offset="7473585">1963(a)(1) is really the less controversial provision of the forfeiture statute, because it talks about illegally obtained interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1842.005" offset="7512977">1963(a)(2) goes further and takes interest that may be lawfully obtained but have been associated with an enterprise that has been found to be unlawful.</text>

            <text syncTime="2102.572" offset="8555263">One may have an interest in a lawful enterprise and they use that enterprise to facilitate racketeering activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.444" offset="8582744">And, it may be that the racketeering activity does not further the enterprise, but the enterprise furthers the racketeering activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.566" offset="8619211">That results in a forfeiture under (a)(2) and would not fall within the meaning of the word (a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.420" offset="8650662">Petitioner suggested this morning that one of the reasons that Congress held back from authorizing the forfeiture of racketeering profits was because they entertained some constitutional doubts about their ability to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.898" offset="8724537">He quickly concedes that he doesn't see any constitutional problem and it is noteworthy that this provision of a continuing criminal enterprise statute, upon which he relied and which was enacted during the same term of Congress, authorized the forfeiture of illegal income derived from a continuing criminal enterprise engaged in drug activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.889" offset="8812517">In passing that statute, Congress had no constitutional doubts, so it is farfetched, I would suggest, to argue that Congress had unexpressed constitutional doubts of very dubious validity about authorizing the forfeiture of the RICO statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2186.116" offset="8889422">He argued that Congress may have held back in authorizing the forfeiture of racketeering profits because they thought that the civil remedies were enough, but this is unconvincing for a number of reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2199.143" offset="8941457">First, in many case, narcotics, gambling, prostitution, there may be no identifiable victims to come forward and bring civil suit and the result is that the racketeer gets to keep his illegal gain even though he has been convicted of participating in a criminal offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.994" offset="9012928">The only argument he raised in his brief and the only argument that was raised by the dissent below for why Congress might not have wanted to authorize the forfeiture of racketeering profits is that our society, he says, is traditionally abhored in personam forfeitures.</text>
            <text syncTime="2233.535" offset="9079071">But, this argument is not good for at least two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2237.549" offset="9095162">First of all, as I said, whatever attitudes were in the past, there is little doubt that the Congress that passed the RICO statute did not abhor in personam forfeiture because it enacted an in personam statute, both in RICO and in the continuing criminal enterprise statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.775" offset="9172066">The RICO provision that is not challenged here, 1963(a)(2), authorizes the forfeiture of interests that may have been lawfully obtained and, therefore, that is a far more extreme position than the forfeiture of illegally obtained gains.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.862" offset="9248344">It is not disputed that Congress wanted to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2278.937" offset="9260674">The second reason why this argument is not convincing is that it simply is not true in personam have been historically disfavored.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.073" offset="9297245">What was outlawed by the Constitution and by the first Congress was a particular harsh type of in personam forfeiture, what was known in common law as forfeiture by attainder under which the convicted felon was pronounced legally dead and he lost all of his property and he lost the right to transmit property to his heirs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.378" offset="9382404">Now, just because that was felt to be too harsh, it certainly doesn't follow that the same is true of all in personam forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="2317.016" offset="9413020">On the contrary, in personam forfeiture is really less harsh than in rem forfeiture because it is a criminal proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.498" offset="9442904">The government must satisfy the reasonable doubt standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="2423.129" offset="9837457">I think it is at least as harsh, in many ways much harsher, than the in personam forfeiture that is involved here and simply results in a personal judgment against the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.766" offset="9879985">My point is that is not to venture into the area of policy whether it is socially desirable to forfeit racketeering profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.481" offset="9918855">My point is that no one has been able to suggest why Congress might not have wanted to do this and with that in mind I would like to turn to the language in the legislative history of RICO, both of which demonstrate that Congress did quite clearly intend to authorize forfeiture of interest such as those involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.644" offset="9995551">Now, of course, the starting point, as petitioner observed, is the language of 1963(a)(1) itself which calls for the forfeiture of any interest in an enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.905" offset="10040586">Excuse me, of any interest acquired or maintained in violation of 1962, not an interest in enterprise, any interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2483.136" offset="10077471">And, profits obtained from racketeering fall squarely within the plain meaning of this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.570" offset="10099204">Petitioner contests this on the grounds that an interest means an interest in something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.318" offset="10122192">But, that usage is only employed to draw distinction between the interest which is a bundle of rights, and the thing to which the interest applies, so that racketeering profits are clearly an interest in something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.547" offset="10183110">They are in interest in cash, in a bank account, in CD's or the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="2515.357" offset="10206411">If the language of 1963(a)(1) is not clear enough, then the contrast with 1963(a)(2) is really dispositive.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.275" offset="10249983">1963(a)(1) talks about any interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.538" offset="10267120">1963(a)(2) talks about an interest in an enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.723" offset="10287808">When Congress places a limitation like that in one subsection and omits it from another, the inference is virtually inescapable that they did so for a purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="2546.704" offset="10331799">And, I don't think it is a convincing explanation to suggest, as petitioner did here, that Congress simply wanted to say "inc".</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.591" offset="10359280">and did not want to have to include the modifying terms, in an enterprise, in 1963(a)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.152" offset="10389582">Our interpretation is also supported by the RICO statute's definition of the term "enterprise", which is not limited to legal entities, but also extends to wholly illegitimate ones as this Court held in Turkette.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.300" offset="10454156">Since Congress wanted to attack these enterprises, it would not make sense for it to limit its forfeiture provision in such as way as to make it ineffectual in doing so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2590.733" offset="10507864">Yet, in a case of an illegitimate enterprise, there were usually no interest in the enterprise that can be forfeited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.622" offset="10535449">They usually don't issue stock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2599.824" offset="10544226">So, it would not have made sense for Congress to provide solely for the forfeiture of interest in an enterprise and not income which is the source of organized crime's power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2611.146" offset="10589471">Petitioner relies on the use of the term 1962(a), one of the prohibitory provisions, and states that if Congress intended to require the forfeiture of income in 1963(a)(1), it would have used the term "income" there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.622" offset="10667420">Well, I hardly think there is a dispute about whether the term "income" was in Congress' vocabulary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2636.621" offset="10691453">It knew the term, but it had a good reason for using a different term in 1963(a)(1), because while that provisions reaches income, it is not limited to income.</text>
            <text syncTime="2650.288" offset="10746101">It includes many other types of real and personal property and other things that afford sources of wealth and control.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.455" offset="10774731">The alternative to using the broad less specific term 1963(a)(1) would have been an enumeration of all the things subject to forfeiture.</text>

            <text syncTime="2721.087" offset="11029268">In a somewhat related argument, petitioner relies on the contemporaneously enacted provision of continuing criminal enterprise statue which, as I said, authorizes the forfeiture of illegal income derived from the kinds of enterprises with which that statute is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.312" offset="11118189">But, although it is true that these two provisions were contemporaneously enacted, they are really the handiwork of different congressional committees, and, thus, it is not clear their language was placed under a microscope and compared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2757.946" offset="11176703">Moreover, the language is fully consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2761.805" offset="11192168">In the C.C.E. statute, Congress was concerned with a single, narrow type of enterprise, an enterprise that is engaged in drug activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.957" offset="11228739">These enterprises usually generate large cash profits and there usually is not an interest in the enterprise that can be forfeited.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.625" offset="11263430">So, Congress used the narrow term "income".</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.202" offset="11277745">In RICO, Congress was concerned with a different problem with a vast variety of enterprises and with more than 30 specific kinds of enumerated criminal conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2794.541" offset="11323093">So, it used the broader term "interest".</text>

            <text syncTime="2948.915" offset="11940628">There are three points I would make about the legislative history very quickly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.851" offset="11956302">First, there are numerous places in the legislative history where sponsors and principal advocates of RICO, not just any congressman, but the congressmen who were responsible for drafting this bill and getting it enacted, stated that one of the purposes of the forfeiture provision was to take away racketeers' illegal gain.</text>
            <text syncTime="2972.843" offset="12036341">In the Senate, Senator McClellan, who was probably the chief sponsor of the bill, stated that RICO</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.341" offset="12058284">"would forfeit the ill-gotten gain of criminals where the enter or operate an organization through a pattern of racketeering activity. "</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2986.447" offset="12090675">Well, Mr. Alito, do you think you could take a senator's statement on the floor that we want ill-gotten gains forfeited and say he must have meant profits as opposed to other kinds of interests?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="3001.848" stopTime="3018.590">
            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3001.848" offset="12152324">I think that is what ill-gotten gains means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3003.972" offset="12160788">It means illegal profit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.236" offset="12165908">It certainly doesn't mean... That certainly is a much more reasonable reading than to say that it means a lawfully acquired interest in an enterprise that has been used to further a criminal purpose.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3018.590" offset="12219302">But, my query was whether Senator McClellan was really focusing on the fine distinctions that perhaps the statute might have drawn when he said ill-gotten gain.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="samuel_alito_jr" startTime="3030.367" stopTime="3227.208">
            <label>Mr. Samuel A. Alito Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="3030.367" offset="12266427">Well, it is less specific than we might have hoped, but I think it is a reasonable approximation of our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3038.520" offset="12299028">And, this is not a single, isolated statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.909" offset="12308537">There are many statements in the debate to that effect and they illicited no opposition or inquiries from other members of Congress suggesting that maybe they shouldn't go that far.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.281" offset="12350019">Representative Poth, to give just one more example, who was perhaps the statute's chief advocate in the House, said after conviction the ill-gotten gains must be forfeited to the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3062.510" offset="12394950">And, the House Report stated that the forfeiture provision extends</text>
            <text syncTime="3067.461" offset="12414803">"to all property and interests as broadly defined which are related to the violation. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.662" offset="12435596">And, as I said, there are other statements to this effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.240" offset="12445941">The second point is, as I have pointed out, that forfeiting racketeering profits is entirely consistent with Congress' broad intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.190" offset="12481676">And, there are many specific problems that Congress was concerned with during the congressional debates that virtually cry out for the forfeiture of racketeering profits.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.169" offset="12525562">One example are illegal businesses that organized crime has dominated like narcotics and gambling where there are no interests in the enterprise that can be taken in forfeiture, but striking at the illegal profits really gets at the heart of the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3112.068" offset="12593167">And, another was the practice of taking over a legitimate business, skimming off profits and leaving it bankrupt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.847" offset="12624305">Forfeiting and interest in the bankrupt shell would not do any good, but taking the illegal profits that are drained off the business would be an effective remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3128.703" offset="12659727">The third point that emerges from the legislative history is it is certainly true, as petitioner points out, that there are statements in the legislative history that the forfeiture provision results in the forfeiture of interests in an enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.789" offset="12720122">But, none of the statements, addressed to the finally enacted version of RICO, states that the forfeiture provision is limited to these interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.941" offset="12760664">These are merely illustrative and not exhaustive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.331" offset="12774248">And, as to the letter from Deputy Attorney General Kleindeinst upon which petitioner relies, this addressed an earlier version of the RICO statute that was limited to interest in an enterprise, so it really sheds no light on what the finally enacted and amended version means.</text>
            <text syncTime="3177.307" offset="12854182">This letter was quoted and cited in the Senate Report because of its bearing on the question of the constitutionality of the forfeiture of interest in an enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.194" offset="12893680">And, the point that Mr. Kleindeinst was making was there isn't a constitutional problem when the forfeited interest is one in an enterprise that was involved in the violation and not simply an enterprise that the convicted person happened to have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3202.282" offset="12954075">In conclusion, the forfeiture of racketeering profits is an extremely important weapon in the on-going battle against organized crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="3211.856" offset="12992318">The plain language of RICO and the legislative history show with some certainty that Congress intended to acquire the forfeiture of such proceeds and we, therefore, urge that the judgment of the court below be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="3233.003" offset="13076955">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.860" offset="13100360">I would like to respond to two things in particular that possibly were not discussed in the affirmative argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.654" offset="13123557">One question is what exactly is the difference and the purpose of in personam jurisdiction versus in rem forfeiture jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.589" offset="13159293">The reason that they went over to in personam jurisdiction is twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="3260.289" offset="13186042">Number one, unlike in rem jurisdiction, it allows for the immediate and mandatory forfeiture, totally non-discretionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="3272.347" offset="13234316">In rem, you have independent lawsuits, independent parties involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3278.345" offset="13258349">More importantly, the reason that it was in personam is so that the 1963 forfeiture could serve its purpose and go to things that were normally not forfeitable, that are not in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3292.901" offset="13316550">I think the case of United States versus Rubin is the perfect example of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.150" offset="13333582">The government wanted the racketeer out the union, out of the enterprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3303.787" offset="13360122">To do this, the 5th Circuit said, all right, it is subject... the office is subject to forfeiture.</text>
            <text syncTime="3309.472" offset="13382796">That is not in rem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3311.488" offset="13390842">It has to be in personam.</text>
            <text syncTime="3313.267" offset="13398052">That is the reason for the in personam jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.189" offset="13409650">It is all well and good for the government to say that we think profits should be forfeitable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3325.045" offset="13445072">We believe that it is an effective weapon.</text>
            <text syncTime="3328.074" offset="13457193">That is not what we are here to discuss.</text>
            <text syncTime="3331.010" offset="13469000">What we are here to discuss is whether it does or does not fall under the statute as written.</text>
            <text syncTime="3335.369" offset="13486450">For example, the government has gone down and listed a number of things that they believe are subject to forfeiture under RICO which only has as its fruits, if you will--</text>

            <text syncTime="3432.704" offset="13875779">One of the things that is interesting is the government talks about the history of the last 15 years, how now, because forfeitures are so run-of-the-mill, we can interpret them as broadly as we possibly want.</text>
            <text syncTime="3443.621" offset="13919456">However, none of those were on the books in 1970 when the issue of the intent of Congress actually came into being, the kind of after-the-fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.868" offset="13952370">I think one of the important things though is what really was the purpose of the racketeering statute?</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.006" offset="13976925">The purpose of the statute... and I don't think there is really any argument on this... is to get the racketeer out of the enterprise, to allow the enterprise to live independent of the racketeering and to survive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3473.421" offset="14038574">Very simply stated, unless the profits and proceeds are put back into an enterprise, it falls outside the scope of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.916" offset="14092595">That is one of the reasons we have 1962(a).</text>
            <text syncTime="3491.165" offset="14109627">That is what provides for the substantive crime and ultimately the forfeiture when there is a plowing back into an enterprise of illegally obtained interest and proceeds.</text>
            <text syncTime="3503.987" offset="14160932">If the interest and proceeds are not put back into the enterprise... though it may very well be that Congress would love to get those profits and proceeds... it goes outside the purpose and scope of the racketeering statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="3528.821" offset="14260197">However, at the same time, we take a look at what are the underlying crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3534.647" offset="14283498">The government basically says we have got to go after profits and proceeds as a forfeiture of all the underlying crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3541.004" offset="14308994">If we look at the list of underlying crimes, Congress has not provided for forfeiture of the underlying substantive crimes in many cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.265" offset="14338042">Gambling, prostitution and murder, for example, have no forfeiture provisions attached to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3553.686" offset="14359671">That is one of the reasons I would suggest that the scope and purpose of RICO is getting the criminal out of the enterprise and that under that interpretation the statute can be read as expressly worded without a provision for the forfeiture of income, profits, and proceeds.</text>
