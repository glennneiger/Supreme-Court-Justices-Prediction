            <text syncTime="7.570" offset="164786">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="11.974" offset="182444">This case raises the question of what elements the government must prove in order to establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. 1001, the federal false statements statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="25.281" offset="235630">Respondent in this case filled out a form in connection with a security clearance process required by the Department of Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.637" offset="269066">Respondent had been hired as an engineer by a company that was a defense contractor.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.375" offset="292054">In order to work on certain projects, it was necessary that he be investigated and that he receive a government security clearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="47.564" offset="324759">For that purpose, Respondent's employer gave him a work sheet to fill out.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.866" offset="345971">On that work sheet, Respondent indicated that he had never been convicted of a crime and he listed the employers for whom he had worked in the past.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.990" offset="382542">Respondent's employer transcribed that information onto another form entitled</text>
            <text syncTime="68.310" offset="407724">"Department of Defense personnel security questionnaire. "</text>
            <text syncTime="71.779" offset="421621">Respondent signed that form and it was mailed to the Department of Defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.000" offset="442519">Subsequently, the FBI discovered that in fact Respondent had been convicted of mail fraud and that two of the employers that he had listed on his form in fact had never employed Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.158" offset="499153">On the basis of those false statements, Respondent was indicted and convicted for violations of Section 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.764" offset="533635">At trial Respondent's sole defense was that he had not realized that the false information he provided would be forwarded to the federal government.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.221" offset="575430">Both sides in this case agree that the government must establish certain elements in order to make out a violation of Section 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.993" offset="614510">The government must prove that the defendant's statements were false and that he knew it at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.433" offset="644289">Respondent acknowledges here that his statements were false and that he knew that when he filled out and signed the form.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.889" offset="678144">Both sides also agree that the government must establish that a defendant made his statement in a matter within federal agency jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.894" offset="714088">Respondent agrees with us that his false statements were made in such a matter, since the government security clearance process is a matter within the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense.</text>

            <text syncTime="246.593" offset="1120867">So that the employee could be liable under the statute without having any knowledge of federal involvement?</text>

            <label>Ms. Carolyn Corwin</label>
            <text syncTime="251.295" offset="1139675">Yes, that is our position, that Congress did not intend that the government prove knowledge of federal involvement in a case like this.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.901" offset="1170186">That is precisely the point on which the parties disagree in this case, whether the government must prove that the defendant knew that there was federal involvement when he makes a false statement.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.875" offset="1218043">Three Court of Appeals, the Fifth, the Sixth, and the Seventh Circuits, have held that such proof is not an element of a Section 1001 offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.731" offset="1253465">The Ninth Circuit here held that the government is required to prove knowledge of federal involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.735" offset="1281468">Now, this question is similar to one that many federal courts have confronted in the context of a number of different federal statutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.741" offset="1313546">This Court considered just a question in United States versus Feola.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.293" offset="1335698">That case involved a federal statute and the question raised was whether it was necessary for the government to prove that an assailant knew that his victim was a federal officer in order to make out a violation of the federal assault statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="316.087" offset="1398915">The Court analyzed Congress' purposes in enacting the statute and it considered whether the element of knowledge was necessary as a matter of fairness, in order to prevent unfairness, and on the basis of that analysis it concluded that Congress in enacting the federal assault statute had intended... had not intended to require the government to prove knowledge of federal involvement on top of all the other elements it was required to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.507" offset="1520541">We suggest that in this case the Feola analysis and conclusions apply a fortiori in the case of Section 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="358.064" offset="1566830">We begin with the language, and here I think we have a stronger case than the Court was confronted with in Feola.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.920" offset="1598177">There the federal assault statute on its face simply didn't say anything about the required intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.007" offset="1626598">Here we have a statute that talks about knowingly and willfully making a false statement, so we have words of intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.513" offset="1664632">But I think it's quite clear from the face of the statute that those words apply to the making of a false statement and not to the separate phrase,</text>
            <text syncTime="392.587" offset="1704861">"in any matter within federal agency jurisdiction. "</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="395.772" offset="1717608">Ms. Corwin, does the government agree that the shifting of the language in the 1948 revision was not intended to achieve any substantive result?</text>

            <label>Ms. Carolyn Corwin</label>
            <text syncTime="407.247" offset="1763479">Yes, and indeed this Court has suggested it wasn't intended.</text>
            <text syncTime="411.382" offset="1780093">In Bramblett the Court signified that it had not intended a substantive change.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="415.936" offset="1798275">Before '48 the language wasn't quite as favorable to this particular part of your argument as it is now.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carolyn_corwin" startTime="423.690" stopTime="605.376">
            <label>Ms. Carolyn Corwin</label>
            <text syncTime="423.690" offset="1829308">Well, I'm not sure that that is quite so, although I would not preliminarily that we ought to give some credit to the fact that in 1948 Congress thought it was clarifying an ambiguity; and to the extent that it was attempting to do that I think we ought to read today's statute rather than the older one.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.003" offset="1906526">But even if the language had never been shifted, I don't think that changes the fact that that "in any matter" phrase has always been somewhat set apart from the rest of the statute and has been phrased in terms that don't sound at all in any sort of intent or purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.632" offset="1981027">I think that's significant on the face of the statute, whether you look at the old statute or the recodified version, and I think it's even more significant when you look at the language that had existed prior to the amendment in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.593" offset="2048946">There you had a phrase that, in addition to the knowingly and willfully language, said:</text>
            <text syncTime="485.164" offset="2075172">"Whoever, with the purpose or the intent of cheating or swindling or defrauding the United States, knowingly and willfully makes a false statement. "</text>
            <text syncTime="494.453" offset="2112371">In 1934 Congress replaced that language with this</text>
            <text syncTime="499.940" offset="2134314">"in any matter within federal agency jurisdiction. "</text>
            <text syncTime="502.542" offset="2144658">phrase, a phrase that doesn't sound at all in any sort of intent or purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.946" offset="2166288">Now, the Court in Feola looked primarily to the legislative purpose and the legislative history to determine whether Congress would have intended that knowledge of federal involvement be an element of the crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.722" offset="2225429">Under Section 1001, these factors appear to point at least as clearly as in Feola to the conclusion that knowledge of federal involvement is not something that Congress would have required the government to prove.</text>
            <text syncTime="537.648" offset="2285092">This Court has construed Section 1001 on several occasions... in the Gilliland case, in the Bramblett case, and in the Bryson case... and on each occasion the Court has noted the breadth of the statute and the Congressional purpose to afford protection to all sorts of federal functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="559.228" offset="2371401">The Court has concluded that it's inappropriate to read the statute restrictively in light of that very broad Congressional purpose in amending the statute in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.303" offset="2415705">Now, the interest in protecting federal functions is one that exists regardless of the individual's knowledge of whether he is involved in a government matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.011" offset="2470562">In this case, Respondent's false statement concerning his prior conviction and his prior employers had just as much potential to interfere with federal functions, whether or not he knew about whether there was this government security clearance process going on.</text>

            <text syncTime="647.369" offset="2724054">But I think it's important to recall that the government has to prove a number of things in order to make out a violation of Section 1001 quite apart from the issue we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="658.309" offset="2767731">One of those things it has to prove is that a statement was made willfully.</text>

            <text syncTime="892.729" offset="3705422">And I suppose it depends on the context, when you suggest the lying about age; and I remind you again that there are things the government has to prove in terms of, for example, materiality, and it may be that a statement like that wouldn't be material.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.323" offset="3771878">But I think that a false statement, particularly in the sort of context you have here, in the employment context, is not only going to be something someone knows is wrongful, but is either going to come quite close or arguably falls within the state false pretenses statute, in which you may intend to deceive your employer, and that is something that falls within the state criminal statute.</text>

            <text syncTime="961.921" offset="3982216">And I think it's unlikely that Congress would have intended to impose, in addition to all the other elements that the government has to prove, that additional burden of proving that an individual actually knew that he was acting in a matter within federal agency jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="1016.775" offset="4201644">Well, I think that's right, and it is certainly conceivable that on a remand that we would prevail in this case on the basis of that sort of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.400" offset="4244172">I don't know that that's necessarily going to be the case every time this comes up, and I think it may well be that... I mean, Respondent here believes, at least has some idea, that he can prevail on this sort of standard, and I think it is not certain that the government is going to prevail in every case like Respondent's with the sort of simply evidence of knowledge that's circumstantial that you suggest.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.383" offset="4356080">Now, I think in terms of the legislative history in 1934, Respondent has tried to suggest that Congress was trying to accomplish something very narrow.</text>
            <text syncTime="1066.275" offset="4399652">I think that that simply is not so when you look at the face of the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.845" offset="4425879">As I referred to when I spoke to Justice Rehnquist's question, the substitution of the phrase... the old phrase,</text>

            <text syncTime="1087.188" offset="4483244">"in any matter within federal agency jurisdiction. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.823" offset="4493798">I think that's the key point that happened in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="1093.925" offset="4510203">But when you look at some of the other material in the legislative history, I don't think it supports Respondent's construction of the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.214" offset="4543430">There was no mention of attempting to correct the U.S. versus Cohn case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.185" offset="4563284">That's surely something that Congress had in mind, but I think they were aiming at a somewhat broader problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="1113.589" offset="4588884">They had some difficulties that had arisen in some of these federal programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1118.457" offset="4608319">They were confronted with false statements that were causing things like the hot oil program and the public works program to break down, and they were attempting to find a comprehensive solution that would apply to a number of federal agencies and a range of federal functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.002" offset="4678536">Now, the Court in Feola also turned to the question of whether it was unfair to convict an individual without that element of knowledge of federal involvement, and that's a relevant question, I suppose, because it tells us something about what Congress must have had in mind when it acted at the time here in 1934, and indeed, I read Respondent to be centering his argument on this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1164.371" offset="4792012">But I think as I noted in answering Justice O'Connor's question, I think it is frequently that one is going to have conduct that meets all the elements of Section 1001, even without knowledge, that conduct is going to be wrongful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.435" offset="4872260">Now, Respondent here acknowledges that his conduct was wrongful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.820" offset="4889814">He says no question about that, he intended to deceive his employer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.041" offset="4906741">He just didn't know that he was also deceiving the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.242" offset="4919489">And he poses some hypotheticals that involve, as I've suggested to Justice Stevens, a casual private conversation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.031" offset="4958673">Those would not be covered under Section 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.550" offset="4972779">The government would not have been able to prove that they were in a matter within federal agency jurisdiction, in all probability, and would not have been able to prove they were willful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.173" offset="5007261">I suggest that frequently conduct that falls within Section 1001 is going to be either within or close to the line of a state criminal statute and is clearly going to be the sort of conscious wrongdoing that we really don't hesitate to impose criminal penalties on.</text>

            <text syncTime="1736.324" offset="7079816">And they're seeking reversal.</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.176" offset="7087235">The history of the statute is convoluted, but there is a clear thread woven into the statute from it's original antecedent through the 1948 recodification, and that thread is the requirement that a person know of federal involvement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1753.519" offset="7148570">Since the 1948 amendment itself was non-substantive, as the Court has recognized, it is necessary to focus on the 1934 legislative process and intent of Congress in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="1768.196" offset="7207293">Significantly, the first bill that was submitted to Congress in 1934 contained language of specific intent to defraud the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1777.467" offset="7244387">That first bill, of course, was vetoed, but it was vetoed because it failed to reach further than the existing 1918 statute and to reach the concerns expressed by the Court in United States versus Cohn.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.394" offset="7300080">Contrary to the government's position, the first bill was not vetoed because it contained language of specific intent to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="1802.183" offset="7343235">In the second bill, the one that was finally enacted, the "in any matter" language first appears.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.273" offset="7371656">The government well understands that the vetoed bill required the specific intent to defraud, but nevertheless the government argues that the new language, the 1863.</text>
            <text syncTime="1832.352" offset="7463920">It is our position that there is nothing in the veto language, nor in the remarks of Congress, nor in the experience of Congress as of 1934 that would have led Congress to abandon the long-standing knowledge requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.648" offset="7525151">On the contrary, it appears from the sparse legislative history that Congress finally recognized the problem created in the Cohn type situation and the problem inherent in the 1918 statute and that Congress therefore inserted the new phrase to encompass non-monetary deceptions of newly created federal programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1873.679" offset="7629223">It's interesting to note, I think, that in 1948 what had been Section 35 of the Criminal Code was brought within the penumbra of the 1000 section of Title 18, and it was in 1948 that Section 35 became Section 1001.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.461" offset="7716368">And in doing so, Congress incorporated our statute into the broader statutory scheme which was contained in 1001 through 1016.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.102" offset="7766941">I think it's noteworthy that in this broad scheme all of the other false statement statutes either on their face require a specific intent to defraud, such as 1005, which prohibits false entries in bank books with the intent to defraud... that is the specific language... or in 1004 or 1011, the status, the very status or position of the covered personnel, such as a bank officer or a mortgagee, gives adequate notice to the person that he is dealing with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.644" offset="7917092">If the government's interpretation of 1001 is accepted, it would appear that there would be no need for these specific statutes, because the government could always resort to Section 1001 and thereby circumvent the specific statutes which either require specific intent on their face or give notice to the defendant by his very status that he is dealing with the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.628" offset="8025030">The government goes on to argue that the social and political context of the new deal, the background as they call it, indicate that Congress must have intended to delete the long-standing requirement of jurisdictional knowledge from the 1934 statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.839" offset="8097860">First of all, there is no record of such concerns in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1996.910" offset="8122206">There is no mention whatsoever of this concern in President Roosevelt's veto language.</text>
            <text syncTime="2002.664" offset="8145194">And I would contend that if those had been the concerns of Congress they would have been... they would have shown up in the first bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2013.170" offset="8187199">That is, if these had been the concerns of Congress, the first bill would not have contained the specific language that it did, the language of intent to defraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.827" offset="8233801">Although Congress concededly was concerned about the integrity of all federal programs and the newly created federal programs, Congress in our view had no reason to address a person such as that of Respondent who had no knowledge of federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.391" offset="8312064">I think what shows that is that the vast majority of the intermediary cases, statements made to an intermediary where there is knowledge of the federal destination of the statement, the vast majority of those cases cited in both briefs arose in the 1960's and '70's, as the government delegated more responsibility to the states and to private industry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.241" offset="8423450">There simply is no indication that Congress was even aware of such a problem in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="2078.814" offset="8449781">Turning to the Feola case, we contend that Section 1001 is fundamentally different from Section 1011, the federal assault statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.587" offset="8492936">If the government is correct, then 1001 could be used to punish persons who make private statements, statement which, unlike assault, no state law may proscribe, which are not fraudulent... and which are not fraudulent by any stretch of the imagination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2107.381" offset="8564093">The government does not acknowledge that there are situations where the making of a private false statement and federal agency jurisdiction are contemporaneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.939" offset="8606307">Could I... could you tell me where you made the... you requested the instruction that you think should have been given in this case?</text>

            <text syncTime="2287.898" offset="9286118">I believe that the experience of the lower courts tells us that when a defense of no knowledge is raised, that the facts will usually overwhelmingly rebut a defendant's claim of no knowledge if it is a sham.</text>

            <text syncTime="2398.502" offset="9728528">But I believe that, with the drug importation analogy, the government is not heard to complain that they are put to proof by proving knowledge that the person was importing a controlled substance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.661" offset="9785161">The government does justifiably raise some concerns that our interpretation could lead to a serious situation, such as perhaps a knowingly defective part being placed in a nuclear reactor without someone knowing that it was going to be within a matter of federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.742" offset="9869484">That is an appropriate concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.944" offset="9882337">I believe, however, that such an action is inherently dangerous and gives notice to the wrongdoer of the danger, and I think that the action could be proscribed under the reasoning of this Court in United States versus Freed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.786" offset="9945657">For situations which are not inherently dangerous, Congress could if it chose draft a statute which prohibited the submissions of false statements which affect a federal agency, and could if it chose eliminate a jurisdictional knowledge requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.967" offset="10026428">For the very small class of persons whose actions are not fraudulent, we contend that our interpretation is a justifiable and necessary protection.</text>

            <text syncTime="2491.095" offset="10098944">Just a brief response.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.113" offset="10110960">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2495.815" offset="10117752">I want to point out again that in this case we have a Respondent who acknowledges that his conduct was fraudulent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2504.255" offset="10151607">Some of the rather marginal examples that have been discussed up here, I just want to remind the Court that I think it is quite unlikely that you're going to find those either being prosecuted or being prosecutable, because there is this requirement of willfulness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.883" offset="10226108">This is a separate requirement from the knowledge requirement under Section 1001, and I think it involves someone's sense of whether someone else is going to rely to their detriment on the statements he is making.</text>
            <text syncTime="2538.226" offset="10287444">I think that--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2539.178" offset="10291205">Well, ordinarily that isn't the case, Ms. Corwin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2541.578" offset="10300818">Willfulness goes to the state of mind of the person, and the element of reliance in your civil fraud action is quite different than the element of willfulness.</text>

            <label>Ms. Carolyn Corwin</label>
            <text syncTime="2551.902" offset="10342196">--Well, but I'm suggesting that in this context of false statements a person's state of mind would be affected by whether he expected that the context in which he was speaking would induce someone else to rely to their detriment or to give him a benefit based on what he was saying.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.863" offset="10413981">I think the conversation with a neighbor is one that you wash out with the willfulness requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.601" offset="10436968">I would not that you would also wipe it out with the "knew or should have known" expression, with that instruction as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.040" offset="10470719">And I would suggest to Justice Stevens that I think the question we presented in the petition, it would be our position that that would be broad enough to encompass that particular concern.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2594.313" offset="10511783">Let's just look at the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.531" offset="10520665">It says:</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.181" offset="10523277">"Whether, in a prosecution, the government must prove that the defendant knew that the statement was made in a federal matter. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.852" offset="10545951">How does that raise the instruction question?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="carolyn_corwin" startTime="2604.954" stopTime="2747.444">
            <label>Ms. Carolyn Corwin</label>
            <text syncTime="2604.954" offset="10554310">Well, I simply suggest that perhaps in looking at what "knew" means in that question, it may be appropriate to stop short of actual knowledge if the Court concludes that our initial position is incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.046" offset="10610735">I don't want to dwell on that, but I think it is simply our position that that would be broad enough to raise it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2624.265" offset="10631633">Respondent has noted the veto of the bill in 1934.</text>
            <text syncTime="2629.319" offset="10651799">I think that's significant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2630.954" offset="10658382">The veto was on the ground, President Roosevelt said you haven't done anything more in your attempted amendment here than is on the books now, and besides, you've reduced the penalties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.662" offset="10709164">Congress went back to the drawing board and, I think, looked pretty carefully at the language it was using when it then enacted the bill that became law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.434" offset="10748244">And I would note again that there is... while Congress was clearly interested in reaching the problem that was presented by the Cohn decision, the discussion on the floor does not have... or in committee, does not relate, does not mention Cohn, and does not even frame things in terms of monetary versus non-monetary interest of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.146" offset="10827133">The discussion was in terms of affording broad protection to some pretty expansive programs and to closing all the loopholes that had been creating these practical problems for the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2685.554" offset="10876766">Respondent suggests that intermediary cases are a new thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.541" offset="10896724">I don't think that's so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2692.642" offset="10905083">I think even if you look at the New Deal programs, they were using state governments under the public works program to administer some of those programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2701.248" offset="10939564">And of course, you always have the situation that was discussed earlier, in which an employee forwards information to another employee within the organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.021" offset="10978644">But the state cases call to mind the problems that have arisen in the other cases that have raised this issue, and that is the programs like Medicaid, in which individuals make statements to state agencies that are then forwarded to federal agencies and are the purpose... are the basis for providing federal funding.</text>
            <text syncTime="2731.185" offset="11059310">It is not always easy to prove, in response to Justice O'Connor's point, it is not always easy to prove in that sort of program administered by states, that an individual knew about the federal involvement.</text>
