            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="146763">We will hear arguments first this morning in Secretary of State of Maryland against Joseph Munson Company.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.997" offset="182707">Ms. Motz, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Ms. Diana Gribbon Motz</label>
            <text syncTime="15.322" offset="207994">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.899" offset="218339">All of the issues raised in this case can, I believe, be stated in a single question and that is is a state statute which only limits the amounts a charity may spend on some of its fundraising expenses and which provides the charity a complete exemption from even that limitation under certain circumstances overbroad on its face in violation of the First Amendment; that is has the statute been shown to have a substantial number of impermissible applications?</text>
            <text syncTime="47.949" offset="338502">This case comes to this Court on the Secretary of the State of Maryland's petition for certiorari asking this Court to reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals of Maryland which held such a statute facially overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.021" offset="390747">Maryland has substantial interest, both because of its parent patria responsibility with regard to charities and because of its obligations to protect its citizens to ensure the integrity of charitable organizations.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.532" offset="444872">The statute, which was invalidated by the Court below, was enacted in response to precisely these concerns as noted in its preamble for prior to its enactment in 1976 Maryland law provided, as it does now, for annual registration and disclosure of certain information by non-exempt charitable organizations and paid solicitors and for strict criminal penalties for fraudulent misrepresentation.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.878" offset="566185">However, the Maryland legislature determined that these measures were not sufficient in light of the activities of some ostensibly charitable organization that had raised millions in contributions but had such excessively high expenses that little of that money had been used for charitable purposes.</text>

            <text syncTime="128.806" offset="661898">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.369" offset="668167">I will address the standing question right now, Justice Rehnquist.</text>

            <label>Ms. Diana Gribbon Motz</label>
            <text syncTime="138.129" offset="699201">Well, Justice Rehnquist, perhaps I can address it right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.894" offset="710276">I believe there are really sort of three standing questions here before the Court today.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.831" offset="730025">There is the question of whether there is a case of controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.268" offset="739743">I don't think that there is really any dispute about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.971" offset="750610">It seems to me there clearly is.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.640" offset="757297">This is classically an adverse case.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.982" offset="766596">We have on one side the State, who has its statute declared unconstitutional, and the other side, a party which may be suffer possible criminal prosecution under the statute and which may suffer economic injury if the statute is, in fact, validated by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.883" offset="826260">The second type of standing... issue here is the jus tertii standing, the opportunity to present the rights of the Fraternal Order of Police by Munson in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.598" offset="881117">It is the State's position that there is no jus tertii standing here.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.985" offset="898672">However, I am not sure that that issue is terribly important except in one respect and that is because in any event Munson is going to have to demonstrate overbreadth and it is the State's position that there is no overbreadth standing and there is not an overbreadth challenge on the merits here.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.229" offset="975576">And, the determination of those two questions, it seems to me, are linked to the same kind of considerations.</text>

            <text syncTime="213.631" offset="1001281">Do you think the Maryland Court of Appeals' ruling on standing was based on Maryland law or on federal law?</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="225.564" offset="1048928">This is the first case in Maryland in which there was ever found any jus tertii standing, the first case.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.765" offset="1073796">And, it was based, I think, quite clearly on Craig versus Boren and a series of cases of this Court and most particularly, of course, the Schaumburg case.</text>

            <text syncTime="260.566" offset="1188944">Well, Your Honor, I think that it is very, very clear that the question of whether... The real question here is whether there is overbreadth standing.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="269.469" stopTime="273.841">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="273.841" offset="1242025">Well, I believe you do because it seems to me that whether or not there is jus tertii standing the Respondent here could make an overbreadth challenge separate and apart from any jus tertii standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.571" offset="1293016">And, it would be the State's submission that the overbreadth challenge is not a good challenge, that the merits determination on overbreadth should be a finding by this Court that this statute is not substantially overbroad and this court should do exactly what it did in New York versus Ferber.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.313" offset="1359994">That case came to you from the Court of Appeals of New York, the highest Court of the state, and that Court found that the statute was, indeed, overbroad.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.059" offset="1394998">This Court reversed and sent it back to the state court for proceedings consistent with that reversal and that is what I submit should be done here.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="320.696" offset="1429480">So, really there is no difference in your view between the standing issue and the merits issue on the overbreadth question?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="diana_gribbon_motz" startTime="326.944" stopTime="563.426">
            <label>Ms. Diana Gribbon Motz</label>
            <text syncTime="326.944" offset="1454453">It took us a long time to get there, Justice Stevens, but that is, in fact, our position now, yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.441" offset="1476500">The General Assembly, recognizing the activities of some ostensibly charitable organizations that have raised millions of dollars in contributions, but have had such excessively high expenses, that little of that money had been used for charitable purposes, enacted reform legislation, of which the statute challenged here was a principal feature, to provide a more effective regulation over fundraising expenses without imposing and intolerable burden on charity and, in the words of the preamble of the statute,</text>
            <text syncTime="370.458" offset="1628533">"to assure the contributions will be used to benefit the intended purpose. "</text>
            <text syncTime="375.629" offset="1649222">The challenged statute operates as follows: First, it provides that a charity may spend on fundraising expenses no more than 25 percent of the income raised by the fundraising activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.843" offset="1698123">The statute, however, in no way limits a charity's administrative expenses, thus, management, overhead and general staff salaries are subjected to no limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.772" offset="1741800">In addition, the Maryland statute excludes from the fundraising limitation a number of major items which are ordinarily regarded as fundraising expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.255" offset="1779730">For example, the cost of all goods, food or drink or entertainment sold or provided to the public, the cost of pre-planning and feasibility studies, and the cost of postage and printing are expressly excluded from the fundraising limitation and so may be freely incurred without limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.389" offset="1852245">Moreover, a statute can gain... a charity can gain a complete exemption from the 25 percent limitation when the limitation would effectively prevent the charity from raising contributions and this exemption may be applied for even if the charity has already exceeded the fundraising limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.630" offset="1925179">Prior to the decision in the court below, the Secretary of State's records show 14 organizations requested and exemption and 13 waivers from the 25 percent limitation were granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.719" offset="1973558">If a waiver is granted, then a charity must disclose to the public every time it solicits on the telephone, in the mail, or in person, that it has been granted a waiver from the 25 percent limitation and the amount that it has been authorized to spend or has spent on fundraising expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.542" offset="2048895">Of course, any decision denying a waiver is subject to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.415" offset="2064360">The Respondent, Joseph H. Munson Company, at whose behest, the court below held the statute I have just described unconstitutional, is an Indiana-for-profit corporation whose sole business, according to its amended bill of complaint, is to advise charitable organizations how to go about promoting an entertainment event.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.091" offset="2143041">Also according to the bill of complaint, Munson regularly collects from charities for its services more than 25 percent of the income raised by these services.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.932" offset="2186404">The firm's only client in Maryland is the Fraternal Order of Police, one of whose chapters, it has been stipulated, was reluctant to enter into a fundraising contract with Munson because of the 25 percent limitation at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.566" offset="2248993">In this respect it is significant that a number of other chapters of the same charity, the Fraternal Order of Police, have on several occasions applied for a waiver from the 25 percent limitation and on each occasion the waiver has been granted.</text>
            <text syncTime="540.968" offset="2310538">Finally, while it has been stipulated that the Fraternal Order of Police engages in the dissemination of information and the advocacy of causes on the behalf of police officers, there is no stipulation and the record shows no connection between such activities and the fundraising activities at which the Maryland statute is directed.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.335" offset="2392040">The basis upon which--</text>

            <text syncTime="563.426" offset="2400399">Ms. Motz, may I ask you whether it is your position now that there are... Are there any limits in your view on the circumstances in which the exemption is available to a charity?</text>

            <text syncTime="579.842" offset="2466123">I believe, Justice O'Connor, there are limits.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.572" offset="2476990">In our view, the exemption is only available, as it says in the statute, when the charity can show that without the exemption, with the limitation, contributions would... I don't have exactly the words of the statute here, but in those instances which the limitation would effectively prevent the charitable organization from raising contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="604.907" offset="2566329">In our view and in practice before the Secretary, it is an economic determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="610.624" offset="2589212">The Secretary has in front of her the case that the charity makes that the need the exemption for economic reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.853" offset="2650130">Now, there are any number of economic reasons for which the charity has granted the exemption, a new organization, an organization with new activities, an organization with a new program, an organization that wants to pursue a program in a different way, a one-time or extraordinary expense, any one of those kinds of things, but they are all economically grounded.</text>

            <text syncTime="1213.481" offset="5000627">Well, I would certainly hope not, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
            <text syncTime="1215.496" offset="5008673">I am dismayed that there might be a chance of that and that is why I have tried to address that point right now.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.650" offset="5033333">That is because, we submit, there are substantial, significant differences between the statute we have here and the ordinance in Schaumburg.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.396" offset="5068337">Perhaps the most obvious one is that while the Schaumburg ordinance was a direct regulation of door-to-door solicitation, conduct which has been recognized as often so intertwined with advocacy as to be protected under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.047" offset="5134897">The Maryland statute is not directed to door-to-door solicitation, but rather at charitable fundraising expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.622" offset="5161228">Fundraising, as you know, may be conducted in a variety of ways that has nothing to do with advocacy like dances, garden tours, bingo games, things like this, and, of course, the entertainment shows which are the speciality of the Respondent here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.912" offset="5222355">Now, true, fundraising may include solicitation intertwined with advocacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1275.673" offset="5249418">This is the point we were getting at earlier.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.690" offset="5257463">But, there is no showing here that any solicitation intertwined with advocacy has been or will be or is likely to be threatened by the Maryland statute or that any group engaging in any solicitation intertwined with advocacy has even needed to apply for a waiver from the fundraising limitation, let alone been denied one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1301.289" offset="5351818">The second important difference, I think, between the statute and the ordinance in Schaumburg is the situation I was discussing with Justice Powell a few minutes ago and that is the fact that the Schaumburg ordinance limited a charity to... limited its administrative as well as fundraising expenses; that is general staff salary, rents, telephones, attorney's fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.013" offset="5458815">All of those general expenses were limited by the Schaumburg ordinance as well as fundraising expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.054" offset="5490894">The Maryland statute does not attempt to limit the administrative expenses, rather it attempts to strike at the heart of the problem of excessive fundraising without unduly intruding into the internal affairs of a charitable organization by limiting only fundraising expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.515" offset="5560797">Thirdly, the Schaumburg ordinance required a charity, prior to any solicitation, to obtain a permit and in order to obtain the permit the charity had to prove that at least 75 percent of its income in the previous year had been used directly for charitable purposes, thus, there was no way a charity could, in the words of this Court, alter its spending patterns in the short term to comply with the 75 percent requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.801" offset="5681901">The Maryland statute imposes neither of these serious burdens on a charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.035" offset="5698828">First, it does not require a charity to prove compliance with the percentage limitation prior to engaging in fundraising activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.842" offset="5738116">And, second, the Maryland statute allows a charity to apply the limitation retrospectively on an annual or a campaign-by-campaign basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1408.152" offset="5779285">So that even in a short run, a charity can, indeed, alter its spending patterns to comply with the Maryland statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.243" offset="5803632">Fourth, the Schaumburg ordinance flatly bans the solicitation by charities that spent more than a certain percentage on non-program expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.410" offset="5844383">In contrast, the Maryland statute simply subjects expenses in excess of the percentage limitation to scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.547" offset="5876879">If a charity can demonstrate the limitation effectively prevents it from raising funds, it can obtain a complete exemption from the waiver, something that was simply impossible under the Schaumburg ordinance.</text>

            <text syncTime="1539.453" offset="6304556">It tells people that and then it immediately invites questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.296" offset="6323886">And, the person who is often doing the soliciting is either a volunteer, who doesn't know very much about the innerworkings of the charity or why the 10 percent is high or the 10 percent is low, or a paid solicitor paid at a minimum wage rate whose in the same situation, although for different reasons, and it is the charities themselves who have almost across-the-board... I notice they don't say it in their amici briefs to this Court, but they have, for example, testified before the Maryland General Assembly that disclosure requirements, point of solicitation disclosure requirements raise more questions than they answer and, therefore, put an undue burden on the charity and don't give the public the real story.</text>
            <text syncTime="1586.731" offset="6493682">Now I think there is some truth in that, Your Honor.</text>

            <text syncTime="1600.413" offset="6548330">And, we believe the statute we have here does not impose very much burden, more burden on charities than that would.</text>
            <text syncTime="1608.646" offset="6581245">Finally, it is the State's position that the court below not only erred in failing to recognize the substantive differences between the ordinance struck down in Schaumburg and the statute involved here, but it also failed to apply the correct test of validity, the test that was applied by this Court in Schaumburg, the substantial overbreadth test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.243" offset="6671733">In Schaumburg this Court held the ordinance bad because it constituted a substantial limitation on protected activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1638.426" offset="6700467">Subsequent to the decision in Schaumburg, this Court has reiterated the test of substantiality in New York versus Ferber where it said that a statute would be stricken as overbroad under the First Amendment only if it were shown to have a substantial number of impermissible applications.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.589" offset="6765042">There is no showing in this case that the Maryland statute has had, will have, or is likely to have any impermissible applications.</text>

            <text syncTime="3671.382" offset="15277721">You will remember in Schaumburg, the Village asserted that defraud interest, and they asserted that those people who spent more than 25 percent on non-charity expenses were fraudulent in representing themselves as a charity.</text>
            <text syncTime="3689.218" offset="15277617">The State of Maryland makes no such contention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3692.747" offset="15277512">Indeed, what this statute is trying to reach is the use of charitable contributions for non-charitable purposes, something which may not necessarily be and which probably in many instances is not criminal, fraudulent misrepresentation under an ordinary fraud statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3720.504" offset="15277408">What it is, we submit, is something which entitles the state to be on notice as to the activities of the organization and to scrutinize those activities when their fundraising expenses are more than 25 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3737.291" offset="15277303">And, that is precisely what the Maryland statute does.</text>
            <text syncTime="3740.259" offset="15277199">It does not assume that those activities are fraudulent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3743.945" offset="15277094">What it does is assume that they are entitled to be scrutinized by the state and if the charity makes a showing that, indeed, those expenses are reasonable, it may go out and continue to solicit provided it discloses that to the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="3757.908" offset="15276990">And, if it does not make that showing then it is not entitled to solicit.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.050" offset="15276885">Of course, that decision goes to judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="3764.736" offset="15276781">We believe in that way, without imposing any great burden on the charity, we have protected the potential donor, the intended beneficiary, and we have, in general, benefited charity by insuring the appearance as well as the reality of integrity charitable organizations.</text>
