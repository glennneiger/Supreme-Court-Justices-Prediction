            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="152777">We'll hear arguments next in Nix against Williams.</text>

            <label>Mr. Brent R. Appel</label>
            <text syncTime="48.703" offset="347546">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="51.525" offset="358831">This is the second time this case has been here, and so the Court is fully familiar with the underlying facts.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.609" offset="383177">But this time it comes here in a very different analytical posture.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.522" offset="398850">In the first case, as you recall, highly probative testimony about the fact that the witness in the back seat of a car made incriminating statements that ultimately led police to the body of a murder victim was suppressed on the ground that the Respondent's Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.782" offset="463843">After this Court set aside the first conviction, Respondent was retried and this time medical testimony about the fact of the body's discovery, the fact that the body was dead, and the fact that the body showed evidence of sexual abuse, and the fact that the body appeared to have been suffocated was introduced in the record on an inevitable discovery theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.617" offset="551197">And the State believes that in this particular case if the Court keeps focus on the fact that this is an independent source case with a twist, the twist of inevitable discovery, it's readily disposed of in favor of the Petitioner.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.747" offset="611696">It is not an attenuation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.078" offset="620996">It is not a good faith exception to the exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.050" offset="632908">And it is emphatically not an attempt to relitigate Williams I.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.862" offset="652134">Let's review the facts on Williams II.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.245" offset="665717">Inevitable discovery is the exception used to admit the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.629" offset="683272">200 volunteers were sweeping across an area in central Iowa, looking in ditches along Interstate 80 for the body of the murder victim.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.654" offset="715350">It's in the record under Detective Ruxlow's testimony exactly what the contours of this search were.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.886" offset="736248">But the volunteers were expressly directed to look in hidden parts of ditches for the body.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="151.159" offset="757355">Is it true, as the Respondent states, that the scope of the search was to stop at the county line?</text>

            <label>Mr. Brent R. Appel</label>
            <text syncTime="158.335" offset="786090">The testimony in the record is flatly to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.976" offset="796643">Detective Ruxlow, who was in charge of the search, stated that the search was going to continue into Polk County.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.881" offset="824228">And that makes logical sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.411" offset="830393">If the body had not been discovered and the search had already continued for a period of 60 miles, 7 miles north and 7 miles south of the interstate, they surely would have continued the search on into the YMCA, which is where the abduction ultimately occurred.</text>

            <label>Mr. Brent R. Appel</label>
            <text syncTime="215.521" offset="1014818">--That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.823" offset="1020042">And I submit to you, because this is an independent source case, that good faith is not an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.586" offset="1051076">In fact, this search is analytically entirely distinct from the conduct that occurred in the automobile as the Respondent was transported from Davenport to Des Moines.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.055" offset="1092976">Now, we've had suggestions in Respondent's brief that a Sixth Amendment claim is involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.678" offset="1115441">Let me point out to you that the ability of the Respondent to cross-examine the witnesses at trial who testified with respect to the medical condition of the body was fully protected.</text>
            <text syncTime="252.596" offset="1163089">In fact, if you glance at the trial record you'll see not only was there rigorous cross-examination of the coroner who testified about the condition of the body, but the defense introduced three medical witnesses to attempt to build a case in a different direction from that of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.084" offset="1217110">And to show that there is no Sixth Amendment violation independently here in the admission of medical testimony, I submit to you the following hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.400" offset="1254308">Supposing an attorney was traveling in the car with Respondent and fully protecting his rights under Miranda, Fifth Amendment rights and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="288.049" offset="1304881">It would not have made any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="290.240" offset="1313659">Three courts that have considered the matter... the state trial court, the Iowa Supreme Court, which reviews constitutional issues de novo, and the federal district court... have said that the body would have been discovered in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.160" offset="1365381">Indeed, if Respondent was still at large the body would have been discovered in any event, according to the findings of the three courts that have considered the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.648" offset="1399340">And so I submit to you that the right to counsel has been fully protected in this case, and that the only rationale for exclusion of this highly probative and reliable evidence must be found really elsewhere; perhaps some generalized notion of protection of the adversary process.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Brent R. Appel</label>
            <text syncTime="334.712" offset="1491605">The Eighth Circuit opinion basically says, if I can characterize it correctly, that in order to invoke inevitable discovery the State has the burden of showing absence of bad faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.379" offset="1538207">Then the Eighth Circuit said: Look, in Massiah, in the Massiah analysis, we look to the subjective intent of the officer, and that is whether the officer intended to elicit information in the absence of counsel, and therefore we must reverse.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.788" offset="1591915">It was almost a collateral estoppel theory, Justice Rehnquist.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.842" offset="2044042">Now, admittedly we can't tell this with mathematical precision because we can't remake history, but that's not unusual in the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="481.318" offset="2078001">For instance, take the Wade-Gilbert-Stovall trilogy.</text>
            <text syncTime="485.041" offset="2092839">A pretrial identification has occurred and there's nothing we can do to back up and undo the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.234" offset="2117708">But instead, we allow independent testimony in court not based on the tainted identification.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.399" offset="2150308">There's no psychological laser that can beam that out of the mind of the witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.954" offset="2168490">Similarly in the Franks v. Delaware context, where we allow... we examine a search warrant where there's been perjured or false information in a search warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.137" offset="2205270">We attempt to... we can't reconstruct the transaction.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.061" offset="2216973">We can't tell for sure whether a federal magistrate would have issued a warrant with the faulty material excised.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.425" offset="2246439">But we make a judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.875" offset="2252186">And I think it's very clear in this Court's precedents that the mere fact you can't show mathematical certainty ought not defeat the position of the State.</text>
            <text syncTime="535.973" offset="2296594">I want to contrast this case sharply with the Dunaway type situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.406" offset="2322299">In Dunaway, as you recall, you have a situation where there's no probable cause to arrest, admittedly.</text>
            <text syncTime="549.372" offset="2350197">The police say they don't.</text>

            <text syncTime="560.719" offset="2395650">The Court in Dunaway pointed out that this was a specific bootstrap, that they went out, they arrested the person without probable cause with a view to trying to cleanse the transaction with Miranda and seeing if evidence could be garnered.</text>

            <text syncTime="737.444" offset="3102524">That amounts to a penalty on law enforcement.</text>
            <text syncTime="740.538" offset="3114854">All the Petitioner asks here is to put law enforcement back in the status quo before the unconstitutional violation occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="747.972" offset="3144633">This Court has never applied the exclusionary rule, to the best of my knowledge, in a context that in fact puts law enforcement in a position that's worse off.</text>
            <text syncTime="758.218" offset="3185593">And it seems to me that Michigan v. Tucker is entirely instructive in that particular point.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.262" offset="3209730">In Michigan and Tucker, as you know, there was a Miranda warning that was defective.</text>
            <text syncTime="772.209" offset="3241600">It was defective in the sense that the accused was not informed of the right to counsel should he be indigent, and various incriminating statements were obtained from the accused.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.995" offset="3288725">In that case this Court held, number one, the right to counsel was not infracted.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.738" offset="3307637">Why?</text>
            <text syncTime="789.599" offset="3311086">Because when Hennessey appeared in a court of law his attorney was able to fully cross-examine the derivative evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.484" offset="3342641">Number two, in Michigan v. Tucker it was said, since the direct evidence was suppressed, i.e. the fact that the witness made the statements, that was sufficient deterrence.</text>
            <text syncTime="808.881" offset="3388199">The marginal deterrence that might have been obtained was certainly not worth the candle.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.445" offset="3406485">In this particular case, evidence of the most highly probative character, the fact that the Respondent actually led police to the body and therefore knew personally of the whereabouts, has already been suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.452" offset="3458521">No additional Sixth Amendment right to counsel has been infracted.</text>
            <text syncTime="830.195" offset="3473463">This is not an attenuation case.</text>
            <text syncTime="833.618" offset="3487151">We hear in the Respondent's brief citations to Brown v. Illinois and to Dunaway.</text>
            <text syncTime="840.622" offset="3515259">Again, this is an independent source case, with a bit of a twist.</text>
            <text syncTime="844.715" offset="3531559">This Court has not yet had the opportunity to hold that inevitable discovery applies in a context where an independent investigation is on the verge of discovery, though in Crews v. United States, part D of the opinion, that three Justices signed, we come very close where the three Justices note that, notwithstanding the fact that the identification of the accused was made through an illegal arrest, there was already an ongoing investigation and it had focused on the suspect, who was down at the Washington Monument, and the evidence was within the grasp of police.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.836" offset="3668023">In the attenuation cases it's like dominoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.050" offset="3680875">There is causation.</text>
            <text syncTime="882.570" offset="3682965">There's no independent ongoing investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="885.651" offset="3695295">And at some stage we say, hey, there's too many dominoes, 50 dominoes, 100 dominoes, and it gets too far down the line to say that the evidence was obtained at exploitation of the underlying conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.599" offset="3743151">And probably where there's a live witness involved that counts for 50 dominoes.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.862" offset="3760183">But in this particular case, once again, law enforcement does not have the ability to manipulate the variables like you might in an attenuation case, like in Dunaway.</text>
            <text syncTime="912.339" offset="3802083">It would be an odd rule of law that said, well, go ahead and arrest without probable cause, cleanse it with Miranda and then see what drops out.</text>
            <text syncTime="921.055" offset="3836983">That might be an incentive for unlawful conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.568" offset="3847014">But that is emphatically not the case here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Brent R. Appel</label>
            <text syncTime="968.906" offset="4028304">And that is a matter for the trial court to find, much as in an independent source case, much as in a Kastigar type case, where use immunity has been conferred and then the prosecution comes in and proves in a court of law the independent character of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="983.395" offset="4086295">So I think it's very clear, as we focus on this particular case, that what occurred in Williams I is not relevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.864" offset="4136137">It has nothing to do with the independent source here.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.936" offset="4148467">Now, I want to contrast once again our setting with another setting that may be causing the Justices some difficulty, and that's Griffin v. United States, the Circuit Court case cited in the brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.793" offset="4199876">What basically Griffin is concerned about is a search warrant setting, where an officer is at the door without a warrant, no exigent circumstances are present justifying immediate entry, and says: Aha, we need to get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1025.293" offset="4253897">I've got probable cause, I know I've got probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.235" offset="4265704">If the rule of law was that I could break in and enter this establishment without a warrant and then later come into a court in a bootstrap fashion and say, hey, we had probable cause, it would have been inevitably discovered, once again that would threaten to eviscerate the Fourth Amendment warrant requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1045.205" offset="4333518">But in that particular case there is no independent avenue of discovery of the evidence and all the variables are within the control of the officer on site.</text>
            <text syncTime="1056.992" offset="4380643">And so I would sharply distinguish both Dunaway and the Griffin type situation from the present case at bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.967" offset="4412617">Now, I think it's clear that there is a sense that the courts, the trial courts, are going to have to make a factual determination here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1077.987" offset="4464653">Once again, that is not unusual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.079" offset="4477087">Since the very days of the independent source rule, since Silverthorne, courts have time in and time out been making the determination of independent source.</text>
            <text syncTime="1091.658" offset="4519406">And I might add, in Silverthorne, the search there was made without apparent authority, and I would substitute a word for that: flagrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1100.741" offset="4555664">It was wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.333" offset="4562037">We don't have much of the facts of Silverthorne admittedly, but Justice Holmes simply says it was without apparent authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="1107.586" offset="4583040">And it seems to me clear that good faith is not relevant in that setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1112.830" offset="4604042">Another case that I want to cite... this is... what I'm asking for is simply weaving together the traditional strands of this Court's precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1120.885" offset="4636225">Though the Court hasn't had an opportunity to expressly embrace inevitable discovery, it's entirely consistent.</text>

            <text syncTime="1203.300" offset="4965890">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1206.252" offset="4977698">The inevitable discovery doctrine, as Mr. Appel has pointed out, balances the same competing interests that this Court's independent source doctrine has served for years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.050" offset="5024927">On the one hand, it's the Court's duty to make sure that the police don't benefit from illegal conduct; and on the other hand, it's also the Court's duty to make sure that society's interest in convicting guilty defendants isn't frustrated by keeping reliable and untainted evidence from a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="1235.741" offset="5095667">The inevitable discovery doctrine accomplishes both of these purposes, as it has in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.537" offset="5122834">Evidence that's been obtained only as a result of the Sixth Amendment violation has been suppressed from the retrial in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1250.701" offset="5155539">But evidence that the police would have found anyway, as three courts have found in this case, is properly admitted because the competing policy interests that I've mentioned are fully served by putting the police and the Defendant back in the position they would have occupied had there been no illegality.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.904" offset="5228369">I'd like to address... add to one point that Mr. Appel made about the fact that this started off as a Sixth Amendment case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.318" offset="5262015">The Respondent's argument in his brief seems to be that because this is the Sixth Amendment rather than the Fourth Amendment, that the inevitable discovery doctrine can never apply to this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.056" offset="5308930">What he really seems to be arguing is that there's no cure for the violation this Court found in Brewer versus Williams and that because he won that case he should automatically win this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.923" offset="5352398">But I would point out that this Court's decision in United States versus Morrison established that victims of Sixth Amendment violations are no more entitled to automatic remedies than victims of Fourth Amendment violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.253" offset="5405688">The Court's language in Morrison was to note that its task is to identify and neutralize the taint and limit the remedy to making sure that the Government is deprived of the fruits of its transgression, and that's exactly what was done in the retrial of this case, when all trades of the Sixth Amendment violation in Brewer versus Williams were purged from the second trial and the second trial proceeded as essentially an entirely different case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.780" offset="5519895">I'd like to address the two major objections that are most often voiced at the inevitable discovery doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.317" offset="5558034">The first is that it undermines the deterrent rationale for the exclusionary rule and the second is that it forces courts to engage in too much speculation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.392" offset="5598263">Concern about the deterrent effect of the exclusionary rule was what led the Court of Appeals to impose a good faith requirement, or what it called the absence of bad faith, as an element of the inevitable discovery doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1375.621" offset="5655210">But from a practical standpoint the deterrence rationale and the absence of bad faith simply doesn't bear, in our view, any logical relationship to the inevitable discovery doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.661" offset="5707350">The argument seems to be that if there's no good faith requirement then the police would be encouraged to commit constitutional violations by taking shortcuts that would save them time and money, on the theory that they would know there'd be no penalty attached to it because later the prosecution could get the evidence in under inevitable discovery.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.127" offset="5797211">That seems to us not very logical thinking to assume that a policeman would engage in, and in fact it seems to us that his thinking would be just the opposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="1421.152" offset="5837335">The more likely a policeman is certain that the evidence he wants can be obtained lawfully, the less incentive there is for him to commit a deliberate constitutional violation, because if he does so he knows that he's risking the prosecution, he's risking personal liability, disciplinary actions or civil damages suits against him, and he knows that there's no need to do it because he's convinced that the evidence he wants can be obtained through lawful means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1452.073" offset="5961051">Now, on the other hand, if he's not certain that the evidence he wants can be obtained lawfully, then again there's no incentive for him to resort to illegal conduct because he'll have no confidence, no reason for confidence, that the prosecution would be able to successfully make use of the inevitable discovery doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1470.454" offset="6034508">So in either event we think it's just not a rational prediction of how policemen would think to assume that if the inevitable discovery doctrine is embraced by this Court it would encourage police to take unconstitutional shortcuts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1487.226" offset="6101590">I also agree fully with Mr. Appel that from an analytical perspective good faith is completely irrelevant to the inevitable discovery doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.002" offset="6136699">The whole premise of the doctrine is that the initial taint, whether Sixth Amendment or Fourth Amendment violation, has been purged and the evidence in the retrial is admitted--</text>

            <text syncTime="2127.322" offset="8662008">But my recollection of Morrison was that the issue was whether an interference with communications and relationship between attorney and the accused was going to result in dismissal of the indictment, and what this Court said was that sanction was not necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="2148.938" offset="8748526">Now, that's completely consistent with the view that what the right to counsel at the pretrial stages is all about is to protect the defendant from having the state elicit from him for use at trial some evidence without his having the assistance of a lawyer who can advise him about the consequences of giving that kind of information and his rights with regard to giving that kind of information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2180.608" offset="8875167">And it's the use at trial that constitutes the completion, at least, of that Sixth Amendment violation, and inherently therefore this Sixth Amendment right to counsel includes an exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2194.496" offset="8930756">It's the very purpose of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2196.489" offset="8938697">Now, a consequence of that is that the primary purpose of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel at interrogation is not to deter police misconduct in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.539" offset="9006929">This Court indicated in Massiah and in Weatherford that there's really no constitutional violation if the police sit the defendant down and interrogate him without counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2224.658" offset="9051337">That's fine, as long as they don't use it against him at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.013" offset="9076728">So there's no deterrent purpose, at least in a primary sense, and consequently the deterrence analysis on which the State seeks to justify the hypothetical probable discovery doctrine here is really beside the point.</text>

            <text syncTime="2789.388" offset="11310302">We have Ruxlow's testimony, Ruxlow that was told what this hearing was about before he testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2796.461" offset="11338619">He was told they needed his testimony to show that his search would have produced the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.774" offset="11359830">He testified falsely about Exhibit D, and his testimony that the search would have continued into Polk County is inconsistent with all of the historical facts that we have about what happened.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.924" offset="11412388">Agent Ruxlow's report about his search effort says that he was to search Poweshiek and Jasper Counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2821.899" offset="11440287">It never even mentions Polk County.</text>
            <text syncTime="2824.681" offset="11451468">The search proceeded exactly to the Jasper-Polk County border and then Ruxlow abandoned it, with three hours of daylight left, with all of the searchers assembled, he admitted for no purpose known to him except to follow Detective Leaming and, as he finally admitted, well before Mr. Williams indicated that he would take the police to the body.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.048" offset="11572885">If he planned to go into Polk County with this search, why not at 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon on December 26th when all of the searchers were assembled?</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.738" offset="11623667">Now, my point is that there are serious questions raised about this, and it illustrates one of the difficulties, one of the practical, pragmatic difficulties with the so-called inevitable discovery doctrine, and that is that one ends up having to resolve hypothetical disputes on the basis of post hoc rationalization and when the state can effectively call an officer in and have him say what would have happened because by and large historical facts don't stand in the way.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.547" offset="11794926">That brings me, unless there are other questions on the merits, to the Stone versus Powell issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2921.263" offset="11837766">Again, the Sixth Amendment nature of this case provides the clearest, most efficient route to a decision on that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.079" offset="11881025">Stone versus Powell was a Fourth Amendment decision and the analysis of the Court in that case was based entirely on the deterrent effect, the deterrent function I should say, of the Fourth Amendment exclusionary rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2951.063" offset="11956989">The Court made it clear that it was not a decision that had anything to do with the scope of habeas corpus generally.</text>

            <text syncTime="2971.976" offset="12040581">Certainly that part would carry over to this case, would it not?</text>

            <text syncTime="3822.622" offset="15443187">Mr. Chief Justice:</text>
            <text syncTime="3823.833" offset="15448098">It seems to me clear that we would have to rewrite a number of the cases in order to sustain Petitioner's position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3830.626" offset="15475265">Michigan v. Tucker, where it was held that the testimony from the additional witness found did not violate Sixth Amendment rights because of the full possibility to cross-examine, is a case involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="3844.748" offset="15531690">The Court would do well to recognize Justice Frankfurter's admonition that facts do not become sacred and inaccessible simply because of underlying conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3854.691" offset="15571500">There is no Sixth Amendment violation here from the introduction of the evidence where the Respondent's counsel's role as legal strategist, as discussed in the Ashe case, is fully preserved, as it has been here, and as a result the admission of testimony about the body was a hard blow, but not a constitutionally foul one.</text>
            <text syncTime="3874.757" offset="15651748">And in closing, this is not the kind of case where a police officer can manipulate the law, i.e., cleanse an illegal transaction with Miranda in order to obtain some kind of collateral purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="3887.955" offset="15704516">And I submit to you that this is not the kind of case, if you sustain the Petitioner's position, that will provide some kind of inducement for law enforcement to substitute brawn for brains as a key instrumentality of crime detection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3901.414" offset="15758433">For the above reasons, I respectfully submit that the decision must be reversed.</text>
