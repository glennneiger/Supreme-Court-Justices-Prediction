            <text syncTime="19.645" offset="210486">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="23.180" offset="224592">As in the cases we heard this morning this case involves in personam jurisdiction over my client Helicol.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.637" offset="262418">Helicol is a foreign corporation in the true sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="37.439" offset="281644">It is a company organized existing in the country of Colombia, and its sole business is the transportation of persons principally in South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.516" offset="333889">The jurisdictional issue in this case arises in the context of a wrongful death action which was brought in the State Court of Texas by the family of Dean Hall and several other families who were killed in an accident that occurred in Peru.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.096" offset="416227">Helicol had entered into a contract with American construction companies known as Williams-Sedco-Horn, and this contract was executed in Peru and it was designed to be performed in Peru.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.372" offset="485294">In the course of this helicopter operation it was necessary for the operation of the contract that Williams-Sedco-Horn had with the government of Peru, and they were building a pipeline from the jungles of Peru to the Pacific Ocean.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.535" offset="565961">They needed Helicol to transport workers from construction sites to base terminals in Peru.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.791" offset="603054">On the course of one of these trips an accident occurred in which the Respondents' decedents were killed along with two other passengers who are not involved in this law suit or this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.955" offset="675675">The case was brought in the state court of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.157" offset="696468">The only contacts that Helicol had with the State of Texas was established in the course of the hearing on a preliminary motion on jurisdiction was the fact that Helicol had a single contract discussion with the personnel of Williams-Sedco-Horn in Houston, Texas, and also in the course of five or six years prior to that contract they purchased equipment from an American manufacturer, Bell Helicopter Company.</text>

            <text syncTime="311.516" offset="1377951">What we are dealing here if Your Honor please is not a case of contacts in a jurisdiction which gave rise to a cause of action.</text>

            <text syncTime="708.858" offset="2967241">If the position that the Supreme Court of Texas is to be upheld that the purchases of $4 million worth of equipment from an American vendor which is the principle contact which the Supreme Court of Texas relied on for general jurisdiction then it would appear that any time a foreign company purchased American products from an American vendor no matter what its extent that if there is a cause of action which is unrelated to those purchases that foreign purchaser could be dragged into American litigation and all the expenses involved in it solely because of the purchase of American products.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.729" offset="3210806">As the United States government in this case succinctly but pointedly established this would as a policy matter be against the export policy of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.108" offset="3280292">In the decisions of this Court certain policy matters have entered into the decisions as to whether there should be or should not be jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="799.416" offset="3329507">One of the policy matters in some of the cases has been the residence of the Plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="807.504" offset="3361899">I should point out in this case that none of the Respondents were residents of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.027" offset="3391992">So we have in this case Plaintiffs who are nonresidents of Texas suing a company which is not based in Texas on a cause of action which occurred in Peru, and as the Supreme Court and the Respondents acknowledge there is no connection between the contacts of Helicol in Texas and the ultimate cause of action which was brought against Helicol in the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="846.479" offset="3517797">The decisions of this Court from International Shoe through Volkswagen have emphasized that there must be a relationship between the parties, the litigation and the forum if jurisdiction is to be established over a nonresident who is not based in the forum state.</text>
            <text syncTime="875.399" offset="3633468">In this case I suggest to Your Honors that Helicol in no way was based in Texas, and lacking that finding which the Supreme Court of Texas acknowledged there can be no basis for in personam jurisdiction over Helicol on an unrelated cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="897.431" offset="3721552">I think this Court respectfully is bound by the findings of the Supreme Court and of the Court of Civil Appeals that the cause of action in this case did not arise out of the contacts of Helicol in Texas.</text>

            <text syncTime="914.191" offset="3788635">Mr. Whalen, are there any circumstances in which a purchaser or a buyer of goods in the forum state would be sufficient simply because of the quantity purchased, let's say, or the frequency of that occasion to provide general jurisdiction over that buyer?</text>

            <text syncTime="936.723" offset="3878705">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.425" offset="3889572">If the business of the company was the buying and selling of helicopter equipment and that the company went into Texas to buy equipment for the purpose of reselling it then in that case I would suggest that that company by buying that equipment would be doing some business under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="967.242" offset="4000854">But whereas Helicol was buying capital goods for the use of its business in South America its business is not buying and selling equipment.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.816" offset="4043172">Its business is transporting people in South America.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.768" offset="4058950">So the purchase of capital goods I suggest to the Court cannot be the basis for a finding of doing business, and I believe that this was the gist of Justice Brandeis' decision in the Rosenberg case which I've cited in my brief in which he points out that purchases are not doing business.</text>

Those purchases plus other contacts would form a basis for jurisdiction because the cause of action arose out of those contacts.</text>

            <text syncTime="1243.221" offset="5104788">My clients it is true were not residents of the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.095" offset="5148256">Their relationship with the State of Texas was purely with Williams-Sedco-Horn which was domiciled in the State of Texas in Houston.</text>
            <text syncTime="1265.986" offset="5195799">These four men were employed in Texas by Williams-Sedco-horn to work over in Peru.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.776" offset="5238953">My clients had absolutely nothing to do with any of the Helicol contacts with the State of Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1287.400" offset="5281481">They came into the State of Texas based upon the record in this case, and the discovery was limited to that area of time from 1970 when the helicopter which crashed in Peru was purchased in Texas up until the time of the special appearance motion being heard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1312.032" offset="5380014">Helicol came into the State of Texas for far greater reasons than simply to buy some helicopters and some helicopter parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1322.907" offset="5423482">In addition to purchasing the helicopter which crashed this company purchased approximately 80 percent of its fleet, and it purchased virtually all of the parts that were necessary to keep that fleet going.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.901" offset="5495476">They also had pilots who were trained in the State of Texas, and they also had their maintenance personnel who were trained in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.009" offset="5535913">They did not stay in Colombia and order helicopters and parts from the State of Texas and then wait for them to be delivered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1362.032" offset="5580008">They sent their people to Texas and they sent their people from the head man in that company, Mr. Restrepo, the executive vice president, the head of the maintenance department of that company as well as their pilots and their maintenance personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1380.545" offset="5653987">The records in this case will indicate that there were some 33 different business trips taken to the State of Texas by various officials and employees of this company.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.705" offset="5714695">Now when this incident occurred in Peru the Plaintiffs were immediately faced with one fundamental problem and that was where could their rights be determined.</text>

            <text syncTime="2329.702" offset="9450623">It is also true that the helicopter company's claim of defective helicopter was also not such as to raise a fact issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.510" offset="9505899">A case such as this is almost a certainty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.848" offset="9531290">When a helicopter flies into a tree in a fog and all hands are killed either there was pilot error, there was a problem with the contractor pressuring the flying company to fly in that weather, or there was something wrong with the helicopter.</text>

            <text syncTime="2444.222" offset="9908707">Yes, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.158" offset="9916439">My adversary in this case apparently is prepared to have the case decided on the Perkins case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.614" offset="9962310">He says that this case is identical to the Perkins case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.768" offset="9982894">The facts in the Perkins case are that it was a company that was principally doing business in the Philippines and because of the war in effect had to leave the Philippines and set up operations in Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.896" offset="10051440">The president was there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.765" offset="10062934">They actually operated business, all kinds of business, from Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.501" offset="10085817">They had employees, payroll, bank account, offices, employees located there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2494.139" offset="10108387">They had set up shop, and the position I think of this Court in the Perkins case was as a commentator says it is never a violation of due process for a defendant to be sued in his own backyard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.367" offset="10177350">In that case the defendant had in effect set up an office.</text>
            <text syncTime="2516.469" offset="10197726">He was equivalent to a domiciliary and under those circumstances a defendant should be subject to suit on any cause of action, and that is essentially what this Court held in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2531.478" offset="10257807">Perkins came after International Shoe and Perkins was in a sense signaled by International Shoe because the language in International Shoe suggested that there would be circumstances in which the contacts were so great they were substantial, continuous, systematic doing business that the cause of action would not necessarily have to arise out of those facts in order as a matter of due process jurisdiction could be had.</text>
            <text syncTime="2567.770" offset="10402943">I would like to point out to the Court this Court in International Shoe cited the Rosenberg case, cited it indicating that it still had strength even after International Shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.047" offset="10468041">I would point out in Rosenberg and to this extent Rosenberg may very well have been changed to some extent by International Shoe.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.755" offset="10506911">In that case the cause of action arose out of the conduct in New York although it is not clear from the facts as to whether it arose out of the purchases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.777" offset="10551006">Notwithstanding the fact in Rosenberg that the cause of action arose out of conduct in the State of New York, the Court in that case said that purchases... the purchase of a significant amount of capital as well as inventory is not sufficient to form basis for jurisdiction over that defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2628.059" offset="10644106">I think my adversary's position in this case is simply that he represents United States citizens and that his court, the Texas court, should provide a forum somewhere in this country--</text>

            <text syncTime="2671.321" offset="10817141">There are no minimum contacts as I understand the doctrine of minimum contacts from International Shoe that the cause of action simply did not arise out of those contacts.</text>
