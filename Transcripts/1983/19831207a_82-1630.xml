            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="142900">We'll hear arguments next in Hudson against Palmer and the consolidated case.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.288" offset="183964">Mr. Broaddus, you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. William G. Broaddus</label>
            <text syncTime="63.954" offset="398691">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="69.377" offset="420320">The two petitions in this case bring before this Court two important constitutional issues pertaining to prison administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="77.423" offset="452503">The first issue, that presented by the Petitioner, is whether a prison inmate has some reasonable and legitimate expectation of privacy while in prison so that he is entitled to the protection of the Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendments against allegedly unreasonable searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.106" offset="531289">The second issue, that presented by the Cross Petitioner, is whether a prison inmate whose property has been destroyed by the random unauthorized but unanticipated act of a guard has in law been deprived of property without due process when the state provides adequate post-deprivation remedies which are adequate to make the inmate whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.796" offset="654064">These issues arose out of an incident which occurred at Bland Correctional Institution in September, 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.891" offset="686456">Bland is a state run penal facility which houses 450 felons.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.015" offset="706936">According to the inmate's complaint the prison guard conducted a shakedown, that is, a search of his locker but the shakedown was not routine and was conducted for purposes of harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.923" offset="758554">He further alleged that the guard destroyed some of his property.</text>
            <text syncTime="159.396" offset="780392">Although the guard denied these allegations the District Court accepted them as true for purposes of ruling upon the guard's motion for summary judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.613" offset="817277">The trial court concluded that the allegations of deprivation of property did not constitute a taking without due process because of this Court's reasoning in the case of Parratt v. Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.352" offset="872239">The trial court also concluded that the allegations of harassment did not rise to the level of a constitutional violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.657" offset="901496">The Court of Appeals affirmed both of those rulings.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.100" offset="915289">The Court of Appeals found that the inmate had some minimal right of privacy entitled to protection under the Fourteenth Amendment, and the Court of Appeals ruled that a guard could not search unless there was an established program or policy for random searches or in the alternative that the guard had some reasonable basis for believing that the prisoner possessed contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.728" offset="1029809">The Petitioner submits the Court of Appeals erred with respect to this conclusion, and I would like first to address this issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.854" offset="1066276">It is clear from this Court's prior opinions that an iron curtain does not exist between the Constitution and our nation's prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.730" offset="1109744">It is equally clear, however, that prisoners suffer a substantial reduction and even loss in many rights and privileges.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.376" offset="1144330">In each case before the Court determines that an inmate possesses a right it carefully weighs that claim in light of the acute need of prison administration for prison security because that is the paramount need which prison administration is charged with.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.442" offset="1232624">Secondarily, it will weigh the claim in light of the effect upon the prison inmate.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.844" offset="1262195">With respect to the claim that a prison inmate possesses a right of privacy this Court is well aware from its many cases that prisons are dangerous places.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.934" offset="1314544">They are used to house dangerous men.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.898" offset="1330427">Inmates may seek to assault, to brutalize other inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.939" offset="1354564">They may seek to assault guards.</text>
            <text syncTime="305.353" offset="1364281">They may seek to escape.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.174" offset="1371596">The introduction of drugs and weapons into this situation can only exacerbate an already dangerous place and situation.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="324.233" offset="1439827">As I understood your opening statement you were suggesting that the Fourth Amendment has no application to searches in the prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="331.189" offset="1467622">You also say that there is no protection for the prisoner against seizures in searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.541" offset="1484967">I notice the complaint alleges that the officer shook down my locker and destroyed a lot of my property, that is, legal materials, letters and other personal property.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.477" offset="1520807">It is not so much the search as the destruction of property.</text>
            <text syncTime="347.750" offset="1533868">Is there a protection against unreasonable seizures... That is what I am asking... as opposed to searches.</text>

            <label>Mr. William G. Broaddus</label>
            <text syncTime="353.073" offset="1555184">Justice Stevens, with respect to the destruction of property aspect, that, of course, will be controlled by Parrat v. Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.457" offset="1580680">With respect to the seizure of property we would submit that because there is no legitimate expectation or right of privacy that the Fourth Amendment does not apply and that, therefore, a seizure would not be controlled by the Fourth Amendment but by some other aspect, if at all, such as the taking of property without due process.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="383.703" stopTime="407.168">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="383.703" offset="1677646">Mr. Broaddus, I suppose that if I am a policeman and you are a suspect I may have a probable cause that would justify my searching for and seizing a gold ring in your possession that is maybe worth $20,000, but the fact I may seize it in the Fourth Amendment sense does not justify me in keeping it.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="407.168" stopTime="410.250">
            <label>Mr. William G. Broaddus</label>
            <text syncTime="407.168" offset="1771478">That is correct.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="410.250" stopTime="417.696">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="410.250" offset="1783808">That is what you meant by the Parrat rather than Fourth Amendment being applicable to the property destruction?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="william_g_broaddus" startTime="417.696" stopTime="542.537">
            <label>Mr. William G. Broaddus</label>
            <text syncTime="417.696" offset="1813587">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="418.165" offset="1815468">Of course, in Virginia there would be many other ways in which the inmate might recover that particular property, through the inmate grievance procedure or through state actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.592" offset="1853189">So he is certainly not without remedies to recover in that situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="433.396" offset="1876386">In order to minimize the problems which are brought about by the introduction of drugs and weapons into prisons official surveillance is and as this Court has noted traditionally always has been the order of the day in prisons.</text>
            <text syncTime="450.956" offset="1946707">If one follows the analysis which this Court has established for Fourth Amendment cases which emanated out of Katz and applied more recently in United States versus Knox and before that in Smith v. Maryland, one can only conclude that a prisoner does not have a legitimate expectation of privacy in prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="473.212" offset="2035733">First, does the prisoner himself actually expect privacy?</text>
            <text syncTime="477.864" offset="2054332">In this particular situation we know from the prisoner's affidavit that he and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="482.739" offset="2073767">"realizes routine shakedowns are necessary to properly run a prison. "</text>
            <text syncTime="487.701" offset="2093620">So he himself had no actual expectation of privacy, but even if he did certainly society is not prepared to legitimize such an expectation because society has recognized the paramount needs of prison administrators to search, to seek out weapons, to seek out drugs and contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.088" offset="2191213">Both society and inmates want prisons to be a safe place, but they can only be safe if weapons and drugs and contraband are kept out.</text>
            <text syncTime="523.495" offset="2236876">So we would contend that because the prisoner does not expect privacy and because society is not prepared and has not in any way legitimized an expectation that he has no basis for claiming privacy entitled to Fourth Amendment protection.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="542.537" stopTime="576.540">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="542.537" offset="2312944">What if in a shakedown which you say is perfectly permissible, a random shakedown, suppose it is and the officer enters his cell and is searching around and he just picks up a radio and carries it out.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.262" offset="2395909">He doesn't destroy it, he just... You say the Fourth Amendment protection of effects just does not apply in a prison?</text>

            <text syncTime="576.540" offset="2448990">We would take the position, Justice White, that it does not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="580.413" offset="2464454">Of course, that is not the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.653" offset="2473440">That was simply an allegation of destruction of property without due process--</text>

            <text syncTime="587.686" offset="2493607">There is no question that there was a seizure, and I guess as the case comes to us we assume that it was destroyed.</text>

            <text syncTime="854.042" offset="3558985">We submit that there is no right of privacy which a prison inmate possesses under the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="862.208" offset="3591690">To suggest that an inmate has an intimate right of privacy in his locker comparable to a woman's fundamental privacy to an abortion or a couple's right of privacy to practice birth control simply is novel at best and to find such in a prison setting is simply untenable.</text>
            <text syncTime="883.111" offset="3675282">The Court of Appeals' approach seemed to be calculated to give a little bit to the prison administrator and something to the prison inmate as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="894.751" offset="3721884">We suggest that that approach not only splits the baby but is simply unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="899.874" offset="3742364">Under the Court of Appeals' approach the prison inmate would not have any greater enhanced freedom from searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.739" offset="3773816">He would still be subject to random searches, but the Court of Appeals' approach would certainly limit the capability of the guard to make a search in a meaningful manner such that it would deter the introduction to prisons of weapons and drugs and other contraband.</text>
            <text syncTime="925.180" offset="3843615">Now the unreasonableness of the Court of Appeals' approach is demonstrated we believe by a 1976 University of Virginia Law Review article by Gianelli and Galligan which was cited with approval by the court below.</text>
            <text syncTime="939.569" offset="3901084">That article suggested that a plan should be promulgated on constitutional grounds before prison guards may search.</text>
            <text syncTime="950.227" offset="3943716">It would require limitations upon the frequency and the intensity of the search.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.881" offset="3974332">It would suggest that if a guard was searching for a knife that he would be able to search only in those places where a knife might be found, and once the knife was found the search would have to cease.</text>
            <text syncTime="971.879" offset="4030338">We submit that such an approach is unreasonable and unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="977.716" offset="4053744">It simply tranforms the Fourth Amendment into a font of tort law without any privacy interest being present to be implicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="989.722" offset="4101705">Such an approach would simply increase federal litigation without substantially advancing the rights of prison inmates.</text>
            <text syncTime="998.888" offset="4138381">As I have indicated we do not suggest that the prisoner is without any protection whatsoever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.844" offset="4170250">We do contend, however, that he may not wrap himself in the Fourth Amendment and use the Fourth Amendment to erect a wall between his activities and necessary security activities undertaken to a properly run prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.995" offset="4230854">We urge this Court to hold that the Fourth Amendment is not applicable in a prison.</text>
            <text syncTime="1029.740" offset="4261783">If the Court rejects this position then we would further urge that it should reject the requirement of the Court of Appeals that random searches can be conducted only pursuant to an established program or policy for such.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.149" offset="4331478">We would urge this Court to adopt an approach which would say that all prison searches for security purposes undertaken in a reasonable manner are per se constitutional under the reasonableness clause of th Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1065.282" offset="4403994">That approach would be comparable to what this Court has utilized in the 1972 case of United States v. Biswolf which is not cited in our brief but one in which the Court upheld warrantless administrative searches in the gun industry even though probable cause and reasonable suspicion were not present and there was no plan for such searches.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.198" offset="4499602">Finally on this point we would also urge the Court to clarify that the normal rules of proof and going forward in civil cases should control a 1983 claim such as this and not the burden shifting approach which the Court of Appeals seemed to adopt in what be more appropriate in criminal suppression motions in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1117.957" offset="4614645">I would like to turn now to a second issue, that of the Parrat v. Taylor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1125.260" offset="4643902">The Petitioner submits that the line of cases beginning with Paul v. Davis and going through Zimmerman Brush do not depend upon the state of mind of the state actor or the state public official charged with the wrongful conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.021" offset="4714956">Indeed Paul v. Davis, Ingraham v. Wright, and McCollan v. Baker, the action was at least arguably intentionally undertaken.</text>
            <text syncTime="1155.951" offset="4766678">The analysis we submit must depend instead upon whether the state was logically able to anticipate the wrongful act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.747" offset="4809832">If the state was not able to anticipate the wrongful act then it was not in a position to provide in a meaningful manner a predeprivation hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1177.776" offset="4853927">In that situation if it does go forward and provide in a meaningful manner a post-deprivation remedy which is capable of making the victim of the tort whole under Parrat v. Taylor, the person has not been deprived of procedural due process and has not lost property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.913" offset="4958521">In this situation we have only an allegation of random conduct which was not sanctioned or condoned by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.261" offset="4999899">It was not pursuant to an official scheme or plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1219.063" offset="5019125">Accordingly the state action is not complete, and because the state action was not complete and the state has provided meaningful remedies there has not been a taking of property without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1234.193" offset="5079625">In the reply brief the Cross Petitioner suggests that the Petitioner seeks to constitutionalize the deprivation of property without our argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.412" offset="5128526">If the state condoned the action here then perhaps it would fall under Zimmerman Brush, but that is not the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.170" offset="5175547">As I have indicated we have only the random isolated single allegation of wrongful conduct depriving someone of property, and due process has been provided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1269.987" offset="5222776">So the deprivation was not without due process of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.329" offset="5236151">In conclusion, we would ask this Court to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals so that the matter may be sent back to the District Court and have that decision upheld dismissing the complaint.</text>

            <text syncTime="1628.352" offset="6656271">Absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.621" offset="6661287">In fact the question presented is simply whether the Fourth Amendment applies within prison, and that is what the Fourth Circuit held.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.926" offset="6694515">The Fourth Circuit did proceed to address such issues as burden of proof and, of course, Petitioner has argued that that has been shifted and shifted incorrectly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.993" offset="6726802">I read the Fourth Circuit's opinion differently, and I read it to be that a prisoner must allege an unreasonable search and seizure which is going to be a very small range of searches or seizures in a prison setting that will be unreasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.702" offset="6789705">Once he has alleged that then the state can justify it if they do honestly justify it by saying that we have a pattern of random searches or I had a particular suspicion about this individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.743" offset="6845816">But to pick on the person, to do it abusively for only the purpose of harassment would be I think a classic case of an unreasonable search and seizure and perhaps one of the only cases of an unreasonable search and seizure within a prison setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.302" offset="6908092">I believe that is why Petitioner is retreated to a bright line request for this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.476" offset="6924706">I certainly suspect that Petitioner is not in a position to request a bright line because Petitioner knew that what Petitioner was doing was wrong, but even if this Court felt that a bright line was needed I can suggest another line that I think is equally bright in a prison setting which is that it is unconstitutional to search and seize for the purpose of harassment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1718.459" offset="7016657">I think that Petitioner's position on the Fourth Amendment is unwarranted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.432" offset="7032539">It is unsound, and I think that for that reason the Court should decline the invitation to sweep away this constitutional right any more broadly than necessary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.959" offset="7074649">Again, the only question that has been framed for this Court is whether the Fourth Amendment applies in prisons, and indeed it should even though that may only provide limited protection to a prisoner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.676" offset="7113519">With regard to the second question in this case, that is, the due process issue and the question of whether a due process violation, whether an intentional abusive deprivation can ever violate the due process clause when it violates a state's own laws which is to say when a state--</text>

            <text syncTime="1777.100" offset="7251236">The Fourth Amendment issue was raised in the original petition by the Attorney General's Office, and I am addressing now the issue I raised which is the due process, whether an intentional, abusive deprivation is totally unprotected by the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1791.678" offset="7309542">I think Petitioner who alleged that it does not has totally missed a major distinction in this case which is a distinction between suits against higher supervisory officials or otherwise against general policies or procedures and challenges directly to individuals who themselves have abused.</text>
            <text syncTime="1812.540" offset="7393029">In the former case understandably the analysis is going to turn on whether a wrongful deprivation was pursuant to that policy or was instead a random act not authorized by the procedure, a fluke, or even an abuse under a procedure where the risk of abuse is low as in Ingraham.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.307" offset="7484040">But that is not this case, and that analysis does not apply to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.158" offset="7499504">This case is a challenge directly to the individual who abused, and in that sense this case is governed by Screws v. United States and Monroe v. Pape.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.415" offset="7536493">Both of those cases involved challenges directly to the officials who abused, not to supervisory officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.370" offset="7564288">In both of those cases the Court said that it is no defense that the act is unauthorized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1862.634" offset="7593336">It is no defense that it is unauthorized even if that means that a state then provides remedies and that, therefore, one might be able to receive compensation in state courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1876.274" offset="7647984">This was rejected in Screws v. United States where the Court cleanly held under a challenge to the individual official that that intentional wrongful deprivation violated the due process clause immediately and state court remedies are completely and totally irrelevant.</text>

            <text syncTime="1950.273" offset="7943899">But this Court has never severed property off from the other rights, and the due process clause, of course, mentions them in the same breath.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.529" offset="7980993">What Screws held was that it did not matter whether there were remedies after the fact, that the deprivation immediately at once violated the due process clause.</text>

            <text syncTime="2295.036" offset="9322956">and it is a negligence, not that he was trying to run him over, that would simply not be a due process violation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2322.825" offset="9434133">In Logan there was a too high risk of error.</text>

            <text syncTime="2327.306" offset="9452105">There were many safeguards in Ingraham which prevented this, but in all of those cases and in fact in most of the cases that have been before this Court in due process situations we have been looking at supervisory officials for their policies and whether they allowed too many things to happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2343.739" offset="9517829">In that context I think negligence can state a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.429" offset="9532562">But if we are looking to the individual himself for his own particular action I do not think due process is implicated unless we are talking about an abuse of power, and I think Screws and Monroe made it very clear that an abuse of power was the very target of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2365.472" offset="9604764">If you follow Petitioner's argument an officer... We must remember that this is not just in prison settings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2373.759" offset="9637888">The due process issue is not confined to the prison setting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.901" offset="9650427">It applies to officers out on the street as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2379.904" offset="9662443">If an officer can walk up to someone and grab his glasses off his face because he does not like him and grind them into the ground, Petitioner's argument would say as long as there is a state tort of conversion the victim of that abuse is confined to state court exactly as if his neighbor had done that.</text>
