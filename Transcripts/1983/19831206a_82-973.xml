            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="13.471" offset="201403">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="16.884" offset="215091">The issue in this case is whether Congress, when it passed the Refugee Act of 1980, intended to change the substantive standard that an alien must meet under Section 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act in order to avoid deportation on the ground that he would be subject to persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.019" offset="303594">Although the Second Circuit stated that the matter was not free from doubt, that court held that Congress in 1980 had intended to make a significant change in the substantive standard under Section 243(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="54.630" offset="366079">We believe that the Court of Appeals interpretation of the statute is plainly inconsistent with Congress' intent, and that it will create harmful problems for the administration of the immigration laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.417" offset="417175">The facts here may be briefly stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="69.710" offset="426370">Respondent Stevic came to this country as a nonimmigrant visitor from Yugoslavia in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.706" offset="462314">Respondent stayed here beyond the time authorized in his visa, and he was therefore ordered deported in December 1976, but Respondent at that time designated Yugoslavia as the country to which he wished to be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.197" offset="532322">Respondent did not leave the United States as a result of this deportation order; instead, in 1977 he moved to reopen his deportation proceedings, to apply for withholding relief under Section 243(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="112.898" offset="599091">Respondent contended that he had recently joined a Serbian anticommunist organization in Chicago and that as a result, he feared he would be subject to persecution on the basis of his political opinions if he were to be returned home to Yugoslavia.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.218" offset="668368">The Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals denied the motion to reopen on the grounds that Respondent's application consisted largely of conclusory assertions, and that Respodent hadn't made a sufficient showing that he was likely to be singled out for persecution if he went home to Yugoslavia.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.984" offset="747467">Respondent did not appeal that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.265" offset="760633">In February 1981 the INS again ordered Respondent to surrender for deportation, and he responded by filing a second motion to reopen his deportation proceedings in order to renew his request for withholding relief under Section 243(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="171.355" offset="832940">The Board of Immigration Appeals denied this request in September 1981 saying that Respondent's second motion to reopen was identical to his first, and that he is still hadn't submitted... he still had submitted evidence only of general conditions in Yugoslavia and hadn't provided any direct evidence that he personally would be subject to persecution if he were sent home.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.672" offset="930220">I should add that at no time during the proceedings on the second motion to reopen before the Board of Immigration Appeals, which took place in 1981, did Respondent claim that the Refugee Act of 1980 had changed the substantive standard for judging 243(h) claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.746" offset="1014543">Now, Respondent sought review of the BIA's denial of the second motion to reopen, and as I said a moment ago, the Court of Appeals held that Congress in 1980, when it passed the Refugee Act, had intended to substantially liberalize the standard that an alien must satisfy under Section 243(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="237.490" offset="1097508">The Court of Appeals declined to announce what in its view was the proper standard, but it did state that deportation must now be withheld upon a showing far short of the showing that had to be made prior to 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.488" offset="1161455">The Court of Appeals then remanded Respondent's case to the Board of Immigration Appeals for further proceedings under this new but undefined legal standard that the Second Circuit had announced.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.598" offset="1213909">Now, I think it would be useful to begin by briefly summarizing the government's position because it is really quite a straightforward one and by going back and discussing at somewhat greater length some of the key points.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.668" offset="1274200">For at least the last 20 years, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the Board of Immigration Appeals and reviewing courts have applied a consistent legal standard in judging applications for withholding relief under Section 243(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="299.229" offset="1344417">An applicant under Section 243(h) has had to make a subjective showing and an objective showing.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.936" offset="1375242">The test has required an applicant to show both that he fears persecution or feared persecution in the country to which he would be deported on the basis of one of the statutorily enumerated grounds... that is the subjective showing... and that his fear was supported by objective evidence demonstrating a realistic likelihood that he would be singled out for persecution if he were deported.</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="335.103" offset="1487986">Well, the terms "clear probability" and "realistic likelihood" have been used interchangeably by the Board of Immigration Appeals and the Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="348.190" offset="1540335">Yes, and I think the Board and the courts have used the words interchangeably over the years, which shows that there is no substantive difference in these catchword phrases.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.986" offset="1575444">They don't describe the legal standard; they merely refer to it.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="380.083" offset="1667918">You're saying that the objective test is the one which the Board has said was the minimum.</text>

            <text syncTime="385.196" offset="1688293">In other words, over the last 20 years, an alien has had to show consistently in order to get relief from the Board or the courts that there is some reason to believe he would be treated differently from the mass of his fellow citizens in his home country if he were deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.035" offset="1751718">Now, prior to 1968 the Board generally referred to this as reasonable likelihood of persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.370" offset="1777005">As Justice White mentioned, on occasion some courts called it a clear probability of persecution or a reasonable likelihood.</text>

            <text syncTime="415.026" offset="1807620">Well, the courts... that was a phrase that actually, first of all, was in a court case.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.958" offset="1819323">The Board had referred to it as a reasonable likelihood of persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="421.938" offset="1835310">The point is that we can't get too caught up, as I think the Second Circuit was, with these catchword phrases.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.204" offset="1856313">We have to look at the test that the Board was in fact applying over these years because however the standard was denominated, it seems quite clear that the standard I just described was the standard that the Board and the Courts had been following consistently prior to 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.915" offset="1927157">We don't take anybody to be disputing that.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.136" offset="1940113">We don't take Respondent or the Second Circuit to be disputing that it was an appropriate legal standard prior to 1968 under Section 243(h).</text>

            <text syncTime="521.626" offset="2234043">Now, there were, as I said, two statutory changes since 1968 that relate to refugees.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.018" offset="2255568">One was the United States' accession in 1968 to the United Nations protocol related to refugees, and the other was the passage in 1980 of the Refugee Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.136" offset="2304051">It is the government's position that neither of the statutory changes was intended in any way to alter the substantive standard applied to Section 243(h) relief, so that if the standard was correct, as we take everyone to agree it was prior to 1968, it is still the correct standard today because each time Congress has revisited this area of the law, although it has changed some of the terminology, it has gone on record as saying it didn't intend to make any substantive change in the standard that the Board and the court should apply in judging claims for withholding relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.528" offset="2449606">Now, we reached this conclusion by the following route.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.331" offset="2464861">First, when the Senate acceded to the United Nations protocol in 1968, it did so on the express understanding that it would not alter or enlarge the substance of our immigration laws relating to withholding of deportation in any way.</text>
            <text syncTime="596.923" offset="2535183">This is what the Senate was told by the President of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="600.156" offset="2548140">This is what the Senate was told by the Secretary of State and what it was told by a representative of the State Department who was the only witness to testify before the Senate on the hearings that were held on the protocol.</text>

            <text syncTime="616.957" offset="2615327">Mr. Geller, the convention from 1951 requires that the alien have a well-founded fear, that is, be a refugee, and also that the alien's life or freedom would be threatened.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.707" offset="2686380">Do those two phrases mean the same thing?</text>

            <text syncTime="637.599" offset="2697978">I think that the well-found... the life or freedom would be threatened is simply a synonym for what we had called up until that point persecution, and the well-founded fear goes to the substantive standard that an alien must meet in order to show that he would be persecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.652" offset="2770180">We don't think that Congress intended either change when it adhered to the protocol, even though the protocol had that different language, and in fact, the different language, as I will come to, was worked into the Immigration and Nationality Act in 1980 with Congress again saying we don't intend to make any substantive change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.424" offset="2845204">Now, as I was saying, the Senate was explicitly told this by everyone who testified on the protocol in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.979" offset="2879477">We have quoted some of that testimony at page 26 of our brief, that Laurence Dawson, who was a representative of the State Department, said, and I quote,</text>

            <text syncTime="703.024" offset="2959620">Mr. Dawson also said</text>

            <text syncTime="766.805" offset="3214784">All of the representations made to the Senate in 1968 indicated that our immigration laws already included the human provisions of the protocol, and perhaps the best evidence of this, the fact that Congress thought it was simply making a symbolic gesture when it adhered to the protocol, was that there was absolutely no opposition to the protocol.</text>
            <text syncTime="788.888" offset="3303078">There were virtually no hearings on the protocol, and it passed the Senate unanimously.</text>

            <text syncTime="815.747" offset="3410494">And in fact, this understanding was completely borne out, if there could have been any doubt in 1968 itself, this understanding that the phrase was exactly the same was borne out by the administrative practice over the next 12 years because no court, after accession to the protocol in 1968, held that the substantive standard had in any way been changed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1134.134" offset="4684120">It was raised, really, in the first time in Mr. Stevic's reply brief in the Second Circuit, and therefore, the Second Circuit delved into this fairly complicated area of the law without any help from briefing from the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1147.163" offset="4736156">The one case that they relied on, the matter of Tan, to justify their assertion that 203(a)(7) relief wa different than 243(h) relief, we think for the reasons we have stated in our brief is clearly erroneous and distinguishable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.923" offset="4803238">That was the only Board case that they relied on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1165.936" offset="4811284">So in any event, in 1968 we acceded to the protocol on the express understanding that there was no change in our substantive law, and in 1980 we incorporated the language of the protocol into the statute for the first time, again only for the purposes of clarity so... not to... once again not to make any substantive change in the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1187.259" offset="4896548">So if the protocol did not change the law in 1968, it is hard to see how Congress, by using the same phrases, putting it into the law in 1980 for the purposes of clarity, as they said, could be taken to have changed the substantive standard.</text>

            <text syncTime="1802.046" offset="7355715">So we think that the standard that was applicable prior to 1968 meets the well-founded fear language of the protocol.</text>

            <text syncTime="1863.406" offset="7601162">The government would have us believe that this is a matter simply of clarification of language and that it simply is a matter of cosmetic changes having been made to our laws which cosmetic changes don't have any meaning at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1881.777" offset="7674618">It's the government's contention that the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980 made no change in the standard an alien must meet in order to have deportation withheld on the ground that he would be subject to persecution in his own country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1897.036" offset="7735640">It is also the government's contention that the standard prior to the Act's passage, which was clear probability of persecution, and the standard subsequent to the passage of the Refugee Act, which was well-founded fear of persecution, are really one and the same, and by mixing up the language and using the different terms indiscriminately, that we might be able to come to that conclusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1925.035" offset="7847653">What did the congressional committees have to say about the change when they made it?</text>

            <label>Ms. Ann L. Ritter</label>
            <text syncTime="1929.900" offset="7867088">--The congressional committee at the time that Section 243(h) was amended, the congressional committee reported that the changes in the Refugee Act had to be construed consistent with the United Nations protocol relating to the status of refugees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1951.884" offset="7955069">Now, the United Nations protocol makes it very clear what their standard was, which was well-founded fear of persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1959.968" offset="7987460">Also, this was referred to just a few minutes ago, but only in part.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.914" offset="8023196">It would say that the substantive standard is not changed was what had been reported to Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.821" offset="8062798">In addition to that... this is on page 39 if the government's brief... there is a statement,</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.024" offset="8091637">"asylum will continue to be granted only to those who qualify under the terms of the United Nations Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, to which the United States acceded in November 1969. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1999.735" offset="8146494">In other words, when the Refugee Act of 1980 was passed, it was the intent, it was the clear intent of Congress that we should follow our obligations under the United Nations Protocol, and that we should recognize a new standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.815" offset="8214830">Now, one of the problems is that I don't believe that it was recognized by the Congress that the old standard had made such a mess of itself, and that is one of the major problems here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.485" offset="8273449">The old standard had been... had grown up through Section 243(h).</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.140" offset="8304064">Originally, Section 243(h) gave to the Attorney General the power to withhold deportation in his discretion if it was found that the alien would be subject to persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2056.012" offset="8371565">This discretion to withhold deportation was assumed to me by the Attorney General that they could determine the standard and, since there was no other... since there was at that time no law giving them any other criteria, that they could just determine the standard by which an alien would not be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.336" offset="8468845">The discretion of the Attorney General as enunciated in the very early cases was that there should be a clear probability of persecution and that an alien had to be singled out for persecution in order to avoid deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.678" offset="8542301">Now, no matter how you look at it, this language is not the same language that is now used.</text>
            <text syncTime="2105.353" offset="8568946">Why it has continued to be upheld by the government, I really don't know.</text>
            <text syncTime="2112.837" offset="8598935">I tried to point out in my brief some possibility, and that possibility I felt was that we had a peculiar situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.904" offset="8639163">We had adhered to the United Nations protocol in 1969.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.707" offset="8658389">Under the protocol we had the... there was a standard set forth for refugees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.353" offset="8688900">That was a person who would be... whose life or freedom would be threatened if he were to be returned to his own country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.257" offset="8716590">There was a... it was clearly based upon a well-founded fear of persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.003" offset="8747519">After we adhered to the protocol, very little was done by the government or by the administrative agencies to recognize their obligations under the protocol, practically nothing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.311" offset="8796734">This was in 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.492" offset="8805511">The Refugee Act was not passed until 1979, I believe, and went into force in 1980.</text>

            <text syncTime="2181.603" offset="8873952">The matter came up in a case called In the Matter of Dunar.</text>

            <label>Ms. Ann L. Ritter</label>
            <text syncTime="2191.480" offset="8913449">--Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.921" offset="8915225">At that time the INS recognized that there was a protocol, and they also recognized that we had a standard which was clear probability of persecution, and it tried to reconcile the two, and in order to reconcile the two, it stated that the protocol was a self-executing treaty, and that therefore it was part of our domestic law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.296" offset="9016685">If this was a self-executing treaty and it was part of our domestic law to justify why we were not following our domestic law, it stated that what we... and this is very similar to the argument now... it stated that what we were following was equivalent with almost the same, the same kind of argument that you are hearing today, almost the same, and afterwards I will try to point out why this almost the same kind of thing is very dangerous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2244.704" offset="9126399">They said that the... that this was almost the same, and therefore, there was absolutely no conflict for their obligations under the protocol, and that well-founded fear and clear... which was under the protocol's standard, and clear probability, were in fact the same kind of thing, and therefore, an alien who had asserted rights under the protocol could be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.942" offset="9239353">Now, very... this was all based upon the fact of our considering the protocol a self-executing treaty, and a lot of terrible decisions have arisen out of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2289.264" offset="9304554">Curiously, very recently in the Federal Register, in order to support the position that the government is now taking regarding detention of aliens, the Immigration Service in the Federal Register is stating that the protocol was a non-self-executing treaty, which of course would have wiped out Matter of Dunar, and that the Immigration Service therefore has the power to follow only those provisions of the protocol which have been enacted into law in the Refugee Act of 1980.</text>
            <text syncTime="2327.809" offset="9458781">Now, I am not discussing that whole thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.009" offset="9471529">The government takes whichever side it feels that it should take and then tries to say that, well, if we call this well-founded fear and it is really clear probability, then they are all really the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="2341.587" offset="9513847">Now, I would like to, before I go any further, make some statements about the facts of this case because I think that the difference between clear probability and well-founded fear can be highlighted by the facts, by the very facts in the Stevic case and the government has left out some of the facts which I think would throw some light on what the difference is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.401" offset="9657103">Mr. Stevic, as was stated, came to the United States in 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.394" offset="9677165">He applied for I think an extension.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.506" offset="9689599">In any case, he came before an immigration judge who gave him the ability to leave the country voluntarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.642" offset="9718125">He was not ordered deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.863" offset="9727007">Shortly thereafter he married an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.326" offset="9740799">Now, the background of this lady has a bearing on this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.420" offset="9765250">Her father was a national of Yugoslavia originally who had fled Yugoslavia, had gone to Belgium where she was born.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.294" offset="9796701">She was a United States citizen; her father was a United States citizen, but they were Yugoslavian by origin and by ethnic affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.349" offset="9832959">At the time that Mr. Stevic married Mirjana Doichin, her father, who was a United States citizen, had returned to Yugoslavia and had been imprisoned, even as a United States citizen, in Yugoslavia for three years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2437.469" offset="9897429">He returned I believe around 1977 or '78 and committed suicide.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.714" offset="9922402">At that time, after he married Mirjana, before he ever had any need to assert the fact that the was a refugee, he became involved in the efforts of the... in the activities of the Yugoslavian community in Chicago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.476" offset="9997426">He joined the Ravnagora, which is an organization which is trying to rid Yugoslavia of Communism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.487" offset="10057508">He joined other Serbian organizations in the United States, outside of his own country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2487.481" offset="10097423">He became quite active.</text>
            <text syncTime="2488.923" offset="10103274">Now, this was partially because he was a part of this family, and this was partially because of his own conviction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2496.558" offset="10133785">Mr. Stevic was a philosophy graduate in Yugoslavia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2500.832" offset="10150817">He was not a simple man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2503.594" offset="10161893">He was a complicated man.</text>
            <text syncTime="2505.453" offset="10169312">Perhaps he might have done these things in Yugoslavia, but it would have been very dangerous for him to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.587" offset="10193867">But certainly at this time, when he did this, he had no reason to believe that he would have been deported because he was married to an American citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.476" offset="10237439">He was going to becoming a resident and eventually a U.S. citizen if, you know, by the normal operation of our laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.490" offset="10269518">He had no reason to believe that he would have any repercussion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2535.163" offset="10288221">He had only a reason to believe that in our country he could join these organizations, he could speak out, he could be the kind of person that he would have liked to have been, perhaps, in Yugoslavia, and not be persecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2549.642" offset="10346109">Now, in Yugoslavia there is a very interesting law which we don't have here, so it seems bizarre.</text>
            <text syncTime="2557.329" offset="10376829">It is called hostile propaganda.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.760" offset="10386546">It is part of the Yugoslavian constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.821" offset="10394801">Under the Yugoslavian constitution, if I or you or any of us, if we are a Yugoslavian citizen, speaks out against the government in any way whatsoever... this doesn't mean that I have to write an article in the newspaper or give a speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.031" offset="10455614">I can talk to you as a friend, I can meet with people at private social gatherings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2583.716" offset="10482363">Certainly if I joined an emigre organization avowedly against the government, that is more than is required, but if I do that, under Yugoslavia's hostile propaganda laws, I will be imprisoned if I return to Yugoslavia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2600.947" offset="10551327">I don't have to do this in Yugoslavia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2602.867" offset="10559059">I can do this outside of the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.699" offset="10570344">I can do this as an emigre.</text>
            <text syncTime="2607.882" offset="10579016">This is what poor Mirja's father did.</text>
            <text syncTime="2610.062" offset="10587793">He though that he was protected by his U.S. citizenship, which he wasn't, because they considered him still a national of Yugoslavia.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.537" offset="10613707">But I don't have to be in Yugoslavia.</text>

            <text syncTime="2623.320" offset="10640770">Now, even now... and this is not in the briefs, but I just noticed this in the newspaper about two weeks ago, and I think it is sort of interesting... there was a Yugoslavian journalist who at private parties talked about the government, and she has now been put in jail for about a year, even now.</text>

            <text syncTime="2774.432" offset="11245243">That is where the problem is because they would meet the well-founded fear test.</text>
            <text syncTime="2779.715" offset="11266350">For clear probability, I must show objective evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2785.538" offset="11289651">I have had this problem with other refugees from countries who left with the clothes on their backs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.205" offset="11320371">What can they show, a little execution list?</text>

            <text syncTime="2797.617" offset="11338030">What can they show, a... there is very little that they can show.</text>
            <text syncTime="2802.860" offset="11358928">It is my assertion that a special inquiry officer, a judge, should be able to, using the well-founded fear standard which we adopted by the adoption of the Refugee Act of 1980, should be able to take the subjective situation of an alien, determine whether or not that subjective situation is supported by some objective evidence but not the kind of objective evidence that the government requires now because under the clear probability test, they require what most people cannot produce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2852.051" offset="11555787">A determination can be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="2854.843" offset="11566863">As a matter of fact, this determination is now required to be made overseas.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.398" offset="11593090">The government alluded to a report that had been issued by the Immigration Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="2867.491" offset="11617540">This was in August of this year.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.163" offset="11628198">It was issued to posts overseas, Immigration Posts overseas to use in determining who would be qualified for refugee status so that we... so that the officers who would be interviewing would have some guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2888.957" offset="11703327">There is guidance available, and in the government report it is stated individuals may be determined to be refugees if they have a well-founded fear of persecution based upon one of the five bases named in the Act, race, religious, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.756" offset="11822549">The government apply... uses the well-founded fear of persecution test which rather than say, well, we don't know what that means, fellows, you will have to decide, it has spent about 50 pages of a report defining what well-founded fear of persecution is.</text>
            <text syncTime="2940.489" offset="11909485">There is guidance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2941.911" offset="11915232">Now, the definition follows the United Nations handbook that was referred to in many of the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2954.389" offset="11965073">In one part it states that refugee status may be based upon persecution suffered in the past or upon a likely... the likelihood of future persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.106" offset="12067996">Now, it also states that the present of both conditions is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.521" offset="12093596">Now, under the singled out for persecution test, it would be necessary to show my background, back where I came from, the fact that I had been persecuted, the possibility of future persecution which would have to be inferred by a person with some understanding of the background who uses the government reports and some understanding of the... but an intelligent person I think using the guidelines that have been issued by the Immigration Service itself could make a determination of what well-founded fear of persecution would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.011" offset="12267571">In the clear probability test, a person who has nothing but his clothes and who simply says I come from Indonesia, I am a Chinese national, they are burning our stores, they are wiping us out, we are not allowed to work, they are terrorizing our children, assuming that there is a country report that shows that... and by the way, over here there is one, or it states that there is one... assuming that is correct, his own statement under the clear probability test would not have been regarded as enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.682" offset="12454295">Under the new regulations which the government has adopted, it says a statement by the applicant must not be disregarded solely because it is self-serving and that it supports his own claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="3088.740" offset="12502464">Testimony by the applicant is frequently all that is available, and if that testimony is credible, it is sufficient to establish a claim to refugee status.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.737" offset="12550530">An overall assessment of credibility should be made by the adjudicator, and then it goes on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3107.990" offset="12579473">Now, we are not talking about an impossibility in applying the new standard which forces us to stick with the old standard because we sort of knew what that was and therefore we sort of know what this is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3123.211" offset="12640391">There are guidelines.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.443" offset="12645302">It is possible to follow a new standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="3127.084" offset="12655855">Now, the issue in this case hinges upon whether or not there has been a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3137.369" offset="12697024">There has been a change.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.382" offset="12709041">By the government's own admission, we did not regard the protocol as binding, but we do regard the Refugee Act as binding.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.189" offset="12748329">Maybe we should have regarded... I spoke at some length about the concept of whether or not it was a self-executing treaty, but the point is that whether or not it wasn't, if we take some cognizance of how the Immigration Service has regarded it, they have regarded it as a non-self-executing treaty right now as of last year, and that they regard the law which put into domestic effect what the protocol tried to have us follow in terms of our regard for refugees, that certainly is a law, and we can say that these are just cosmetic changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3196.889" offset="12935052">These are not cosmetic changes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.230" offset="12944456">These are changes which will... which have meaning behind them, which have... which it is possible to judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="3210.009" offset="12987611">I believe that some attention has been paid to the Second Circuit's statement that they did not want to go into what well-founded fear of persecution meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3223.126" offset="13040064">That might be that if we are bringing into our domestic legislation the standards that we had promised to bring into our domestic legislation by adhering to the United Nations protocol, then there is voluminous information and guidelines specific guidelines, handbooks of the government, handbooks of the United Nations, that tell us what clear probability of persecution means without the Second Circuit having to write an 80 page decision telling us.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.332" offset="13196904">I don't think that that was necessary, but for the government to say that because they said that they wouldn't go into that now, that it was... you know, that that is a matter that is still left in the large haze is certainly not true.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3279.843" stopTime="3298.886">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3279.843" offset="13266912">Ms. Ritter, if the Court should conclude that the two standards are one and the same, is that the end of your case?</text>

          <turn speaker="ann_l_ritter" startTime="3298.886" stopTime="3591.666">
            <label>Ms. Ann L. Ritter</label>
            <text syncTime="3298.886" offset="13343085">If you conclude that the two standards are one and the same, it would appear that would be the end of my case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3310.224" offset="13388433">But it would also mean that we would be giving no recognition whatsoever to the language that we have tried so hard to put into our domestic law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.688" offset="13470249">Now, speaking about that, the government stated that our accession to the protocol was passed with practically no discussion in the Senate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.501" offset="13501491">I don't know whether anybody here is aware of it, but the well-founded fear standard in the United Nations convention was developed partially by the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3352.971" offset="13559379">Although we did not become signatories to the convention, we were one of the prime instruments in writing that convention.</text>
            <text syncTime="3362.507" offset="13597518">This terminology is something that the United States gave to the United Nations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3369.172" offset="13624267">Also, in the passage of the 1968 protocol, the language of... if you read the Senate reports, which I have, the language was modified several times.</text>
            <text syncTime="3387.514" offset="13697619">As a matter of fact, the language in the United States law is broader, broader, gives more rights to refugees than the language in the United Nations protocol.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.122" offset="13744012">So it can't be that we didn't know what we were doing, that we just sort of said let's do something to adhere to our obligations, let's look like good guys in front of the rest of the world.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.462" offset="13801377">We didn't have to do that because we do, we do look good, and we have done a lot of very good things for refugees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.865" offset="13830948">We are talking about one specific area where we are not doing good things and where we should have.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.891" offset="13859055">Now, I will just summarize at this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.620" offset="13926033">I just have a few more minutes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3446.583" offset="13933870">It is my contention that with the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980, the Congress intended to change the standard used for withholding of deportation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.093" offset="13999908">Because of that, it amended Section 243(h) and it incorporated for the first time in any of our legislation a definition of refugee which is taken directly from the United Nations protocol definition which we had helped to develop.</text>
            <text syncTime="3483.386" offset="14081096">This is clearly an intention to change our law.</text>
            <text syncTime="3487.440" offset="14097292">We had never had any definition of refugee prior to the Refugee Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3492.503" offset="14117563">With this change, we had certain obligations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3501.218" offset="14152463">We had to change our administrative regulations so that the Board of Immigration Appeals would recognize what the changes were.</text>
            <text syncTime="3509.984" offset="14187467">Unfortunately, that did not happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3512.675" offset="14198229">It has happened recently.</text>
            <text syncTime="3514.197" offset="14204290">It didn't happen immediately.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.938" offset="14211291">Now, because it didn't happen immediately, I see no reason to say that because it didn't happen it shouldn't happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="3524.584" offset="14245877">As a matter of fact, it is happening now.</text>
            <text syncTime="3526.945" offset="14255281">As a matter of fact, the standard that is now being used for determining who should be allowed into the country and who should not be... should not be deported is based upon the United Nations standard of well-founded fear of persecution which is now the United States standard, which is well-founded fear of persecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3550.599" offset="14349949">We knew what we were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3552.592" offset="14357890">It is time for the government to be told what it is the standard is, to be told that it can't say one thing and do something else... that is what the problem is... by saying two things are the same.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.222" offset="14416404">They will do what they have continued to do previously and deny withholding to people who should get withholding based upon what the intention of our domestic law was.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.098" offset="14467918">We stated that we intended to conform our domestic law with our obligations under the protocol.</text>
            <text syncTime="3588.336" offset="14500832">I would assume that we meant that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3590.066" offset="14507833">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="3603.396" offset="14561122">If this court holds, as we think it must, on the basis of the 1980 legislative history that Congress didn't mean to change the standard in 1980, it is not the end of the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3613.833" offset="14602918">The case will go back to the Second Circuit which will then have to decide whether Mr. Stevic is entitled to withholding of deportation under the standard that has been consistently applied for 20 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="3622.767" offset="14638654">Perhaps he will be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3624.297" offset="14644714">Ms. Ritter has mentioned some of the compelling circumstances, but if Mr. Stevic is entitled to withholding of deportation, it will be because he is able to meet the showing as thousands and thousands of other aliens have been able to over the last 20 years and not because Congress at any time intended to change the standard, all of the evidences to the contrary.</text>
