            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="143651">We'll hear arguments next in Berkemer against McCarty.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.262" offset="184611">Mr. Travis, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_c_travis" startTime="63.771" stopTime="352.311">
            <label>Mr. Alan C. Travis</label>
            <text syncTime="63.771" offset="398711">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="65.037" offset="403726">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I would like to restate the question presented before the Court in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.596" offset="445940">I believe it can be restated in two parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.531" offset="457747">First of all, the first part of the question should be, in my judgment, whether routine highway traffic safety stops involve the type of custodial interrogation which was a concern of the Miranda court; that is, the routine, everyday, highway traffic stops.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.524" offset="533711">Second... the second portion of our argument... involves a question of whether there can be a reasoned application of the judicially crafted prophylactic rule of Miranda in the case of the impaired driver, a person charged with the offense of driving while impaired by alcohol or other chemical substances.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.719" offset="618453">The salient facts, if I may recapitulate them briefly, indicate that the respondent in this case was observed driving on an interstate highway by a state Highway Patrol trooper on routine traffic safety patrol.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.901" offset="687207">He observed Mr. McCarty's car weaving back and forth within his expected lane of travel, and followed him for some two miles.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.037" offset="719703">After following him for two miles, he caused the car to be stopped, and asked Mr. McCarty to exit the vehicle.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.158" offset="756275">The trooper described Mr. McCarty as falling.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.439" offset="769336">He was unable to stand unaided, and in his later report indicated that he had to be "held up from falling".</text>
            <text syncTime="164.764" offset="802668">He attempted... I'm sorry... at that point... and, by the way, each of these facts were entered before the Municipal Court by way of stipulation between the parties, rather than an evidentiary hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.023" offset="859720">At the point that he realized the man could not stand on his own two feet unaided, Trooper Williams concluded that he would charge Mr. McCarty with a traffic offense, and the parties stipulated at that point his freedom to leave the scene was terminated.</text>
            <text syncTime="196.578" offset="929937">Trooper Williams then attempted to have Mr. McCarty perform certain field sobriety tests I think the Court will recognize are traditional tests of balancing, touching one's nose, walking a straight line, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.183" offset="992317">But, as the alcohol influence report form shows... and that's in the Appendix at page 2 of the Joint Appendix, that is... Mr. McCarty was falling, and therefore the tests could not be completed.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.832" offset="1046965">The trooper noted that Mr. McCarty spoke with very slurred speech... he was very hard to understand... and at this point, asked Mr. McCarty if he had been drinking.</text>
            <text syncTime="238.515" offset="1097643">Mr. McCarty said he had had two beers and had smoked</text>
            <text syncTime="242.717" offset="1114466">"several joints of marijuana a short time before. "</text>
            <text syncTime="246.339" offset="1128990">At that point, the trooper formally arrested Mr. McCarty, and under a state implied consent chemical test statute, transported him to a facility, which in this case was the Franklin County Ohio Jail for a chemical test of his blood alcohol content.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.926" offset="1195341">At that point, Mr. McCarty took the test and the intoxilyzer... that the Court has heard quite a bit about in the last case... the intoxilyzer indicated a zero blood alcohol content.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.170" offset="1260229">At that point, Mr. McCarty presumably still not being able to function, was not released from the Franklin County Jail facility, and the officer began to fill out what is known as the Alcohol Influence Report Form.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.977" offset="1315504">Again, that is in the Joint Appendix, both in its original state and, at the suggestion of the Clerk, in a typewritten facsimile for ease of reading.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.676" offset="1354270">The trooper filled out the report form which is a pro forma line item, fill-in-the-blanks form, if you will.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.703" offset="1394394">It is a statement on the front page, as the Court will note, which recounts the date and time of the offense, the trooper's observations of the driving offense that he had witnessed the man traveling for two miles and so forth, could not stand on his feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.776" offset="1454684">It recounted his statements at the scene of the traffic offense... excuse me... to the effect that he had two beers and smoked several marijuana cigarettes.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.959" offset="1495435">And then on the back of the form, as the Court will note, the trooper inquired of Mr. McCarty as to whether he knew what day it was, what date it was, what time it was, and the various responses are down there.</text>

            <text syncTime="976.179" offset="4048330">And I would stress the term "impaired driving".</text>

            <text syncTime="985.801" offset="4086782">In this instance, we suggest that there are unique reasons why the prophylactic rule was not applicable in this case, in this type of case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1023.145" offset="4236203">One of the first things any conscientious detective will do is make a determination, factually, of the ability, the cognitive ability of this individual whom he wishes to question, the cognitive ability to be aware of his so-called Miranda advice, Miranda warnings, to have the cognitive ability to appreciate them, to fully understand them, and then, of course, under Johnson against Zerbst, for the later court hearing, whether there would be a knowing, intelligent, voluntary waiver of those rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="1062.862" offset="4395027">The difficulty with the impaired driver and the uniqueness of this offense is that the very preliminary questions that any conscientious detective would ask are precluded if Miranda is applicable, The conscientious detective would inquire of the individual's age, educational background, their ability to read and write, and almost universally, I submit, whether the person had been drinking, whether the person had taken any drugs; if they've been drinking, when, how much, and so forth.</text>

            <text syncTime="2985.221" offset="12084431">Judge Wellford in his dissenting opinion and the court below indicated that he would not overturn the lower court ruling because he felt that the statements made at the scene were redundant with the statements made later at the station house.</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.511" offset="12149633">We would submit that that is not the case; that when Mr. McCarty was questioned at the station house, he admitted the primary aspect of this entire case, the fundamental issue, that being that he was under the influence of alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.255" offset="12212640">That admission was not made at the scene.</text>
            <text syncTime="3019.115" offset="12220059">Moreover, at the station house it was clear that Mr. McCarty indicated to the officer that he had a limp, he had a bad back, which can explain, quite obviously, the problems he had walking.</text>
            <text syncTime="3033.576" offset="12277947">In addition to that, he had only slept for an hour the night before.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.043" offset="12291739">All of those factors weigh against the harmless error aspect that is pursued by the petitioner in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3045.072" offset="12323922">As far as we are concerned, Your Honor, the failure to raise that issue in the court below should preclude it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3051.023" offset="12347641">Nevertheless, if that issue is reached, it's pretty much without question that there was not harmless error in this case; that ample defense was available to Mr. McCarty and would certainly have been much more defensible had his inadmissible statements been kept out of the record, as the Sixth Circuit ruled they should have been.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.546" offset="12421829">Unless the Court has any further questions, that concludes argument.</text>

            <label>Mr. Alan C. Travis</label>
            <text syncTime="3077.106" offset="12452027">Only very briefly, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.621" offset="12462058">On the Sixth Circuit panel opinion, I would simply invite the Court's attention to the fact that the Court did order, that is, the Sixth Circuit did order the writ and a retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3091.100" offset="12508033">And I would submit to the Court that on retrial, without some clarification here, we would not know what to tell the state trial court was admissible or not admissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.847" offset="12547008">As to the felony-misdemeanor line, I think the Court will note that we have never pressed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3106.281" offset="12568742">We have never pressed that in any of the... in the petition or the brief, other than the general question of whether or not the Miranda doctrine should be applied in the case of misdemeanor traffic offenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3119.806" offset="12622867">We've never suggested that it's simply not applicable because it is, in fact, a misdemeanor.</text>
            <text syncTime="3125.181" offset="12644288">And, last, although we, of course, differ on it, we would urge that if the Court does disagree with the second portion of our argument, that it was effectively ruled upon by the Sixth Circuit and that the doctrine of harmless error should be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.328" offset="12716908">Mr. McCarty's condition prior to the so-called Alcohol Influence Report Form as such, and if his handwriting is impaired, which is nontestimonial, I would submit would make any error in this case harmless beyond any reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="3159.119" offset="12780124">Thank you very much.</text>
