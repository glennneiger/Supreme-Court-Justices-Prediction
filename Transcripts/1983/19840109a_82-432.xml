            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="147474">Mr. Witlen, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary S. Witlen</label>
            <text syncTime="108.097" offset="579853">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="108.409" offset="581107">Today we ask the Court to determine whether union elections of officer are to be run under the supervision of the federal judiciary or the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.092" offset="623738">The key question is whether a court can order a union to conduct a new election of officers under Title I of the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act in response to a suit filed by someone other than the Secretary of Labor.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.072" offset="687686">It is our position that Congress vested the Secretary and only the Secretary with authority to bring suit to rerun an election of union officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.472" offset="729273">Congress repeatedly rejected other enforcement schemes including suit by individual union members both before and after the addition of Title I to the legislation, and all of the bills considered over the course of two sessions of Congress relied upon the Secretary of Labor as the agent of government to supervise the rerun of union election of officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.619" offset="825926">Thus, we seek reversal of the lower courts and reaffirmation of this Court's prior decisions that Title IV, not Title I, is to be utilized to resolve challenges to elections of union officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.441" offset="885172">We ask that the ballots cast by the members of Local 82 in the 1980 election be returned to the union for tabulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.203" offset="916205">I would like to highlight several of the facts set forth more fully in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.576" offset="941701">First, suit here was filed based upon alleged violations of Titles I and IV of the Act which occurred at the union's nomination meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.071" offset="987676">The suit was not filed until after the union had mailed the mailed balloting packets to its members for voting in the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.084" offset="1023725">A temporary restraining order was subsequently issued without an evidentiary hearing some 17 hours before the ballots were to be picked up and tabulated for the stated purpose of preserving the Court's jurisdiction and in order to prevent the Plaintiffs, the Respondents in this case, from having to go through the electoral processes of challenging an election under Title IV.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.401" offset="1133022">As a result the union was unable to elect officers for an additional year after the temporary restraining order was issued.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.647" offset="1170011">In the interim the union was run by officers who had been elected four years previously.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.817" offset="1194671">The new election ordered by the Court was conducted under its rules and under its court appointed arbitrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="271.343" offset="1232810">Presently pending before the District Court these many years later is the application for attorneys' fees on behalf of Respondents, is a request for permanent relief, is the union's expected expense for reimbursement for the costs of the election that was conducted under the court's order, and for Petitioner Harris' claims for wages if it should be found that he was the successful candidate in the 1980 election.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="303.253" offset="1360392">Who ends up paying for the arbitrator or whoever it is the court appoints?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gary_s_witlen" startTime="308.109" stopTime="321.198">
            <label>Mr. Gary S. Witlen</label>
            <text syncTime="308.109" offset="1379827">The union paid for the entire cost of the election including the arbitrator with the understanding, which was discussed at the time, that the union could seek reimbursement from the Plaintiffs if the District Court's injunction was ultimately overturned.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="321.198" offset="1432176">Would there have been that sort of expense to either party if the Secretary had brought the injunction?</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary S. Witlen</label>
            <text syncTime="326.275" offset="1452552">Certainly some of the expenses of conducting an election would have been incurred, but the major expense, that in excess of $7,000 to pay the arbitrator's expenses would not have been incurred because the Secretary of Labor does not charge the union for its expenses and personnel in conducting the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.627" offset="1525903">That is the greatest bulk of the expense.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="346.813" offset="1534681">Were the procedures for the election under the court order like the procedures that the Secretary would follow under IV?</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary S. Witlen</label>
            <text syncTime="358.511" offset="1581492">There were major discrepancies between what the Secretary would do and what the union would do and what the court ordered.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="365.994" stopTime="367.742">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Gary S. Witlen</label>
            <text syncTime="367.742" offset="1618377">Primarily the arbitrators that were appointed did not have the expertise of the Secretary to make evaluations as to the application of the Secretary's own administrative regulations or the union's constitutional regulations and requirements.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary S. Witlen</label>
            <text syncTime="401.119" offset="1751915">We would not be making the same argument if the suit was brought prior to the time the ballots were mailed out.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="409.210" offset="1784307">Would not some of your policy arguments be equally strong about having the wrong people running the election and so forth?</text>

          <turn speaker="gary_s_witlen" startTime="415.770" stopTime="455.097">
            <label>Mr. Gary S. Witlen</label>
            <text syncTime="415.770" offset="1810534">If we were to address that question prior to Calhoon and ignoring the prior cases of this Court we would say that the public policy issues and the legislative history arguments clearly discern a congressional intent that there be no pro-election Title I relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.810" offset="1870615">The arguments that we made were in recognition of the language in Calhoon and in Bachowski that seems to recognize some appropriate role for a court under Title I.--</text>
            <text syncTime="441.384" offset="1912934">Therefore, the line we are asking is a line that we would be happy to see the Court extend, i.e., to say there is no Title I relief, but we think that the line can be drawn in our favor in this case without going that far.</text>

            <text syncTime="469.280" offset="2024529">Our basic theory is that once you get to the point where the only remedy in order to grant the relief requested is to conduct a new election the Court does not have Title I jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="482.820" offset="2078654">The only effective remedy might be a court supervised election.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gary S. Witlen</label>
            <text syncTime="486.069" offset="2091716">I think at that point the court could have merely nullified the nomination meeting and gone back to the union and say do it again.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.973" offset="2119301">There had been no ballots printed or distributed at that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.736" offset="2134347">I agree, however, that the logic of the public policy arguments and the logic of the legislative history that is set forth in our brief is that even at that point the court should not have had Title I jurisdiction to challenge even the nomination meeting considering the nomination meeting to be part of the election.</text>

            <text syncTime="550.823" offset="2350746">The legislative history that we have been referring to, I believe, makes at least three things clear about what the intent of Congress was in passing this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.976" offset="2395363">First, is that Title IV was intended to be the specific vehicle for resolving disputes concerning the conduct of union election of officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.253" offset="2432457">That procedure and Section 402 procedures wet intended to provide the exclusive means of obtaining an order setting aside an election and providing for a rerun.</text>
            <text syncTime="582.077" offset="2475716">Finally, the statutory goals of democratic elections could not be insured by any agent of the government other than the Secretary of Labor, and it bears repeating that all of the bills considered in the House and the Senate provided that rerun elections were to be conducted by the Secretary of Labor regardless of how you happen to get to the point of having an order to rerun the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.020" offset="2575503">I submit that this case provides a textbook example of how the safeguards and objectives carefully established in Title IV will inevitably be nullified when a court acting under Title I is permitted to substitute its judgment as to how an election should be conducted for that of the Secretary, the Congress or the union involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.231" offset="2660349">For example, the statute specifies that elections are to be conducted no less frequently than once every three years and that the winners are to be installed regardless of whether there is a challenge to the outcome of that election.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.505" offset="2713430">Well, here we did not have an election for four years, and in the interim we had lame duck officers responsible for running the union.</text>

            <text syncTime="666.637" offset="2813949">First is that in order to resolve the matters presently pending before the District Court we must have the determination from this Court as to whether the District Court had jurisdiction to issue the type of relief it ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.848" offset="2878837">Second, the Court itself has held in Glass Bottle Blowers the happenstance occurrence of an intervening election does not deprive either the Secretary or the courts of the authority to back to investigate a prior election in order to determine whether any of the alleged violations which occurred in that election could have tainted the second election.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.683" offset="2978103">We think that is certainly the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="709.666" offset="2986044">One of the issues that was never resolved by the District Court in this case was the legality of the continuous good standing requirement as a condition of eligibility to run for office.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.254" offset="3032437">That is a question that has not been resolved.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.253" offset="3040483">Finally, we believe that this case would fall within the Court's general parameters of a case capable of repetition yet evading review because of the short time limitation and the time it takes to get a case up to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.265" offset="3092519">Another statutory goal that cannot be accomplished under Title I is that of specifying that the statute only specifies minimal government intervention in union affairs and leaves it to the unions to establish rules in its bylaws as to how the election will be conducted.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.457" offset="3185201">The union has been found to be free to conduct its elections in accordance with its own procedures so long as the procedures comply with the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="769.173" offset="3224072">Here in contrast the District Court issued an injunction which provided for detailed rules, took the entire administration of the election procedures out of the hands of the union and placed them into the hands of arbitrators that it happened to find willing to conduct this type of an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.167" offset="3292094">Most importantly, congressional history indicates an intent to reserve challenges to the conduct of the election until after the election has been completed and to prevent any faction in the union from delaying the election, and even once that election was completed if a member sought to challenge its outcome, court intervention was to be delayed until after the union was given an opportunity to review the problem and attempt to redress the grievance.</text>
            <text syncTime="820.324" offset="3428767">Then if a member was dissatisfied with the union's action until the Secretary of Labor, the agent of government most familiar with the union's affairs, conducted an investigation and made a determination not only that there was a violation but the violation affected the outcome of the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="838.474" offset="3501283">Elections were not to be set aside merely for technical violations, and they were only to be set aside after a hearing on the merits of a case.</text>
            <text syncTime="847.486" offset="3537332">Here the relief that was granted was granted after a hearing on a preliminary injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="854.265" offset="3564499">There never was a hearing on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="856.670" offset="3574112">The Respondents were not required to exhaust the internal union procedures, and the union was not given full advantage of those procedures to remedy this matter itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.977" offset="3619356">There was no compliance with the time limitations which severely restrict the amount of time that the Secretary of Labor has to investigate a complaint and file a suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.551" offset="3661675">Most importantly the procedures entirely ignored the Secretary of Labor, precluding him from investigating the complaint, precluding him from being able to attempt to settle a complaint before it was actually filed in court, precluding him from serving as a screening agent to prevent the court from spending time on frivolous issues, and preventing him from consolidating all of the potential litigation concerning the outcome of the election in one proceeding before one court.</text>
            <text syncTime="913.693" offset="3802214">In fact, by deciding some of the issues here under Title I but deferring other issues for a Title IV proceeding, the District Court in essence insured that there will be two elections, two suits to challenge the outcome of this election.</text>
            <text syncTime="930.405" offset="3869087">Indeed, by not resolving the 24 consecutive month continuous good standing eligibility requirement the court did not even guarantee that his own election was to be protected from a challenge after that election had been challenged.</text>
            <text syncTime="946.696" offset="3934184">Thus, we do not believe that the statutory goals can be accomplished in a proceeding under Title I.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.660" offset="3978070">For that reason we do not believe that it can ever be appropriate within the meaning of Section 102 for a court acting under Title I to grant the relief of ordering a union to conduct a new election of officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1233.579" offset="5081691">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1237.124" offset="5095902">Let me begin by saying a word about the question that Justice Brennan asked, how if the Secretary had conducted this election might it have been run differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1249.120" offset="5143863">Let me give a few general examples and then a few specific examples.</text>
            <text syncTime="1254.242" offset="5164343">Section 402 of Title IV Says that when elections are to be rerun they are to be rerun in accordance with regulations that the Secretary is to promulgate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.596" offset="5217841">Those regulations appear in part in 452 of 29 CFR.</text>
            <text syncTime="1272.235" offset="5236336">I think it goes without saying that in running the election the Secretary would be more familiar with the operation of those regulations than would a court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1280.124" offset="5267892">The second difference is that this is the first time that the district judge had rerun a teamster election, and he was no doubt not as familiar with the teamster's constitution and bylaws as the Secretary would be because this would not be the first time the Secretary had rerun a teamster's election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1300.115" offset="5347931">Some more particular examples might be one of the things that we do not find in the District Court's injunction that the Secretary does do in the course of elections is to read all of the publications that are sent out in the course of the election, not just campaign materials, but the Secretary rereads the proofs of the newspaper that the union circulates, for example, to make sure that it does not support one side rather than the other.</text>
            <text syncTime="1327.933" offset="5459108">You do not see any provision for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1329.338" offset="5464751">So in that sense the Secretary would often do more than the District Court, and in some cases the Secretary would do less than the District Court did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.225" offset="5492336">For example, the injunction here provides that the arbitrators were actually to run the nominations meeting so that means somebody would be up at the podium running the meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.033" offset="5531520">When the Secretary has a nominations meeting rerun they have a pre-election conference at which the rules for conducting the meeting will be set out, and there will be an observer there to take notes to make sure that things to all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="1363.230" offset="5600378">But it will not actually be run by the Secretary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.963" offset="5615321">So sometimes they do more.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.634" offset="5622008">Sometimes they do less.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.525" offset="5625561">Sometimes they simply do things differently.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.977" offset="5631307">For example, in the joint appendix I notice in the District Court's docket that one of the issues that arose in the course of this election was a question about whether James Miller was eligible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1385.267" offset="5688463">Under the District Court's injunction those questions about eligibility were to be determined in the first instance by the arbitrators and then taken to court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1397.795" offset="5738618">If the Secretary had been rerunning the election and there were nothing faulty about the union's own procedures toward determining eligibility requirements the appeals on eligibility questions would have followed those normal procedures to the union's general president and then the general executive board and then to the Secretary.</text>

            <text syncTime="1516.090" offset="6211748">The Secretary does give plenty of room for Title I.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.995" offset="6223451">The line that we would draw is that... Let me back up just one step and tell you where we get.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.978" offset="6251350">In the statute we think Congress could have been a little bit more explicit than it was about how Titles I and IV ought to fit together, but we think it gave at least three signals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.425" offset="6293146">The first of those is that Section 402 sets out a very detailed system, which Mr. Witlen outlined, for rerunning elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.373" offset="6336927">The second signal is that Section 102 as you suggested cautions the district courts in Title I cases that they are to provide only such relief as is appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.698" offset="6374230">The third signal that Congress gave is in Section 403 which says that the Title IV procedure for challenging an election which has been already conducted shall be exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1567.490" offset="6417384">Now, that language does not solve this case completely or we would not be here, but its purpose, I think, provides considerable assistance because the reason Congress put it in the statute was that Congress did not want the courts rerunning elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.407" offset="6473077">In line with all of that the line that we would propose for accommodating these is that Title I relief should never be considered appropriate under Section 102 if Title IV relief is adequate to resolve the election violations that are being complained of.</text>
            <text syncTime="1602.024" offset="6555520">Let me give an example or two about what kinds of Title I relief would be appropriate in the context of union officer elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.582" offset="6593763">One is the Finnegan case that this Court decided two years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.502" offset="6609436">That involved complaints about equal rights and free speech in the context of a union officer election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.093" offset="6635768">You may recall that there a union's business representative had been discharged after supporting the incumbents who lost the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1631.543" offset="6673593">In that sort of case there is not relief available under Title IV because what he wanted was reinstatement, and running a new election would not give him that necessarily.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.273" offset="6708493">Let me give another example.</text>
            <text syncTime="1642.163" offset="6716121">In the Sadlowski case decided the same term as Finnegan there was again a complaint about free speech rights in connection with a union officer election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.081" offset="6759797">There the complaint was that the union had improperly amended its constitution to forbid nonmember campaign contributions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1661.110" offset="6791876">In that case Title IV relief would not be adequate because there was not an election even on the horizon.</text>

            <text syncTime="1997.036" offset="8135614">The mootness issue here is primarily one of whether a party may seek to disturb on appeal portions of a District Court order to which it stipulated, namely, the running of a new election.</text>

            <text syncTime="2021.620" offset="8233939">They specifically stipulated to a new election in an attempt to deprive the court of jurisdiction, and I mention only after, Your Honor, they heard the evidence in the preliminary injunction hearings did they make that offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2040.285" offset="8308545">It was not because of the temporary restraining order, Justice White, but after they heard the evidence that they made that offer when they realized this was going to be rerun at one point or another, and it would be less disruptive and less unsettling to the union to rerun it sooner rather than later.</text>

            <text syncTime="2067.852" offset="8418782">They did not feel it was all right for the court to run the election, and in fact that is why the factors mentioned by the government existed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2077.175" offset="8456085">The union refused to run the election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2079.925" offset="8467161">The union refused to run the election meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2082.610" offset="8477818">The union refused to name arbitrators.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.798" offset="8486596">The union, in fact, blocked the triple A from being the arbitrators rather than honor ballot association by calling them up and telling them they did not approve of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.872" offset="8522958">The union did not have any publications to be sent out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.840" offset="8542811">It did not have any publications that were sent out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.463" offset="8553260">So it was not because the Secretary did not run this election, that the union was not involved in the meeting or in determining who was going to run that meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.037" offset="8591608">It was because the union refused to, and strictly because the union refused to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2117.128" offset="8615954">Now, the second issue in this litigation is as was mentioned by Justice O'Connor and Justice Marshall whether the election has become moot as a result of the December, 1983 election, and I suggest you have to really stretch the imagination as the Secretary of Labor did to come up with a reason why this case is not moot on that account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.040" offset="8715533">Lastly the one question on the merits that is before the Court is whether a district court is so restricted in its remedial powers under Title I of the Landrum Griffin Act that it cannot order minimal supervision and the few terms it actually imposed on the union to remedy the flagrant violations of Title I that occurred in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.266" offset="8808529">Now, I ask the Court to consider the fact that when a Title IV election is rerun it is the court, not the Secretary of Labor, that sets the terms for rerunning that election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.385" offset="8860983">It is the Secretary of Labor who investigates the complaint and who goes and observes the election, but it is the court that sets the terms.</text>

            <text syncTime="2228.537" offset="9061603">What opposing parties argue here is not the court lacked jurisdiction because the Secretary concedes that as do the union and the government and the AFL-CIO.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.702" offset="9134223">What they do argue in essence is that the only power a court has is to grant damages in a situation such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.962" offset="9175288">I point out to Your Honors that this election suit was filed three weeks after the nomination meeting, just one week later than the union says would have been proper and all right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.911" offset="9227115">There is nothing in the record to indicate when the ballots went out, but I suggest that if they had gone out by the three week time they probably had gone out by the two week time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2279.298" offset="9264627">In fact, to rule that when the ballots go out is the determining factor gives every union a way out of getting any relief under Title I.</text>
            <text syncTime="2288.762" offset="9302452">As soon as nominations are made you walk over to the printer, xerox your ballots and you mail them out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.965" offset="9319275">It takes a day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.637" offset="9321992">Nobody can get into court with that speed and get relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2297.166" offset="9336098">Now, an award of damages cannot correct a violation in a nomination meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.583" offset="9369743">It cannot correct a violation that takes place during an electoral process but before the conclusion of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.723" offset="9394298">All it can do is attach a stigma to the person who complains about the violation of having gotten damages against the union, taken money out of the treasury of the union for him or herself, a stigma that they cannot get rid of.</text>
            <text syncTime="2329.012" offset="9463471">Now if they had accomplished something else, gotten a new election run, in the process that stigma would not be serious, but having no other--</text>

            <text syncTime="2413.384" offset="9800973">That is a determination of fact that Judge Keeton made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2417.680" offset="9818109">The proposition that damages are the only relief that can be effectively granted in an electoral process under Title I flies in the face of the legislative history, the language and this Court's interpretation of the Act, and it is incompatible with the primary purpose of the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2435.250" offset="9888431">In Hall v. Coal this Court determined that district courts have great flexibility and discretion in fashioning appropriate remedies for violations of Title I.</text>

            <text syncTime="2456.148" offset="9972023">To separate those two propositions from each other, to except the one from the other and visa versa largely nullifies Title I in what this Court has determined to be the most important area for its functioning, and I would also suggest virtually the only area in which members of unions interested in promoting democracy in their union in fact do come forward and act.</text>

            <label>Mr. Mark D. Stern</label>
            <text syncTime="3378.321" offset="13660721">In published regulations and after analyzing the union's rules and regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3382.865" offset="13678903">If you look at 402(a)(2)(b)... excuse me, 402(b) of the statute... try once more, 402(a)(2) of the statute provides that the order received by the Secretary is to direct the conduct of an election or hearing and vote upon the removal of officers under the supervision of the Secretary and in accordance with the provisions of this Title and such rules and regulations as the Secretary may proscribe, the first statutory misconstruction that was presented to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="3417.899" offset="13819023">The second statutory misconstruction is Mr. Stern's statement that the Congress decided that where there was a violation with the statute in connection with an election those officers should be displaced and new officers should be implaced.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.049" offset="13879627">Clearly the statute provides in 402(a)(2) that in the interim when an election has been challenged the affairs of the organization shall be conducted by the officers elected and in such other manner as the constitution and bylaws may provide.</text>
            <text syncTime="3449.652" offset="13945978">Even where the election has been challenged, and remember there is a presumption to the validity of that election, but even where it has been challenged the officers elected most recently take office and run the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="3461.990" offset="13995402">That did not happen here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.505" offset="14001463">For an entire year we had lame duck officers running the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.753" offset="14018390">A moment about the way the union proposed the stipulations so-called.</text>
            <text syncTime="3474.391" offset="14045035">The union offered to conduct a new election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3477.062" offset="14055693">Now if as Mr. Stern says there were in fact massive violations here and the union was recalcitrant then this Court cannot accept his further conclusion that unions will also take the two and a half years to litigate to death any suit of the Secretary of Labor because here in fact once those violations became obvious and once the litigation problems became obvious the union here offered to conduct a new election and to grant the plaintiffs exactly the type of remedy they were looking for so long as the District Court modified its temporary restraining order to allow the union to conduct it under its own rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.188" offset="14208143">The District Court refused to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3517.780" offset="14218592">Thereafter we engaged in seven months worth of negotiation over a preliminary injunction during which in answer to your question, Justice Brennan, the union repeatedly raised the argument as to the District Court's jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.789" offset="14290586">There are citations in the briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="3537.475" offset="14297273">I would also refer you to Joint Appendix 111 and 112, which is the clearest statement with counsel for the union saying, Your Honor, we don't agree to any of this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3546.768" offset="14334472">Regardless of who you appoint, we object to your fundamental authority to appoint or to set aside the results and the court saying yes, I understand that, but we appreciate your participation in these discussions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3558.529" offset="14381492">So it is great misstatement of the record, and in fact the Court of Appeals found that the union did not agree to the terms of the election that the court ordered.</text>
            <text syncTime="3567.854" offset="14418795">If we accept Mr. Stern's contention that the 1983 election moots this case, then we are left in the anomolous position on the basis of Glass Bottle Blowers that only the Secretary can fully litigate a Title IV complaint and only where he loses at the district court because if the union loses at the district court and then is subsequently caught up in its next regularly scheduled election then that suit may be mooted out by the conduct of that election.</text>
            <text syncTime="3601.995" offset="14555363">I suggest that is not before the union the due process rights that is inferred.</text>
