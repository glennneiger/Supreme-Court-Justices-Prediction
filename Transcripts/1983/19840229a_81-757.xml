            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="140992">We will hear arguments first this morning in Allen against Wright and the consolidated case.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.456" offset="182788">Mr. Solicitor General.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="12.991" stopTime="408.649">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="12.991" offset="192923">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.959" offset="212776">This lawsuit was brought as a class action by parents of black students attending desegregating public publics in seven states and seeking to represent a nationwide class of several million parents similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.386" offset="274530">The relief that they seek is not desegregation of a public school nor admission of any child to any school, public or private.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.408" offset="310579">Rather, they seek an order that the Internal Revenue Service change its standards for determining the tax exempt status of private schools which their children neither attend nor seek to attend located in or serving desegregating public school districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.120" offset="381423">The Plaintiffs lack standing to bring this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.924" offset="396679">They lack standing for two separate reasons, each of which is independently dispositive and each of which is squarely based on a holding by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.064" offset="445162">I will discuss each of those two holdings separately, and the first is Valley Forge Christian College versus Americans United for Separation of Church and State.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.103" offset="481315">Valley Forge makes clear that without exception, even in establishment clause cases, there is no standing to sue for the purpose of assuring that the Federal Government faithfully observe a particular plaintiff's view of the requirements of a particular provision of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="109.286" offset="578073">The constitutionally irreduceable minimum requirement of injury in fact must be an injury that is more narrow in scope than breach of the interest shared by all citizens in assuring that Government steer clear of any particular kind of governmental conduct, such as giving financial aid to a church or to a discriminating school or violates the ineligibility clause or the accounts clause or the incompatibility clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.190" offset="709730">If any exception to that general principle, which reaches all the way back for 60 years to Frothingham versus Mellon, were to be acknowledged, the strongest possible case for an exception existed in Valley Forge itself, because, as stressed by the dissents in that case, one of the central functions of the establishment clause is to prevent precisely what the plaintiffs were alleging in Valley Forge, namely direct governmental aid to religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.395" offset="830520">The Court very correctly ruled that there is no exception, even for establishment clause cases, and thereby established that Article III has independent constitutional significance of its own and the standing issue is to be considered prior to and independent of any other constitutional issue whose substance the plaintiffs seek to vindicate.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.193" offset="929681">The other case whose holding also squarely controls, though for quite different reasons, is Simon versus Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Organization, whose facts are remarkably similar to the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.853" offset="984329">Simon held that indigent persons and organizations lack standing to challenge the tax exempt status of hospitals which refused fully to service the indigent, and the reason that they lacked standing was because one could only speculate whether the relief that they sought, namely the revocation of the exemptions, would in fact cure the injury on which their standing was based, namely the unavailability of hospital services.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.955" offset="1108776">The identical defect exists in this case, as even the Court of Appeals recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.459" offset="1134794">The Court of Appeals, however, distinguished Simon from this case on the ground that school desegregation cases in that court's view call for a different, more relaxed set of standing requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="264.321" offset="1198220">The court concluded that three of this Court's desegregation decisions, Norwood, Gilmore and Green, were in tension with Simon and that the court was therefore forced to select from two divergent lines of Supreme Court decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.629" offset="1251405">In fact, I submit there is no divergence at all and Simon squarely governs for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="284.651" offset="1279513">The first is that the notion that for purposes of determining standing there is any difference between school desegregation cases on the one hand and hospital discrimination cases on the other, that the weight of the Article III burden somehow shifts, diminishes or increases according to the nature or importance of the substantive claim was squarely rejected by this Court and expressly rejected by this Court in Valley Forge, which came down after the Court of Appeals' decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="317.456" offset="1410752">Second, even considered in isolation, the decisions in Norwood, Gilmore and Green do not establish any doctrinal enclave for standing a desegregation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.578" offset="1451294">Indeed, in our view they establish very few standing principles at all because, as Judge Tamm pointed out in dissent, they were not standing cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="337.334" offset="1490269">The defendants in Norwood and Gilmore were the State of Mississippi and the City of Montgomery, the precise governmental bodies that had discriminated against these claimants in prior precise desegregation suits because of the race of those plaintiffs, Norwood, Gilmore, and their colleagues.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.699" offset="1583787">Having in both cases been parties to specific desegregation decrees, the plaintiffs in Norwood and Gilmore brought suit directly against those who had discriminated against them and, as the Court observed in Gilmore, the relief that they sought was directly related to the concrete injury they suffered.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.196" offset="1661736">Here, by contrast, the suit is against the revenue collector and not against the discriminator.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.934" offset="1688695">With regard to the summary affirmance in Green, the standing issue was not squarely presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.671" offset="1711578">This Court's ruling was only a summary affirmance, and this Court later observed that because the Government and the plaintiffs in that case were in agreement, the Court's affirmance in Green lacks the precedential weight of a case involving a truly adversary controversy.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="408.649" stopTime="418.655">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="408.649" offset="1775526">Well, I suppose, however, the Court had to assume standing existed to have entered the order it did.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.453" offset="1802798">So it's much harder to explain, I think.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="418.655" stopTime="456.113">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="418.655" offset="1815545">It is correct, Justice O'Connor, that any court necessarily holds that there is standing in any decision where it renders a substantive decision on the merits.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.046" offset="1865074">However, even if you get over the Valley Forge hurdle, which I submit you can't in this instance, which came down after the Court of Appeals' decision, so that you have to weigh the persuasive merits of a Green decision on the one hand and a Simon on the other, which came down after Green, certainly for reasons set forth in this Court's first Bob Jones decision the Green decision is of less persuasive merit.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="sandra_day_oconnor" startTime="456.113" stopTime="516.669">
            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="456.113" offset="1965384">As long as you're interrupted, may I ask you another question.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.815" offset="1980221">The plaintiffs below alleged that the Internal Revenue Service had violated with the tax exemption practice several specific sections or at least one section of the Revenue Code, and a violation of Title VI was alleged, and a violation of Section 1981 and I guess the Fifth Amendment itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="486.132" offset="2085443">Now, in your view is it unlawful for the Internal Revenue Service under any of those sections or provisions to follow the policy it did on the tax exemption if the Internal Revenue Service does not know that the school is discriminating racially?</text>
            <text syncTime="513.783" offset="2196097">Is knowledge an element?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="516.669" stopTime="593.234">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="516.669" offset="2207591">Under the present procedure that is followed by the Internal Revenue Service, and a perfectly acceptable procedure, knowledge is gained by the devices that are available to the Internal Revenue Service, and certainly they cannot revoke the tax exemptions of any entity whom they do not know to be discriminating.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.100" offset="2305289">But they do the best job that they can of finding out who those discriminators are and then revoking their tax exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="547.706" offset="2331725">If there are 1981 violations, then there should be 1981 suits brought against the discriminators.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.794" offset="2364117">If there are Title VI violations, then Title VI suits should be brought against the discriminators.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.049" offset="2389090">But it is an entirely different issue for the competitors or the adversaries in 1981 suit on a Title VI suit to go beyond bringing the direct suit to cure the particular injury in fact that they had and seek to employ the machinery of the Internal Revenue Service to impose a heavier burden on their adversary or their competitor.</text>

            <text syncTime="857.969" offset="3572855">It does... as I said a moment ago, Justice Blackmun, it did present the strongest possible case for an exception to the general principle that had beer established in Frothingham versus Bellen, Schlesinger, Richardson, and so forth, in that the establishment clause apart from any other provision of the Constitution does, as the dissents in that case noted, specifically... or one of its central functions is to guarantee against direct Government aid to religion, so that in the establishment clause context, arguably the Constitution itself creates standing, just like a statute can create standing.</text>
            <text syncTime="901.812" offset="3748189">Now, that proposition lost five to four and that was a correct decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="913.020" offset="3793015">Well, I think the Court is greatly strengthening the Article III principle with its decision in Valley Forge.</text>
            <text syncTime="922.744" offset="3831885">But in any event, to whatever extent there might be a separate consideration for establishment clause cases, that does not obtain in a case such as this.</text>
            <text syncTime="936.985" offset="3888832">Now, the only issue in this case, as I say, is not whether there should be tax exemptions for racially discriminatory schools; the only issue is, out of three possible alternatives... and so far as I know, to date there are only three possible alternatives... which is the best of these three alternatives for identifying which are the racially discriminatory schools and then revoking their tax exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="966.254" offset="4005965">Those three alternatives are: the existing procedure that is now followed, Revenue Procedure 75-50; the 1978 and 1979 regulations; and what the plaintiffs are seeking in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.081" offset="4061240">It is not at all apparent which of those is the best approach, as is shown by the difficulty that Congress has had and the Internal Revenue Service has had in selecting among those three approaches.</text>
            <text syncTime="994.524" offset="4119023">What this case really boils down to is an attempt by these plaintiffs to take the resolution, the choice among those three policy choices, away from the political branches and secure their first choice of alternative by judicial decree, and that is clearly outside the bounds of standing to sue in a federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1017.103" offset="4209302">Let me make just one final point, and it is that this is an income tax case, the standing rules should apply across the board to all substantive matters that come before the federal courts, but that there is an extra layer of consideration in income tax cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.969" offset="4300835">Taxpayers do have standing to seek review of their own tax liability and, as occurred in Taxation with Representation last year, they may challenge the tax treatment of others where it is relevant to their our claims for consistent treatment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1055.063" offset="4361230">To go beyond that, we submit, would be both unprecedented and also unwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.216" offset="4385785">It would put in the hands of adversaries and competitors of the taxpayer a powerful weapon which would not only distort the adversarial and competitive processes, but also, in the language of this Court in Louisiana versus McAdoc,</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.409" offset="4438553">"operate to disturb the whole revenue system of the Government. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.094" offset="4453286">This does not mean that the revenue laws will go unenforced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1081.880" offset="4468437">It just means that the enforcement will be uniform, accomplished by Government, as prescribed and overseen by Congress, rather than exists as a weapon to be picked up at will by those who wish to inflict additional burdens on fellow citizens with whom they disagree.</text>

            <text syncTime="1132.579" offset="4671252">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.598" offset="4683372">The Intervenor, Reverend Wayne Allen, first learned of this case when he read about it in the newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1142.286" offset="4710122">What he learned was that Respondents, parents with school attending desegregated public schools, had filed suit in the District of Columbia seeking to have the court require the IRS to revoke the tax exempt status of 3500 non-party private schools, including the school that Reverend Allen had founded in Memphis, Tennessee.</text>
            <text syncTime="1170.604" offset="4823389">Although each of these schools professed under penalty of perjury to have an open admissions policy and Respondents had not been denied admission to any of these schools, Respondents sought a blanket condemnation of all these schools and revocation of the schools' tax exemption based upon an irrebuttable presumption of discrimination, primarily as a result of the school's failure to attract its quota of minority students.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.825" offset="4952225">Prior to Reverend Allen's intervention, no party had any interest in the rights of these 3500 schools, whose rights would be drastically affected by Respondents' desired remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1216.252" offset="5005932">Respondents' had never sought admission to any of these schools, had no desire to attend any of these schools, had never been deterred from applying to any of these schools, and of course had never been discriminated against by any of these schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.611" offset="5071343">The IRS likewise had no stake in protecting the interests of the schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.765" offset="5096003">The lack of adverseness between the IRS and Respondents was demonstrated even after Reverend Allen intervened.</text>
            <text syncTime="1247.121" offset="5129439">While the motions to dismiss were pending in the district court, the IRS and Respondents spent hundreds of hours in settlement negotiations trying to agree on what procedure should be applied to the private schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1262.630" offset="5191506">Reverend Allen, the only party representing the interests of any of these schools, wasn't even informed of those negotiations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.803" offset="5228182">He learned of them then the IRS announced to the press and the court that the IRS proposed to adopt a new revised procedure which embodied most of Respondents' presumption of guilt criteria, despite this Court's admonition in Norwood that no one can be required, consistent with due process, to prove absence of violation of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1298.371" offset="5334448">It's not uncommon for the IRS to defend actions in that manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="1303.707" offset="5355764">That is, responding initially to suits involving the rights of third parties by saying, you can't sue me, but then turning around and asking, well, what do you want?</text>
            <text syncTime="1314.332" offset="5398292">That is precisely what the IRS did in the Green case relied upon by Respondents.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.819" offset="5420234">The ironic result is that the Green case resulted in the adoption of Revenue Procedure 75-50, which Respondents now seek to challenge as inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="1331.710" offset="5467777">In fact, in the 1974 Bob Jones decision this Court commented on the lack of an adversary contest in Green.</text>
            <text syncTime="1340.400" offset="5502572">The point is, if Reverend Allen had not read about this case in the newspaper his rights and those of 3500 non-party schools could have been drastically affected in a suit in the District of Columbia in which persons likely to be most directly affected by the order were not before the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1361.579" offset="5587209">There is no guarantee that in future actions of this sort that an interested party will learn of the case and intervene, which emphasizes the importance of deciding issues and rights of such magnitude only in truly adversarial contests.</text>
            <text syncTime="1379.275" offset="5658053">This Court's decisions, as the Solicitor General said, in Eastern Kentucky and Valley Forge make clear that injury sufficient to give standing must be distinct, concrete, personal injury to the plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.050" offset="5721165">A generalized citizen's grievance or a shared right to have the Constitution... to have the Government act in accordance with the claimant's views of the Constitution is not sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="1407.108" offset="5769335">Respondents' asserted injury falls squarely within the meaning of those cases, the holding in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.798" offset="5800159">Their injury, as characterized by the Court of Appeals, is the denigration they suffered as black parents and school children when the Government graces with tax exempt status educational institutions in their communities that treat members of their race as persons of lesser worth.</text>
            <text syncTime="1435.027" offset="5881034">The statement of injury presumably is derived from the steer-clear language in Norwood, a school case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1443.633" offset="5915516">But there's no principled basis for a separate standing rule as to schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1449.121" offset="5937459">So to recognize standing on the basis asserted by Respondents would mean that these same Respondents have standing to challenge all charitable tax exemptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.095" offset="5985315">For example, they would have standing to sue seeking to require the IRS to revoke the 501(c)(3) status of all troops of Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts which do not have their quota of minorities.</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.314" offset="6314145">You don't argue that in your brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1545.915" offset="6324594">Is that because there aren't currently such riders and you think that's moot now?</text>

            <text syncTime="1551.502" offset="6346954">The riders expired in 1982, but I think that the fact that Congress considered those and addressed this question shows that this matter is appropriately one to be decided by the Executive Branch with oversight by Congress, as Solicitor Lee said.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.400" offset="6422501">As I was saying, this Court specifically addressed and rejected the precise standing argument advanced by Respondents in Moose Lodge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.689" offset="6467745">There the Court restricted Mr. Irvis' standing to a challenge of the type of discriminatory conduct to which he had been subjected, and rejected Justice Douglas' argument in his dissent which would have given standing to any black citizen in Pennsylvania to bring suit against the state whenever any other citizen had been discriminated against.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.371" offset="6562412">So to allow Respondents standing necessarily would require this Court to overrule Moose Lodge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1612.358" offset="6590416">But there's no necessity to reach such a result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1615.327" offset="6602223">As I stated, if Respondents applied to a private school and they'd been denied admission, they have a direct remedy against that school and that would be an adversarial contest that would be under this Court's opinion in Runyon versus McCrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1629.986" offset="6660842">Second, if Respondents wish to complain that any particular private school is discriminating but is still retaining its tax exempt status, they can avail themselves of the current Revenue Procedure 75-50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.281" offset="6730014">Section 6 under that procedure invites information about such schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.185" offset="6753629">Respondents not only have failed to do so, but they failed to allege that if they advised the IRS it would fail to act on that information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.041" offset="6789155">In fact, although I can't speak for all the other schools which were named as examples in the complaint, I know that they named Reverend Allen's school as an example of a segregated school which was tax exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.181" offset="6845684">Immediately following Reverend Allen's intervention in this suit, the IRS audited his school and found it to be nondiscriminatory.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.621" offset="6879434">The Respondents named the Prince Edward school in the complaint as an example of a discriminatory school with tax exempt status.</text>
            <text syncTime="1692.143" offset="6909528">The IRS audited Prince Edward and revoked its tax exempt status, which this Court upheld, as the IRS has done to some 106 other schools which were found to be discriminatory.</text>

            <text syncTime="1861.283" offset="7586099">Basically, the injury in the case as we see it is the same as the injury in Brown, as that injury was elaborated upon in Green versus New Kent County Schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.594" offset="7655271">It's the Government participation in the denial of the right of school children to attend a desegregated public school system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.402" offset="7706576">And what we say basically is that the grant of significant financial assistance to a discriminatory private school is the legal equivalent for equal protection purposes of operating that segregated system itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1911.382" offset="7786510">So that I would say in answer to your question that the second aspect of injury alleged in the complaint is basically simply an elaboration of the first.</text>

            <text syncTime="2038.481" offset="8294853">Because the black students that attend public schools in desegregating public school districts are particularly injured by the fact that the Government is supporting racially segregated private schools in those districts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2072.385" offset="8430481">But it's very difficult for me to see that there is no difference in terms of the impact of the injury on the children of, let's say, Respondent Inez Wright, who attend the Briarcrest school system... who attend the public school systems in Memphis and attend a 99 percent black high school in Memphis, where the Government is at the same time providing tax exemptions to the Briarcrest school system, which is racially segregated and which Judge McCray has said is impeding public school desegregation.</text>
