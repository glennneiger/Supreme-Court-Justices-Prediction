            <label>Mr. Richard R. Dailey</label>
            <text syncTime="56.253" offset="367270">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="59.539" offset="380435">This is an appeal from a decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.823" offset="401542">It brings into question the validity under the Constitution of a gross receipts tax imposed by the State of West Virginia upon the appellant Armco as a result of Armco's sale of property to customers in West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.218" offset="467162">The issues presented are two.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.320" offset="479492">The first is whether these was a sufficient nexus between the transactions involved here and the State of West Virginia; and the second is whether the tax involved here is invalid because it discriminates against interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.014" offset="538319">Armco is an Ohio corporation which for many years has been qualified to do business in West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.519" offset="568308">During the period 1970 through 1975, the audit periods involved here, its connection with the State of West Virginia was of three sorts.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.958" offset="610104">First, it operated a substantial coal mining venture in West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.112" offset="630688">Second, it operated a small office in South Charleston from which it sold construction and drainage products.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.183" offset="659005">And third, it sold to customers in West Virginia products manufactured outside of West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.872" offset="685754">The tax liabilities owed by Armco to West Virginia from the operation of its coal mines and from the operation of its Charleston office are not at issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.477" offset="728177">What is at issue here are sales of three products manufactured by Armco outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.500" offset="756285">Those products are metal buildings, steel and wire rope.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.702" offset="777079">These sales have many characteristics in common.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.356" offset="791707">Not only were the materials manufactured outside of West Virginia, there was no sales office involved in West Virginia, no resident salesman in West Virginia, no inventory in West Virginia; orders were accepted outside West Virginia, and the goods were delivered to common carriers outside West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.151" offset="870806">The products themselves were marked in West Virginia in two different ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.654" offset="896824">The metal buildings were sold to two franchised dealers within West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.141" offset="918767">There was no solicitation of these sales in West Virginia, simply franchise agreements pursuant to which Armco agreed that the dealers could use the Armco name, and Armco agreed to share advertising expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.151" offset="978848">The steel and wire rope products were solicited, sales were solicited within West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.507" offset="1008314">In connection with the steel products, four nonresident salesmen visited West Virginia on an average of once every four to six weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.262" offset="1047289">And with regard to the wire rope, three nonresident salesmen visited West Virginia every two to four weeks.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.202" offset="1083025">The tax involved here is an annual privilege tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.689" offset="1100997">It is imposed upon the gross receipts of those who are engaged or continuing within West Virginia in the selling of tangible property at wholesale.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.914" offset="1145927">The lower court in West Virginia held that the transactions involved here did not have a sufficient nexus to permit taxation under the Due Process Clause and the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.805" offset="1193470">The court of appeals or the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.541" offset="1220429">My remarks today will address three points.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.612" offset="1240700">The first point is the conclusion of the court below that the unitary business theory should be applied to find the appropriate nexus here.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.920" offset="1289914">The second point is the assertion that even if the unitary business theory is not applicable here, there was a sufficient nexus between these transactions and the taxing jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.228" offset="1339129">And the third is Armco's claim that this tax is unconstitutional because it discriminates against interstate commerce.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="310.118" offset="1382701">Mr. Dailey, it would be helpful to me if sometime in your argument you could describe with perhaps some particularity exactly what transactions of Armco West Virginia seeks to tax here.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.878" offset="1441738">As I understand it, they're not trying to level a gross receipts tax or a privilege tax on all the income from Armco wherever received.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.651" offset="1484892">They're trying to levy a tax on transactions which they claim, and you deny, have some nexus with West Virginia.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_r_dailey" startTime="342.840" stopTime="344.357">
            <label>Mr. Richard R. Dailey</label>
            <text syncTime="342.840" offset="1513627">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="344.357" stopTime="347.892">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="344.357" offset="1519687">Just sales to West Virginia customers, right?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_r_dailey" startTime="347.892" stopTime="547.604">
            <label>Mr. Richard R. Dailey</label>
            <text syncTime="347.892" offset="1533794">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.442" offset="1535988">If the tax is imposed on the gross receipts from sales of wire rope, steel and metal buildings only to customers in West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.200" offset="1579038">This Court has stated that a state tax on income must be applied through an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.674" offset="1632954">The court below concluded, on the other hand, that it did not need to examine the connection between these transactions and the State of West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.732" offset="1673183">It reached that result because it applied a unitary business theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="387.850" offset="1693663">It said that Armco was a unitary business operating under a single corporate umbrella, and that since its activities in the area of coal mining were substantial in West Virginia, that justified them in taxing the gross receipts from these sales without inquiry as to whether there was any nexus between the sales and the State of West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.065" offset="1790525">This is a rather dramatic departure from prior decisions of this Court and, we submit, is wholly inappropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.588" offset="1824589">The unitary business theory arose in response to a peculiar problem posed by net income taxes.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.444" offset="1860011">The problem is that it is difficult to figure out how much of a corporation's net income might properly be said to be attributable to any given taxing jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="442.937" offset="1914032">Accordingly, under the theory, with which this Court has some familiarity, the total net income of a taxpayer unitary business is peculiar, and then that income is apportioned among the various taxing states on the basis of formulas.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.600" offset="1992608">The problem of not being able to compute the proper amount of income attributable to any state and thus the occasion for the unitary business theory simply is not present in the case of a gross receipts tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.110" offset="2054675">We know to a penny Armco's gross receipts from West Virginia sales, and there is simply no occasion for the theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.466" offset="2092083">More important, the application here of the unitary business theory would evidently remove all constitutional restraints on the ability of West Virginia to tax Armco sales.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.642" offset="2152791">Suppose, for example, that West Virginia asserted the right to tax property manufactured by Armco in Ohio and sold to customers in Indiana?</text>
            <text syncTime="514.033" offset="2198349">Now, I think we would all agree that West Virginia can't do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="518.235" offset="2215172">And I suspect the reason why we think West Virginia can't do that is that such a transaction has absolutely no connection to the State of West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="528.293" offset="2255400">But that the connection with the State of West Virginia is precisely what the court below said it didn't have to look at.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.315" offset="2287479">So on the whole, we suggest that the traditional nexus rules which require a substantial nexus to the activity being taxed has served us well.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="547.604" stopTime="561.514">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="547.604" offset="2332618">Yet the Supreme Court of Appeals didn't say that there need be, in this case, no nexus, because it only allowed the taxation of transactions... of sales to people in West Virginia.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_r_dailey" startTime="561.514" stopTime="581.677">
            <label>Mr. Richard R. Dailey</label>
            <text syncTime="561.514" offset="2388311">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.447" offset="2392073">And, of course, there is also a state law problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="564.716" offset="2401163">You must be found, under the state statute, to be engaged in the business of selling at wholesale in West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.636" offset="2424778">So that my example of the sale from Ohio to Indiana is a purely constitutional example, not... not... we would still have to find the business in West Virginia as a Batter of state law.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="581.677" stopTime="597.620">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="581.677" offset="2468977">But don't you think that perhaps analysis under apportioned income tax may be somewhat different than analysis under a privilege tax such as this, or do you think they're the same?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_r_dailey" startTime="597.620" stopTime="627.373">
            <label>Mr. Richard R. Dailey</label>
            <text syncTime="597.620" offset="2532716">Oh, I think the analysis of the income arising in a jurisdiction is... is the amount of income that's being taxed is quite different in a gross receipts tax case and a net income tax case.</text>
            <text syncTime="609.662" offset="2580886">As I say, in a net income tax case, it is an accounting impossibility to allocate properly the net incomes of the various taxing jurisdictions, and thus the birth of the unitary business theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.504" offset="2636265">No such problem is presented in the case of gross receipts.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="627.373" stopTime="652.956">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="627.373" offset="2651730">If Armco had organized a West Virginia corporation that owned and operated the mine, would there be any basis for any analysis of the unitary system or imposing any tax on the parent corporation?</text>

            <text syncTime="721.765" offset="3029356">Standard Pressed Steel involved a Washington tax on gross receipts from sales to a single customer in Washington.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.120" offset="3066763">Those sales were solicited by a resident of Washington who operated full-time in Washington as an employee of the seller to solicit orders from Boeing, a single customer.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.130" offset="3134786">The Standard Pressed Steel case involved a continuous presence in the State of Washington, a presence which the Court found contributed directly to the sales in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="761.806" offset="3189434">We think the same thing was true in the General Motors case; that there was a continuous and important presence within the state that contributed to the production of the sales in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="774.197" offset="3239067">Here there is no continuous presence at all in the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.601" offset="3256621">Armco's connection with the State of West Virginia so far as these sales go is really flimsy.</text>

            <text syncTime="2280.781" offset="9265412">I believe the only difference between this case and the factual circumstances of the Standard Pressed Steel case is the lack of a fixed, purely local aspect of the sales upon which to base the tax.</text>

            <text syncTime="2320.275" offset="9423400">The State of West Virginia submits that a re-evaluation of this fixed presence principle is called for in light of intervening decisions.</text>

Brady announced this Court's intention to judge state taxes' validity according to their practical economic effects, and the Appellee submits that in practical terms solicitation activities supply the same nexus as does an in-state sales operation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2378.612" offset="9656726">This Court should examine the results of Armco's in-state sales activities and not where their personnel reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="2385.433" offset="9683998">West Virginia also believes that this Court's elimination of the direct versus indirect distinction with regard to privileged taxation of interstate commerce also plainly supports their position that the solicitation activities by themselves can supply the nexus necessary to tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="2403.744" offset="9757245">In the Washington Stevedoring case, this Court held that since interstate commerce was subject to direct taxation, an activity which was essentially a part of interstate commerce could supply the nexus necessary for its taxation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.122" offset="9822760">We believe that the same logic is equally applicable to solicitation activities.</text>

            <text syncTime="3067.910" offset="12413898">As I said in the Henneford case, the sales versus use distinction was that... that possibly because it would be subject to two taxes, whereas a purely in-state activity would only be subject to one, the Court said that that necessarily wasn't a type of discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3083.003" offset="12474293">In several of this Court's decisions they've said that the vagaries of one state's taxing scheme will not be forced to concede to another's, such as the... I believe the Mobil Oil case in which it was whether or not the State of New York had the right to tax the dividends, all of the dividends, whereas there was an apportionment problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="3105.035" offset="12562378">Again, this Court said well, that may be the case, but it's not shown here, and one system shouldn't necessarily have to... have to... have to take into recognition what other states are doing.</text>

            <text syncTime="3123.580" offset="12636566">What the nexus issue I think comes down to here is this: We have only the most tenuous connection between the transactions being taxed and the State of West Virginia.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.654" offset="12684840">A handful of salesmen without authority to enter into any contractual relationships visiting West Virginia on a very infrequent basis, to tax these sales comes perilously close, I suggest, to the imposition of a state import duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.683" offset="12752967">West Virginia is attempting to charge for access to its market and so is trying to tax values realized outside the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3162.539" offset="12792360">This is precisely the type of trade barrier that the Commerce Clause was designed to prevent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3170.494" offset="12824230">Armco submits that the traditional nexus rules have served us well and should be retained.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.500" offset="12856203">We should require a continuous local presence within the taxing jurisdiction to support the imposition of an unapportioned gross receipts tax on sales.</text>
