            <text syncTime="43.077" offset="296801">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="44.362" offset="301921">May it please the Court, this case is here on a writ of certiorari to the Second District Court of Appeal of the State of Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.116" offset="332954">The question presented is whether the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a court from considering or from relying upon a subsequent interracial marriage of the custodial parent as a ground for ordering a change of custody.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.577" offset="406724">Now, if I may, the facts are straightforward in this case, and I would like to go through them very quickly and get right to the argument.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="77.750" offset="435459">Is it your contention that that's the only ground on which the judgment is based?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="robert_j_shapiro" startTime="82.135" stopTime="289.786">
            <label>Mr. Robert J. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="82.135" offset="453013">Yes, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.920" offset="456148">In this case, absolutely.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.606" offset="466910">And I'd like to explain how that occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.724" offset="483315">We had a final judgment of dissolution of marriage in this case between the petitioner and the respondent, both of whom are white.</text>
            <text syncTime="98.080" offset="516752">The custody of their three-year-old daughter was awarded to the petitioner, the mother here.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.583" offset="542770">Subsequently, the husband... the father, I'm sorry... filed a petition for modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.571" offset="570773">He alleged in his petition that the mother was living with a black man who she later married, that the child had two bouts of head lice, and that the child had been seen wearing a mildewed dress.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.266" offset="633467">Now, at the hearing on this matter, the final hearing, the parties and their new spouses testified, and the report of the Circuit Court counsel was accepted.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.907" offset="680069">The Order which the Circuit Court entered on March 1, 1982 changed custody and awarded it to the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.548" offset="726672">There were no findings made regarding the father's secondary allegations... and it was called "secondary allegations" by the trial judge... of the mildewed dress or the head lice.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.837" offset="771811">The court noted that she had lived with man before marrying him.</text>
            <text syncTime="168.260" offset="797516">But the court also held that each of the parents, the father and the mother here, were devoted parents and that each had remarried respectable spouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.834" offset="855821">And then in the important phrase in this case, the court stated:</text>
            <text syncTime="190.089" offset="884765">"This Court feels that, despite the strides that have been made in bettering relations between the races in this country, it is inevitable that Melanie will, if allowed to remain in her present situation and attain school age and, thus, more vulnerable to peer pressures, suffer from the social stigmatization that is sure to come. "</text>
            <text syncTime="208.401" offset="958012">Now, it's important to note that this is not a neglect case.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.205" offset="981313">There was no finding of neglect, contrary to respondent's arguments in his brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="218.793" offset="999599">There was no finding about lack of health care, lack of hygiene, lack of clothing or any type of neglect, and certainly no finding of any inability to cope on the part of the mother.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.148" offset="1041081">It's important to remember that in Florida, once a custody decree has been entered, the noncustodial parent has an extraordinary burden in order to change that.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.706" offset="1091237">That person must, by competent substantial evidence, show that there has been a substantial change in circumstances, and, No. 2, that there have been adverse effects on the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.501" offset="1154453">And this is because the focus is the best interest of the children, the best interest of the child.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.803" offset="1175664">And if it cannot be shown that there was a substantial change in circumstances and an adverse effect on the child, then it has not been shown that the original determination as to what was in the best interest of the child should be disturbed.</text>
            <text syncTime="277.546" offset="1234597">And the reason for this is that the custody determinations are not res judicata, but they must be given some measure of finality.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.901" offset="1268033">Otherwise, people would be changing custody on a regular basis.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert J. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="301.594" offset="1330832">Yes, Ma'am.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.010" offset="1336474">Living with the natural father in Texas, where he moved immediately after the custody determination was made in March of '82.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.216" offset="1377330">Now, our position is, and I believe that it's clear from the plain meaning of the words in the Order, that the Order was tainted with race, racial consideration, which renders it presumptively invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.411" offset="1438038">No other case so clearly rests a custody determination on racial considerations, at least that I can find in my search of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.683" offset="1483178">The child court took the remarriage of the mother into consideration solely because her new husband was black.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.373" offset="1517973">He did not consider the impact of the father's remarriage because his new wife was white.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.931" offset="1556216">Bear in mind that this was foreshadowed by the fact that the court ordered a social investigation only of the mother, despite the fact that a motion for social investigation requested a social investigation of both parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.242" offset="1633434">Having taken consideration of the remarriage, he, then, assumed that certain consequences would occur as a result of the interracial marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.616" offset="1678887">And by this, I mean that the child would suffer social stigmatization as a result of the interracial marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.806" offset="1715668">There is not one scintilla of evidence, nor is there a finding of fact that there is any adverse effect as a result of this interracial marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.546" offset="1762584">The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment embodies the belief that all persons are created equal.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.569" offset="1802708">Racial hatred and prejudice have no place in our system of law, but when this trial court held that Melanie, the child, would suffer social stigmatization as a result of the interracial marriage, he gave the racial bias of few the force of law.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.518" offset="1890479">Now, it's clear from this Court's cases, such as Cooper v. Aaron, Shelley v. Kraemer, Watson v. City of Memphis, that a court cannot bow to pressure, public pressure to protect potential victims of race discrimination from prejudice; that the desire to protect a person from racial prejudice does not justify departing from the fundamental command of the Constitution that there be equal justice under law.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.126" offset="2044915">And the concept of equal justice under law is so central to this country that it is engraved, carved into the stone of this building.</text>

            <text syncTime="520.168" offset="2205098">My position is that with... and I think the courts have said this... that the concept of adoption is different, because the state is conferring a right upon a person who is not a biological parent and, therefore, as long as there is no racial slur involved in taking that into consideration, that it may... and as long as this is not automatic, as it was here, consideration of race... that it may take race into consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.259" offset="2357444">And this was in the Drummond case, which was the Fifth Circuit case, which made reference to this Court's case in Smith v. Foster Family case, O-f-f-e-r.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.199" offset="2401225">And there's a very, very big distinction between the biological relationship and the state-conferred relationship.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert J. Shapiro</label>
            <text syncTime="628.137" offset="2636954">I don't think it was a marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="631.672" offset="2651165">I'm not absolutely certain.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.739" offset="2655449">I know that he does have another biological child of his.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.807" offset="2667674">But I can say that whatever is in this trial court's Order determined this custody determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.348" offset="2709888">And he found the man to be respectable, as was the spouse, the new spouse of the father.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.704" offset="2747295">There's no question, he says in the first paragraph, about the respectability of these new spouses.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.191" offset="2769238">Now, the other major point in this case, aside from importing racial prejudice of society into the Order of a court, is the aspect that the mother was being punished for having exercised her right to marry a person, without regard to race.</text>
            <text syncTime="685.573" offset="2866727">In Loving v. Virginia, this Court stated that a statute which provided imprisonment for interracial marriage violated the Equal Protection Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="697.781" offset="2915524">In that case, the interracial remarriage itself triggered the penalty of imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.451" offset="2942273">In this case, the interracial marriage itself triggered the forfeiture of the child, with no facts to justify the penalty.</text>
            <text syncTime="714.576" offset="2982711">The respondent misconstrues the Loving case by suggesting that the mother here is... cannot invoke the Equal Protection Clause because she is not black.</text>
            <text syncTime="727.650" offset="3035060">The fact of the matter is, Loving makes it very clear that either party of an interracial marriage can invoke the Fourteenth Amendment if the marriage is being infringed upon.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.406" offset="3070064">Now, we're not asking this Court to substitute its discretion for the trial court regarding any fitness determination or any determination of the like.</text>
            <text syncTime="752.534" offset="3134535">The trial court has already made these findings regarding the fitness of the parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="757.653" offset="3155015">There is no doubt about this.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.355" offset="3161911">We seek a ruling that the Circuit Court's Order applied an unconstitutional rule of law by relying on the fact of the interracial marriage and by allowing the existence of racial prejudice in society to dictate the nature of this custody proceeding and the Order it produced.</text>
            <text syncTime="777.733" offset="3235367">We're not asking for a ruling that the mother should be the custodial parent for all time.</text>
            <text syncTime="783.487" offset="3258355">This we cannot have, because of what I indicated earlier about the fact that custody determinations are not res judicata.</text>
            <text syncTime="794.695" offset="3303181">But again, we ask that the slate be wiped clean, and again the father is entitled to file another petition for modification if he so desires, but one which does not contain racial grounds, and contains other legitimate grounds for change of custody, if he so desires.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.191" offset="3385206">Therefore, we seek an Order revising and vacating this case, with instructions to the Second District Court of Appeal to set aside the trial court's Order on modification, thus restoring the parties to their original status under the original dissolution of marriage final judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="834.336" offset="3461797">I have some more time, and I'd like to reserve it for rebuttal, if I may, unless you have some questions of me right now.</text>

            <text syncTime="846.996" offset="3512474">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I think before we can determine that there is an impermissible classification in this particular case, there's at least six questions that have to be answered in favor of the petitioner's position... the first one being, and probably the most important... is what relationship was before the trial court?</text>
            <text syncTime="873.563" offset="3618740">The second one is, to what extent did the state have any interest in that relationship?</text>
            <text syncTime="879.301" offset="3641624">The third, did the trial court classify the relationship?</text>
            <text syncTime="883.753" offset="3659491">The fourth, did the classification, if any, result in some form of action by the state without reasonable relation to the classification?</text>
            <text syncTime="893.625" offset="3698988">Fifth, and alternatively to the last question, was the classification, if any, suspect as the rules dealing with suspect classes tell us?</text>
            <text syncTime="907.784" offset="3755622">And, if suspect, was there a compelling state interest to classify?</text>
            <text syncTime="911.938" offset="3772236">As I've indicated, I think that the most important question to determine whether this is an impermissible classification is the first one: What relationship was before the trial court?</text>
            <text syncTime="925.913" offset="3828138">We would suggest that the relationship before the trial court was the parent-child relationship; that the parent-new spouse relationship was collateral, was secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.506" offset="3886443">The cases that deal with the relationships in custody cases, in adoption cases, in the foster care cases, all seem to indicate that the parent-new spouse relationship is secondary.</text>
            <text syncTime="962.038" offset="3972647">I think the best one is the situation that existed in the Smith v. the Organization--</text>

            <text syncTime="993.891" offset="4100020">I think that the trial judge was dealing with more facts than merely the fact of race.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.795" offset="4127606">But he was dealing, was he not, with the new spouse relationship as the reason for changing custody?</text>
            <text syncTime="1006.631" offset="4151011">The mother's new relationship with the man who moved into the home and then later married her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.554" offset="4178701">It would be the respondent's position, Your Honor, that the relationship was how the mother treated that new relationship as regards to the child, and not the new relationship per se.</text>
            <text syncTime="1028.564" offset="4238678">I think it's clear from the reading of that paragraph that counsel refers to, that there are three parts to that paragraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1036.920" offset="4272115">The first part takes the new relationship out of consideration per se... the relationship per se out of consideration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.291" offset="4313597">The middle part deals with how the mother reacts to that relationship, and the third one is how the mother reacts to the child, or how the court expects the mother to react, the interplay between the mother and child as it relates to the new marriage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.289" offset="4397607">I think that's significant, in that the court is progressing, if you would, through the requirements of classification.</text>

            <text syncTime="2262.645" offset="9174985">I don't believe that the court is making the same type of presumptions as in the Kramer v. Kramer case, which is probably very close in factual, in the factual basis.</text>

            <text syncTime="2280.357" offset="9245829">Your Honor, it's the case out of Iowa that's reported in 297 N.W. 2d 359... is the one I'm referring to.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.748" offset="9299433">[Laughter]</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.498" offset="9306433">In that case, I believe there was an effort to exclude race entirely from the case, but the judge then inserted it in a similar fashion as in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.161" offset="9385114">But the court, in the Kramer case, was making presumptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.248" offset="9413431">I think that the court, in the Kramer case, was making the same kind of presumptions that we had in the Stanley v. Illinois case, where we were going to decide... where Illinois decided that an unwed father was presumptively incapable of having or fathering or being the father of the child, and that he would have to seek his child in some other fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2353.370" offset="9537878">I think, in addition to looking at what may have been a classification, we have to look at what is the action taken by the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.181" offset="9613215">The action taken by the state court was a modification.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.735" offset="9631397">As counsel for the petitioner has pointed out, we can go back in and review this again and again, I guess from the time the child is age six till the child is age 18, but unless there is a showing, and I don't believe at this point in time that there's been a showing of either coercion or penalty, that the state action taken necessarily is anything other than what is permissible under the state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.771" offset="9759501">The Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing case indicates to us that if we're... if we're going to have an allegation of racial discrimination, that there has to be a showing of intent and purpose in the racial discrimination or classification that I don't believe has been shown in this particular case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2443.277" offset="9897532">I think one of the elements necessary to show an impermissible classification lacks in that instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2450.081" offset="9924804">The other alternative view could be that the classification is suspect, but all of the custody cases seem to take that type of classification or racial classification out of the suspect nature and place them in a framework of rational relationship between the classification authorities.</text>
            <text syncTime="2482.485" offset="10054371">Finally, again looking at the Kramer case and quoting from it:</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.575" offset="10086763">"It is best said, just as no assumptions are automatically warranted based on gender of parent or child, we believe no assumptions are automatically warranted by racial identify. "</text>
