            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="147484">Now we will hear arguments this morning in Clark against Community for Creative Non-Violence.</text>
            <text syncTime="10.340" offset="188757">Mr. Bator.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="paul_m_bator" startTime="12.136" stopTime="254.212">
            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="12.136" offset="195967">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.119" offset="207879">This case involves the use and the regulation of Lafayette Park and the Mall.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.038" offset="235569">I need hardly belabor the point, therefore, that this case is about places that are very, very special, places that mean something to every American and that really do belong to every American.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.299" offset="288650">They are places that are intensely used for all kinds of activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.078" offset="311742">They are very grand and beautiful, and thousands come in a spirit of awe and reverence.</text>
            <text syncTime="46.858" offset="334834">But it's also the case that thousands come just to jog and to picnic and to play softball.</text>
            <text syncTime="53.400" offset="361061">These places are also much used, and fittingly used, for political demonstrations.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.336" offset="388751">They are intensely used for that purpose.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.115" offset="399931">The Park Service statistics indicate that somewhere between 900 and 1,000 permits are sought a year for special events and demonstrations in the memorial core area.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.142" offset="444026">So that on any given day there will be an average of three or so demonstrations going on.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.875" offset="466909">The case is fundamentally about what sorts of parks these are to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.606" offset="489897">The specific question in the case is whether the National Park Service has the authority to enforce a flat general rule that provides that nobody may spend the night camping in Lafayette Park and the Mall.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.008" offset="543500">You may not use these places as overnight sleeping accommodations.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.880" offset="562935">Respondents are here arguing that the Constitution gives them the constitutional right to use these places as overnight sleeping accommodations.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.236" offset="608388">They say that the use of these parks overnight for sleep is speech within the meaning of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.327" offset="636705">The regulation involved in the case is not in terms directed at speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.403" offset="661051">It does not on its face even have the effect of limiting expression.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.465" offset="677247">The regulation simply prohibits camping, and camping is defined in the common sense way of use of the parks for living accommodation purposes, including the constituent activity of sleeping overnight in tents.</text>
            <text syncTime="147.317" offset="736702">Now, Respondents asked for a permit to conduct a demonstration in Lafayette Park and the Mall.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.690" offset="762197">It's common ground that the purpose of the demonstration was sincere, important and serious, to demonstrate the tragic plight of homeless people.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.107" offset="807860">To do this, the Respondents sought a permit to erect 60 tents in Lafayette Park and the Mall, and there would be 150 people demonstrating there for a period of three months, during which the 150 people would be spending the nights asleep in tents in Lafayette Park and the Mall.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.270" offset="888526">The Park Service granted the Respondents a wide-ranging permit to demonstrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.862" offset="914857">Nobody tried to prevent the Respondents from exercising their right to speak, to assemble, to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.921" offset="955086">Respondents were told they could come to Lafayette Park, they could speak in every normal sense of that term as freely as they wished, they could maintain a continuous round-the-clock presence, maintain an all-night vigil.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.993" offset="1011406">They could assemble and parade and leaflet.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.241" offset="1028437">They could use symbols and signs.</text>
            <text syncTime="222.319" offset="1036692">They could even erect symbolic structures and tents in order to convey the message of homelessness.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.284" offset="1064591">But they were also told that they may not use the park overnight to sleep, and this lawsuit tests the validity of that application of the regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="239.843" offset="1106805">The Government is here because the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia held in a six to five ruling that the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech applies to the sleeping activity proposed by the demonstrators.</text>

            <text syncTime="254.212" offset="1164274">May I ask a couple of preliminary questions, Mr. Bator.</text>
            <text syncTime="258.382" offset="1180993">The Respondents indicate that other demonstrators have been given permits by the Park Service to sleep overnight in the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.924" offset="1227177">Is there any question about the validity of that statement?</text>

            <label>Mr. Paul M. Bator</label>
            <text syncTime="275.891" offset="1251001">Your Honor, the district court found explicitly, on the basis of a record that I think substantially supports that finding, that there has been no discrimination in the application of this demonstration; that in fact the Park Service has across the board tried conscientiously to enforce the regulation against sleeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="300.209" offset="1348281">It is the case that for a period of three months, under a previous judgment of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, that court held that the regulations in fact permit certain kinds of sleeping.</text>
            <text syncTime="311.344" offset="1392793">The Government then proceeded forthwith to amend the regulations.</text>

            <text syncTime="1127.296" offset="4656637">I'd like to turn to another problem with the contrary view here, which is the question, if you ever permit it when do you permit it?</text>
            <text syncTime="1136.247" offset="4692372">One of the very important concerns of the Government here is that if this regulation can't be applied on an across the board basis we get into a very difficult, case by case review of the question whether the particular demonstration does or does not include as an important expressive feature the business of sleeping at night in Lafayette Park and the Mall.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.892" offset="4798952">And we believe that that inevitably turns basically into content-oriented licensing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1168.905" offset="4823089">That is, if you adopt the rule that in certain cases an exception has to be made, that really is the regime that the Respondents ask for here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.306" offset="4872617">They agree that the regulation is valid on its face.</text>
            <text syncTime="1184.993" offset="4887455">They agree that usually people can be prevented from camping on the park.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.770" offset="4910547">But they say that exceptions must be made.</text>
            <text syncTime="1193.035" offset="4919533">Exceptions for whom?</text>
            <text syncTime="1194.613" offset="4925907">Well, there's the rub.</text>
            <text syncTime="1195.956" offset="4931236">They say exceptions for us, for other people similarly situated.</text>
            <text syncTime="1200.486" offset="4949417">But in all the history of this case nobody has been able to come up with an understandable rule that says when sleeping in the park is or is not an important speech activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.138" offset="4999990">And it seems quite plain to the Government that therefore what this comes to is case by case licensing by the agency, and eventually by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1222.681" offset="5038129">And it's licensing that will be uncomfortably content-oriented.</text>
            <text syncTime="1227.069" offset="5055683">I mean, this case is really an ironic illustration, Your Honor, of the fact.</text>
            <text syncTime="1232.396" offset="5076999">In this case, the Respondents and the Government are engaged in a detailed disputation before this Court on whether sleeping is or is not important for conveying the message of homelessness.</text>

            <text syncTime="2594.878" offset="10526978">And the notion of people sleeping in the midst of winter without adequate shelter, without amenities, without food, without the storage of belongings, without any of the accoutrements of camping, solely to make that point is the significance of this particular demonstration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2614.167" offset="10604091">And the reason why these rules are so important and the reason why they are so different is that no society has attempted to reach out to the disadvantaged the way this society has, to provide them with a mechanism for entering into the public debate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2631.490" offset="10673368">The First Amendment, were it confined solely to verbal activity, were it confined solely to the classic means of expression, would be a means of communication that was open to the comfortable and the highly educated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2644.233" offset="10724359">And what is extraordinary about our law and what allows us to defend it against criticisms that the First Amendment is really a repressive technique is that this Court in two lines of opinions has recognized first that non-verbal expressive activity is worthy of First Amendment protection, and secondly... and this is a very important point, Justice Rehnquist, in answer to your first question... that the free public spaces of the nation, the parks and the sidewalks, are legitimate places for the exercise of First Amendment activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2678.078" offset="10859778">And when you put together those two lines of cases, the notion that you can engage in non-verbal expression and the notion that you can do so in the free public spaces of the nation, you have put together a mechanism that allows every segment of American society to speak.</text>

            <text syncTime="2913.969" offset="11803321">Or alternatively... and this is what I understand the facts to be... it may be that unless they're allowed to sleep they really won't come, a significant number of people will not be there.</text>
