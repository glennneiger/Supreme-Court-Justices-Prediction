            <label>Mr. Jay R. Moskowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="78.100" offset="446908">Thank you, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.116" offset="450983">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="82.552" offset="464776">We are here today in another in a line of cases following this Court's decision in North Carolina v. Pearce in 1969 dealing with under what circumstances may a trial judge impose a harsher sentence following retrial and reconviction after a first conviction has been reversed on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.167" offset="559235">In Pearce this Court announced that double jeopardy does not absolutely bar an enhancement of sentence, but the Court also announced in Pearce that due process requires that when a judge chooses to enhance following a second conviction that vindictiveness on his part must play no part in that enhancement, and further that because a defendant may be fearful when decided whether to take an appeal or not that if he does and gets a new trial the sentence may be enhanced because the judge is vindictive against him, that the apprehension on the part of the defendant should be taken away.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.798" offset="745749">In order to effectuate those two goals set out in Pearce, this Court set out a prophylactic rule that: one, on resentencing the District judge, the trial judge, must announce on the record his reasons for enhancing the sentence; and, two, that those reasons must be based on objective information of identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant, that conduct occurring subsequent to the first sentencing procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.458" offset="904364">In the case at hand on these facts the defendant's sentence following his second trial and conviction was enhanced not on any conduct that he did, but on an intervening act, that is, a conviction on preexisting conduct that occurred between the first and second sentencing hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.205" offset="995375">I think that in order to best understand the issue I should set out now on a fairly detailed analysis of the procedural process of the two convictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="226.279" offset="1039679">In 1978, Milton Wasman was indicted in two separate indictments, one dealing with the obtaining of a passport using a false name, and the second indictment charging him with several counts of mail fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.741" offset="1105507">In September of 1979 the passport case came up for trial and he was found guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.914" offset="1138212">At the sentencing hearing after that first trial, the judge, Judge Roettger, said that he was... he knew about the other indictment but he was not going to consider the pending indictment in passing sentence upon Wasman, and passed sentence, sentencing him to six months in jail.</text>

            <text syncTime="288.587" offset="1288887">His counsel at the time made a comment about the fact that he wasn't involved in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.007" offset="1314591">There was some procedural arguing back and forth, discussing back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.145" offset="1327130">Then Judge Roettger made the pronouncement that he was not going to be considering it because he doesn't consider pending indictments.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.881" offset="1354088">He thinks it's unfair to the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.266" offset="1371643">It... certainly Judge Roettger's comment was in response to a colloquy back and forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.920" offset="1394212">Whether or not there was a specific request don't consider it, it's unclear.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.308" offset="1411767">But he certainly did not consider it and the defendant certainly had no objection to him not considering it.</text>

            <text syncTime="420.757" offset="1817605">I think that, and I've been asked this question many times in the Eleventh Circuit and other places, the difficulty there is, and what the Eleventh Circuit addressed was, that the defendant is somehow trying to, if you will, according to the Eleventh Circuit language, have his cake and eat it too.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.651" offset="1893151">He asks back then, hey, don't consider this pending charge, and now he says you can't consider it.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.157" offset="1923140">The conduct predated my first sentencing, and if you wanted to consider it you should have done it back then.</text>
            <text syncTime="452.145" offset="1943097">That's the argument that I've been faced a number of times.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.930" offset="1958248">I think that the problem with that argument, and I'm taking it a little bit out of order now, but I'll address it now, the problem with that argument is that the argument forgets there is another judge waiting in the wings fully able to take that into account, in this case, and that if you will allow me to just develop the facts a little further I'll show you that Judge Davis, the judge in the, what was the mail fraud case and what ended up being a misdemeanor case, did have the opportunity to sentence Wasman on those facts, and in fact Judge Davis announced at the time of sentencing, considered the other case, the Judge Roettger case.</text>

            <text syncTime="510.315" offset="2175796">If the judge who is sentencing the person for the substantive conviction takes the substantive conviction into account, then another judge before whom he is found guilty of another charge can't take into account the alternate substantive conviction because he's already been sentenced on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1435.017" offset="5874630">The second time I'm saying that the... and, of course, that's basically what we're here for, because I think that there is a split in the circuits as to how to interpret the language "subsequent conduct" as written in Pearce, because the Second and Ninth Circuit interprets the language that if the conduct... if the, let's not use the word "conduct"... if the action of the defendant, if he does something and what he does predates the first sentencing, then, and the judge doesn't consider it, then it's out for all times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1473.659" offset="6029171">That's what the language of the... that's the interpretation given to the subsequent conduct language in Pearce, given by the Second Circuit in the Markus case, and the Ninth Circuit in the Williams case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1485.299" offset="6075773">The Eleventh Circuit in Wasman chose to read Pearce and conduct differently, and I would venture to say I believe that's why we're in this courtroom today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1497.959" offset="6126346">I read Pearce in a line along with the Second and Ninth Circuits, for the reason that I think that the Pearce test was formulated to take this fear of vindictiveness out of the mind of the defendant and to allow the defendant when he chooses to appeal or not to know that the ball is in his lap.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.907" offset="6222164">In this case, taking a look at the facts in this case, all that Wasman essentially did between the time of the first and second sentencing hearings was go home, fold his hands and sit there for a year and a half or two years, except one day go to court and have the mail fraud case reduced to a misdemeanor and have him enter a plea of nolo contendere for that charge, and be sentenced.</text>

            <text syncTime="1767.466" offset="7204368">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1772.870" offset="7225997">I don't want to belabor this discussion that has gone on quite a bit already about the nature of taking into account the intervening conviction here, but I would like to say two things about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1788.879" offset="7290049">The main thing, I think, is that this is all quite beside the point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.414" offset="7304155">Petitioner has made a lot of whether Judge Roettger really gave an appropriate sentence here because Judge Davis had already taken things into account, the matter was already before Judge Davis, Mr. Wasman is an old man.</text>
            <text syncTime="1805.091" offset="7354937">The question for the Court is not to review the appropriateness of Judge Roettger's sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1811.661" offset="7381164">This is a constitutional case, and the only question is whether the due process clause was violated by the increase of the sentence after retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.017" offset="7414601">I'd like to begin by talking a little bit about the factual background here because I think the statements that were made in the record at the two sentencing proceedings pretty clearly indicate that there was no conceivable process violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1833.741" offset="7469458">At the first sentencing hearing the government called the court's attention to this pending indictment on the mail fraud charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1841.180" offset="7499238">I think it's quite clear there that the defense counsel asked the court not to take that into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.168" offset="7527241">This is on page 26 of the Joint Appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1851.720" offset="7541452">He explained that Mr. Wasman had never had an opportunity to tell his story and connects him with the mail fraud charges, and then he said, I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="1860.976" offset="7578441">"I respectfully suggest it's not appropriate for the government to be arguing that Mr. Wasman's entitled to some sort of enhanced punishment in this passport case by virtue of the mail fraud indictment. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1871.883" offset="7622118">Judge Was... excuse me, Judge Roettger agreed with that and said it was his general policy not to take pending charges into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="1880.905" offset="7658167">He also said, and again I quote from the same page:</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.091" offset="7670915">"My theory of sentencing is simply that one can consider prior convictions and judges not only may but should consider prior convictions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1893.030" offset="7706650">At that point he sentenced petitioner under the split sentence provision of 18 USC 3561 to two years imprisonment, with all but six months of that sentence suspended in favor of three years' probation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1908.372" offset="7767986">After petitioner succeeded in getting his conviction reversed on appeal, he came back for resentencing after his second conviction before Judge Roettger.</text>
            <text syncTime="1919.228" offset="7811453">And at that time, of course, a conviction had been entered on the misdemeanor that arose out of the mail fraud charges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1924.716" offset="7833396">At that hearing Judge Roettger focused on this intervening conviction and made it clear that that was his reason for changing the sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.322" offset="7863803">He said... this is at page A42 of the appendix to the petition:</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.392" offset="7884074">"At that time he came before me with two convictions. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1940.594" offset="7896926">"The last time he came before me with one conviction. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1943.880" offset="7910092">And the court explained that it considered the conviction to which Mr. Wasman had pled during the intervening time to be a more serious offense and that it warranted a higher sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1954.485" offset="7952515">At this time he sentenced him to two years imprisonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1958.555" offset="7968710">And as we pointed out in our brief, because of the provisions of 18 USC 3651 he could not have simply sentenced him to eight months imprisonment, impose the same split sentence that he had before, just increasing the imprisonment time a little bit, because 3651 has a six-month maximum on the amount of imprisonment time that may be imposed where there's a split sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.671" offset="8069230">We suggest that nothing in this history suggests anything more than the normal sentencing decisions by a judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.210" offset="8099427">On its face there's no hint of a violation of the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.478" offset="8112488">Petitioner's claim that there is a due process violation rests entirely on North Carolina v. Pearce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2001.132" offset="8139029">Pearce did recognize a due process limitation on resentencing after appeal, but it certainly did not impose an absolute ban on a higher sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2011.774" offset="8181661">Quite the contrary, the Court explicitly stated there at page 723 that a trial judge is not constitutionally precluded from imposing a higher sentence after a retrial in light of events subsequent to the first trial which shed new light on the sentencing decision.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="2031.001" offset="8258565">Well, I was going to get to that a little bit later, but there are two separate statements in Pearce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2036.572" offset="8280821">Once the Court uses the term "events" subsequent to the first trial, and at a later point it refers to conduct on behalf of the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.911" offset="8310183">So there is certainly some ambiguity as to exactly what the Court meant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2048.947" offset="8330350">What Pearce did hold is that it violates due process to impose a greater sentence in retaliation for the defendant's exercise of his right to appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2060.921" offset="8378206">To protect against the realistic possibility of such a vindictive motivation, whether conscious or, more likely, a subconscious motivation, and to avoid unfairly chilling the right to appeal by assuring defendants that such vindictive resentencing will not be allowed, the Court in Pearce set for a prophylactic rule prohibiting such a sentence increase unless justified by specific reasons placed on the record by the sentencing judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.774" offset="8493667">Now it's clear beyond doubt from Pearce and from the other due process cases that have followed it that the concern there is with preventing actual vindictiveness, in this context an increased sentence that is imposed actually in retaliation for the taking of an appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2108.687" offset="8569318">This danger arises because of the human element that is involved in resentencing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2115.091" offset="8594918">It is possible and difficult to determine from the record that a judge will in fact harbor some vindictive motivation, perhaps subconsciously.</text>
            <text syncTime="2122.828" offset="8625847">If sentences were imposed by machines under some formula, there would be no need for the North Carolina v. Pearce rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.434" offset="8660224">And in fact the Court held that in kind of an analogous situation in Chaffin v. Stynchcombe, where the sentence the second time around was to be imposed by a jury that did not know what the first sentence was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.527" offset="8712678">There the Court realized there was no possibility that the jury would have a vindictive motivation, not even knowing what the first sentence was, and it held that the Pearce rule did not apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.466" offset="8752384">Now--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="2155.699" stopTime="2174.880">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="2155.699" offset="8757295">Even though the... after that decision defendants might have a realistic fear of being sentenced to a longer sentence after appeal.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="alan_i_horowitz" startTime="2174.880" stopTime="2548.906">
            <label>Mr. Alan I. Horowitz</label>
            <text syncTime="2174.880" offset="8834095">--That's right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.913" offset="8838170">So the so-called chilling effect that Pearce is concerned with is an unfair chilling effect that defendants may be worried that they're going to get an unfair higher sentence later, a vindictive higher sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.521" offset="8884668">But there is nothing unfair about them taking the risk of getting a valid higher sentence later, and Pearce and the due process clause does not protect against that possibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.245" offset="8923538">I won't read it again here, but I think this is stated quite clearly by the Court in Chaffin at page 25 and the three printed pages 16 to 17 of our brief, the fact that in Pearce the possibility of a higher sentence was recognized and accepted as as legitimate concomitant of the retrial process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.290" offset="8999711">Thus, when a sentence is increased for valid, non-vindictive reasons, no Pearce problem is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.444" offset="9028341">As the Court explained in Goodwin, the rule of Pearce simply imposes a presumption of vindictiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2231.816" offset="9061778">This alleviates the practical difficulty of proving motivation for the defendant, but it is not an absolute rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2239.155" offset="9091140">When the circumstances of a particular case clearly dispel the realistic possibility of vindictiveness by demonstrating a valid reason for the increase, there should be no bar to the imposition of a higher sentence on retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2252.980" offset="9146415">Now petitioner's contention here is that the only reason that can validly be used to impose a higher sentence on retrial is one that is based on conduct on the part of the defendant that occurs subsequent to the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2269.758" offset="9213602">Now putting aside for one moment what the opinion in Pearce has to say about that, I would like to point out that there's been no explanation as to why the due process clause should require such a rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.665" offset="9261145">I think as we fully explained our brief this sort of distinction simply makes no sense with respect to the policies that underlie Pearce and the overall thrust of the decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.540" offset="9308688">If this sort of distinction does apply, it would have quite undesirable consequences in the sentencing process without advancing the policies of the due process clause one iota.</text>
            <text syncTime="2305.246" offset="9355499">And I'd like to give a few examples of that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2308.550" offset="9368769">One is the example that is given in this case, where there is an intervening conviction... excuse me... after the first sentence was imposed by the judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="2320.357" offset="9415999">Now he has additional information before him that suggests that a defendant perhaps deserves a higher sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2325.725" offset="9437419">Under the rule suggested by petitioner, the judge is not allowed to take this into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="2334.265" offset="9471587">This is highlighted in this case and perhaps more egregiously in the Williams case in the Ninth Circuit, if you look at the facts of that case, a case where the Court found the conduct language in Pearce to be controlling.</text>
            <text syncTime="2347.341" offset="9523937">The Court was unable on the resentencing to take into account what I believe was a murder, state murder conviction that occurred later.</text>
            <text syncTime="2355.530" offset="9556642">Another example is the hypothetical suggested by Justice White, where in fact nothing happens after the first trial, but more information comes to light that wasn't available the first time around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.688" offset="9609305">Then we learn that the defendant has quite a long rap sheet and really is a much more serious offender than was thought before.</text>
            <text syncTime="2375.758" offset="9637517">And finally I think an important situation to be taken into account and one that has come before this Court before in Michigan v. Payne... the case where the defendant pleads guilty and is sentenced on the basis of a guilty plea.</text>
            <text syncTime="2391.537" offset="9700733">The Court has recognized many times that judges usually impose leniency when a guilty plea is entered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.040" offset="9726647">Now sometimes the defendant may collaterally attack the validity of his guilty plea and ultimately go to trial a second time if he succeeds in that attack.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.831" offset="9769906">Now it just simply doesn't make any sense that the judge should be restricted to the sentence that he imposed the first time, the lenient sentence that he imposed on the basis of the guilty plea, when the defendant ends up going to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.139" offset="9819120">Now to digress for a moment as to exactly what the opinion in Pearce says, I think there are three different basic kinds of situations here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.446" offset="9864364">One is where there's actual conduct, bad acts, by the defendant after the first trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.784" offset="9893621">The petitioner himself agrees that a higher sentence on retrial would be permissible if based on such conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.623" offset="9925073">The second class is where some event takes place after trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.444" offset="9948270">That would be this case, I believe, where the conviction has been entered but in fact there was no bad act committed by the defendant during that time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2462.633" offset="9985050">It's our position, as we explain in our brief, that the Court in Pearce contemplated that an event such as that, such as the one in this case, would equally be permissible to be used by the judge as a basis for increasing the sentence at the second trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.761" offset="10053595">Petitioner disagrees with that and focuses only on this one isolated statement at the end of the opinion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.331" offset="10079822">But, as I say, our position is that everything in Pearce is fully consistent with affirming the Court of Appeals here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2492.335" offset="10103855">Now there is a third class of cases, the hypothetical suggested by Justice White, where there's really no event after the first trial ends, but there is new information that comes to light that would seem to justify a higher sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2509.797" offset="10173759">Now in our view such information should also be grounds for imposing a higher sentence if it in fact justifies the higher sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2521.254" offset="10219525">I think a reading of the opinion in Pearce suggests that in fact the Court did not contemplate that such information would be available and we suggested in our brief that that is dictum and that the Court ought to reconsider it here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.848" offset="10285876">We're not really asking the Court to come up with a rule one way or the other, but more or less to back away from what it said before and leave these kind of questions to be decided by the lower courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="2668.868" offset="10809997">A couple of comments, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2670.451" offset="10816371">Not to belabor the point, but I think that Pearce talks not just of actual vindictiveness.</text>
            <text syncTime="2682.242" offset="10863496">It also talks about a defendant's state of mind following his first conviction, a state of mind at the time when he has to make a determination as to whether he should take--</text>
            <text syncTime="2696.835" offset="10921906">Pearce says, Pearce states and in Blackledge v. Perry it's expounded upon, that fear of vindictiveness is as important as removing vindictiveness itself, and that it is not always possible and not always required that a defendant actually prove vindictiveness in order to succeed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2725.604" offset="11036949">One of the things... Mr. Horowitz laid out certain hypotheticals and one I just want to let the Court know that I'm in complete agreement with, and that is his guilty plea situation, that a man enters a guilty plea, withdraws it, then goes to trial and is convicted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2743.733" offset="11109465">In-between the time of his first sentencing on the guilty plea and the second sentencing on the conviction, something else happens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.605" offset="11144991">I find the guilty plea situation withdrawn or overturned on some kind of an appeal to be nothing more than the withdrawal of a plea bargain, and certainly a judge who may have been lenient the first time around can give whatever sentence the judge thinks appropriate the second time around.</text>
            <text syncTime="2775.637" offset="11237047">That really, I don't think, falls within the line that I've been arguing.</text>
            <text syncTime="2780.858" offset="11257945">Mr. Horowitz also commented about on the Ninth Circuit case the Williams case about the man convict... the man who was... the intervening act was a murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="2793.416" offset="11308204">I am not here standing here saying that my client or that Williams or that Markus or anybody else should escape punishment on the murder, on the misdemeanor false certificates case or any other case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2809.175" offset="11371212">I'm just saying that under the guidance and guidelines of Pearce the punishment should not be enhanced based on previous conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2819.316" offset="11411754">It seems that we're really talking here about a fortuitous event in the Wasman situation, the fortuitous event being that Wasman resolved the mail fraud case prior to the second trial and second conviction in the passport case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.633" offset="11517079">Had the mail fraud case, which was resolved in a negotiated settlement, have occurred subsequent to the retrial and reconviction in the passport case, we obviously would not be standing here today, because Judge Roettger obviously could not have and would not have taken it into account the second time around.</text>
