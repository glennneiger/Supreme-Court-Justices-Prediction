            <text syncTime="6.388" offset="173535">Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="rex_e_lee" startTime="11.262" stopTime="282.903">
            <label>Mr. Rex E. Lee</label>
            <text syncTime="11.262" offset="193074">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, before I state the facts of this case, I would like first just briefly briefly to review the governing principle of law against whose background the statement of facts should be more helpful.</text>
            <text syncTime="26.616" offset="254410">The exclusionary rule emerged from cases like Weeks versus the United States and Mapp v. Ohio in which law enforcement officers committed flagrantly abusive violations of the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.515" offset="318044">The officers knew or should have known that what they were doing was a violation of the Fourth Amendment but they did it anyway.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.230" offset="348868">The rule rests on the assumption that the best way to deter that kind of conduct is to deny its evidentiary fruits to the law enforcement officers who perpetrated it.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.352" offset="397352">Neither the exclusionary rule nor its underlying deterrence assumption is being challenged in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="70.520" offset="430057">Its applicability to cases of wilful misconduct, like Weeks and Mapp, would be left undisturbed by the rule which we propose.</text>
            <text syncTime="79.844" offset="467360">The net result of Weeks and Mapp is that we are willing to let some criminals go free as the necessary price for deterring the constable from violating the Fourth Amendment, but it is a heavy price, and this Court has clarified that it is a heavy price, and that we do not pay it beyond those cases to which its underlying deterrence rationale extends.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.131" offset="576552">The exception for which we contend comes into play by its very definition only in those cases where deterrence would be inappropriate, where the police have acted as a reasonably well trained officer would have acted under the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.012" offset="656068">In that kind of case, to whatever extent, excluding the evidence, where the police have acted reasonably deters, it deters too much.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.476" offset="705910">It overdeters.</text>
            <text syncTime="140.383" offset="709567">It is just as likely to deter the police from performing their duty as it is to encourage compliance with the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="148.583" offset="742272">Therefore, it will not deter future Fourth Amendment violations so long as the police do their duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.281" offset="781143">This Court's precedents make it very clear that since the paramount and perhaps the sole purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter, the rule applies only to those situations where the deterrence benefits outweigh the costs of depressing highly probative evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.633" offset="862540">In Stone v. Powell and United States v. Janis, for example, it was conceded that there would have been some additional evidence, some additional deterrence from the unavailability of the illegally seized evidence at a subsequent habeas corpus proceeding or a civil trial by a different sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.155" offset="940594">In both of those cases and others, the existence of some marginal deterrence from application of the exclusionary rule to those additional proceedings or to those additional contexts was conceded.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.681" offset="990749">Nevertheless, the rule was held inapplicable because it could not pay its way in a cost benefit analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.570" offset="1018230">The marginal evidentiary cost exceeded the marginal deterrence benefit that would result from applying an exclusionary rule to those proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="230.316" offset="1069221">And it is this Court's deterrence-based cost benefit principle which squarely governs this case, to whose facts I now turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.233" offset="1108927">On the cost side, the four respondents here have been charged with offenses that include the possession and distribution of drugs.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.432" offset="1145708">The evidence that they seek to exclude, large quantities of drugs and drug dealing paraphernalia found in their residences, is highly relevant to the issue of their guilt or innocence.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.288" offset="1193146">On the deterrence side, it is really quite difficult to perceive just what it is that the police did wrong in this case, or perhaps more appropriately said, what it is that we would want them to do differently in the next case.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.656" offset="1266602">After receiving a tip from an informant that--</text>

            <text syncTime="282.903" offset="1279559">Well, on that basis... perhaps we just ought to reverse on that basis, that they acted consistently with the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="524.136" offset="2244522">We have characterized this informant under the usual standards as an informant of unproven reliability, the same as in Illinois versus Gates.</text>
            <text syncTime="533.600" offset="2282348">After receiving a tip from an informant that two of the respondents were selling drugs in large quantities, Officer Cyril Raumbach and other officers of the Burbank Police Department conducted a month-long investigation of two residences and a condominium, observed activities generally consistent with the informant's information, and conducted background checks on persons whom they observed.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.997" offset="2384016">Based on that information, on his years of experience as a narcotics officer, and on his specialized training in narcotics investigations, Officer Raumbach concluded that the condominium was being used as a distribution point, referred to as a stash pad, to store large quantities of narcotics which were then transported in smaller amounts to respondents' residences for distribution.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.235" offset="2492895">After consulting with three other experienced investigators and three deputy district attorneys, he applied for a search warrant, which was issued by a California Superior Court judge.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.528" offset="2538139">Now, as I say, whether the magistrate's judgment in this case correctly assessed the presence of probable cause is not before the Court, but whether the totality of those circumstances did or did not amount to probable cause, it certainly could not be said that it should have been clear to Officer Raumbach that there was no probable cause or that applying for a warrant would be improper in the circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.124" offset="2660496">He prepared his affidavit, and presented it to a magistrate, so that the decision whether to search or not to search was made as this Court has stated so frequently that it should be made, by a judicial officer, in this case a judge, rather than an executive officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="646.289" offset="2733117">I would invite the Court's attention to Officer Raumbach's detailed, carefully prepared 18-page affidavit, Pages 34 to 52 of the Joint Appendix, which shows that the constable in this case was a cautious, highly trained, and experienced narcotics expert who brought his experience and training to bear on his decision to apply for the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.435" offset="2829770">One of the strengths of the rule we propose is that it encourages that kind of high quality police work.</text>

            <text syncTime="1015.298" offset="4209139">Well, Mr. Lee, one of the arguments your opponents make to the adoption of a good faith exception to the exclusion rule is that it would prevent the development of Fourth Amendment law because the typical judge at a suppression hearing, faced with the question of, was there a Fourth Amendment violation, was it in good faith and reasonable, is going to answer the question, it was in good faith and reasonable, and so we don't have to get to the... Now, if you don't feel there is a lot of Fourth Amendment law that needs to be developed in view of the fact that there is only one sentence in the Constitution, that may not bother you much, but it seems to me that it does kind of go against your idea that magistrates' findings are somehow reviewable in some other forum, you know not where, is, I guess, what your answer is.</text>

            <text syncTime="1062.061" offset="4396281">Well, leave the magistrates aside, because I am really a bit uncertain as to what extent those would be reviewable or not, but the... or in exactly what context, but taking the issue that you have now raised, which is whether the adoption of reasonable belief exception would freeze the development of the Fourth Amendment law, I think it is a legitimate concern, and one that ought to be faced.</text>
            <text syncTime="1092.330" offset="4517280">On its face, however, I would note that it has to be taken in perspective, given the Court's consistent caution against the unnecessary resolution of constitutional issues, and that if the rule is otherwise appropriate for adoption, that certainly it is not a persuasive reason not to adopt it, because the consequence would be that this Court would have fewer opportunities to decide constitutional questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.676" offset="4642668">But to whatever extent it is a legitimate concern, and I start from the premise that it is, there are several avenues by which substantive Fourth Amendment issues will continue to come before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.609" offset="4690419">Three of those categories are discussed in our reply brief, and in the interest of time I will simply refer you to those categories that are discussed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.528" offset="4730126">But I would emphasize orally that in addition to those three specific categories, the Court is free to reach the substantive Fourth Amendment issue before it reaches the remedial issue in those cases where in the Court's judgment that perfectly logical ordering of issue consideration, namely, consideration first of whether there has been a substantive Fourth Amendment violation, and second, whether there has been a... whether the exclusionary rule should apply, involves only a prudential use of the Court's resources, and that is exactly what the Court has done in several analogous circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1188.322" offset="4901280">In the harmless error cases, for example, the Court has sometimes considered first whether a wrong was committed, and sometimes it has not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.740" offset="4938896">Those harmless error cases are discussed in our opening brief, both cases coming out of this Court and also out of the Courts of Appeals, and the respondents really have not had any response or any... they have not answered the persuasiveness of those harmless error cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.763" offset="5019040">And in O'Connor versus Donaldson, which was a civil damage suit, the Court first held that the respondent's confinement was unconstitutional, and then remanded the case to the Court of Appeals to consider the petitioner's claim of a good faith immunity defense in light of the intervening decision handed down the same term in Wood versus Strickland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1238.301" offset="5101169">Now, if there were an Article III constitutional limitation on reaching the substantive issue in a case in which the remedial issue might dispose of the case, you would have to overrule both the harmless error cases and also Wood versus Strickland.</text>
            <text syncTime="1258.122" offset="5180477">The question therefore concerns the requirements of judicial prudence and not of Article III--</text>

            <text syncTime="1310.867" offset="5391441">It is a question of judicial prudence, and not of Article III.</text>
            <text syncTime="1315.881" offset="5411503">In a case like this one, given Gates, it simply would not be prudent for this Court to review a fact bound probable cause determination.</text>
            <text syncTime="1324.408" offset="5445567">In other cases, it would be prudent for the Court to decide important, recurrent, and unsettled substantive Fourth Amendment questions prior to reaching the remedy issue, and nothing in the Constitution prevents it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1341.058" offset="5512232">The contrary assertion, really, on analysis, would require overruling this Court's harmless error cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.399" offset="5537623">Just one final point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1349.179" offset="5544728">It is very clear, I submit, that the respondents' position cannot withstand analysis under the deterrence-based cost benefit rationale that has been the foundation of this Court's exclusionary rule decisions for at least 15 years.</text>
            <text syncTime="1371.311" offset="5633231">The only rationale which would deny a reasonable good faith exception is one that would say that federal courts simply cannot consider evidence which has been tainted by an unlawful search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1386.852" offset="5695402">It would be a per se rule that the unlawful search always disqualifies the evidence, and that simply is not the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.286" offset="5725182">This Court's holdings in Alderman, Calandra, Janis, Stone v. Powell, Havens, and others show that the imperative of judicial integrity does not prevent the courts from considering all evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.669" offset="5794668">Indeed, I submit those cases establish that it is just as offensive to be imperative of judicial integrity that facts known to the judge, to the lawyers on both sides, and to the defendant, and to every participant in the courtroom except the participants who need that information in order to perform their duty is withheld only from those people who do need it in order to perform their job.</text>
            <text syncTime="1440.377" offset="5909502">And there is a larger sense in which the imperative of judicial integrity is involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.248" offset="5936983">We pay a price for technical rules that our citizens are unable to understand and respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1455.245" offset="5968957">We demean the Fourth Amendment when its values depends on things whose relevance the common citizen has a hard time understanding.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.101" offset="6016395">People can understand that some useful purpose is served when evidence obtained in flagrant violation of a defendant's rights is suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1477.424" offset="6057668">They have much more difficulty accepting the validity of suppression when it is done in response to a minor departure from rather technical and unclear requirements, or when the police have acted in reasonable good faith.</text>

            <text syncTime="1498.744" offset="6142932">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, the proposition advanced by petitioner in this case as well as being unconstitutional is unnecessary, unmanageable, and illogical.</text>
            <text syncTime="1516.082" offset="6212313">Its consequences, among other things, would include nullifying the primary purpose of the warrant clause, undermining the systemic deterrence rationale, abandoning the continued scrutiny of magistrates which in Gates was declared to be so essential, and would generate burdensome and cumbersome litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.931" offset="6315758">The foundation of petitioner's argument seems to rest on the proposition of how can you deter a police officer who is acting in objective good faith, or who is acting in good faith?</text>
            <text syncTime="1557.550" offset="6378139">This assumes that the officer is acting in subjective good faith, and we can avoid a subjective inquiry, but yet petitioner's standard or test proposes that it only be an objective test, and we do not explore the minds of police officers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2377.391" offset="9657551">In addition, the requirement of judicial integrity seems to require that the Court discourage, not encourage constitutional violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.040" offset="9720140">Now, how can a good faith exception possibly discourage constitutional violations?</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.021" offset="9752114">It will be, as Justice Stewart, former Justice Stewart mentioned in his article.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.987" offset="9787954">The focus will not be on the Fourth Amendment, but what violations will be condoned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2415.658" offset="9810628">The effects of the rule and the impact of the exclusionary rule have certainly been grossly exaggerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2427.121" offset="9856499">Now, I do not want to go through all of the studies which we have listed in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2432.338" offset="9877293">One part, though, becomes important.</text>
            <text syncTime="2436.181" offset="9892757">The centerpiece or a centerpiece of the Solicitor's brief is a quote from Justice White's Footnote 13 in Gates, where Justice White, observing the comments of the Solicitor as an amicus in Gates, Justice White then made the statement that 30 percent of all felony drug prosecutions in California are dismissed or are not prosecuted for search and seizure reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.512" offset="10009995">Now, this is quite simply a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2469.228" offset="10024937">Not only is it a mistake, it is exaggerated 14 times.</text>
            <text syncTime="2472.852" offset="10039357">In Davies' study of the California arrest proceedings, the actual rate in California is 2.3 percent of the drug arrests, not of all arrests, just drug arrests, 2.3 percent are not prosecuted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2490.174" offset="10108633">Of all arrests, it is only.8 percent are not prosecuted, and this is in a state where there is no standing requirement of any kind, where independent state grounds are urged all the time, and where we even have protections in our garbage cans sitting in front of our houses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2512.367" offset="10197450">This supposed good faith exception would abandon review of the magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2526.221" offset="10252829">It will not be the inferences drawn by the magistrates which will become the center of the hearings.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.485" offset="10277907">It will be the inferences drawn by the police officer, and obviously the Constitution should encourage and this Court should encourage the use of warrants, but it seems at the same time you must encourage maintaining the integrity of the warrant process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2550.211" offset="10348855">It is not just to encourage the use of a piece of paper, but to encourage a valid warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2555.084" offset="10368290">Good faith would provide for no meaningful review of magistrates' decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2561.426" offset="10393681">Justice Rehnquist recognized the need for continued review of magistrates' decisions in Gates, talked about the non-lawyer magistrate situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2573.312" offset="10441224">We outlined this in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="2575.655" offset="10450628">I don't know if at the time of Gates you were or were not aware of the extent of the problem, but there are over 10,000 magistrates in this country who are not lawyers, who can issue warrants, some without even high school educations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2589.806" offset="10507262">Many of these warrants are admissible in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2593.695" offset="10522726">All the evidence would be admissible in federal court in the event federal officers didn't participate in the search, but many of these magistrates can issue warrants under Rule 41.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.189" offset="10568702">The review of magistrates in the view of people who... of authorities, sources who have considered the problem does in fact deter the magistrates.</text>
            <text syncTime="2619.748" offset="10627007">It makes them more careful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2621.294" offset="10633172">This was the basis for U.S. versus Caranthos, where the Second Circuit rejected this same contention in 1976, and concluded that review plus the exclusionary rule induces magistrates to scrutinize warrants and avoids rubber stamps.</text>
            <text syncTime="2639.989" offset="10707987">This is the same opinion that former Justice Stewart reached.</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.612" offset="10722406">The good faith standard that the prosecutor, that the petitioner proposes is just simply unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2653.827" offset="10763262">In the words of Justice Powell, it would confound the confusion to try and apply that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2661.964" offset="10795863">Is it objective or is it subjective?</text>
            <text syncTime="2664.573" offset="10806312">It is easy to say, omit the subjective component.</text>
            <text syncTime="2668.556" offset="10822194">But that won't work because the premise of petitioner's argument is that the individual is acting in subjective good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="2675.803" offset="10851242">What is the standard for the reasonable police officer?</text>
            <text syncTime="2679.722" offset="10866916">For example, petitioner's brief, when we said, what do you do with a rural sheriff from Alaska, petitioner says, if the sheriff is testifying in New York City, the standard is the standard in New York City.</text>
            <text syncTime="2694.529" offset="10926057">And if that same sheriff were testifying apparently in the federal court in Alaska, we would have a totally different standard as to what the good faith rule requires.</text>
            <text syncTime="2704.479" offset="10965868">What do you do with a Whitley versus Warden situation, where a bad warrant which Justice White would say would not pass the good faith test was communicated to an officer over a telephone call or on a radio, and the officer never even saw the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.657" offset="11042563">Is that officer at the end of the phone acting reasonably, even though there is no probable cause?</text>
            <text syncTime="2729.390" offset="11065551">There are just simply layers and layers of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="2734.544" offset="11086135">If it is shown to a police officer, or to a U.S. attorney, is it a reasonable police officer, is it a reasonable U.S. attorney that we are talking about?</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.148" offset="11128558">Clearly, the cases have established... or history has established there is no meaningful alternative remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2752.475" offset="11157920">Civil suits don't work.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.331" offset="11165339">Injunctions don't work in the absence of municipal policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.096" offset="11188326">The government's argument, to say the least, is disingenuous in view of some of these bills that are pending in Congress which would strip away all the protections.</text>

            <text syncTime="2784.978" offset="11287905">Mr. Chief Justice, and Members of the Court, I would first like to start by answering Justice Rehnquist's question as to whether or not probable cause would be found under the Gates decision as to my clients, Mr. Sanchez and Ms. Stewart, who were the object of the tip.</text>
            <text syncTime="2800.017" offset="11348091">I would categorically say that probable cause would not be found, and that is the crux of what the problem is in the government's presentation, The government... In Gates, as you know, there was a tip for immediate action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2814.356" offset="11405456">I believe the tip came in, the letter came in on May 3rd, and by May 5th corroborative events had taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.899" offset="11431579">The Court in upholding the Gates decision relied on United States versus Draper, and as the Court knows in that case they were able to also predict immediately what the activities of Mr. Draper would do with uncanny accuracy, the same train station, the same clothes, et cetera, and things like that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2843.125" offset="11520499">In Gates, they were able to predict what Mr. Gates would do immediately and where Mrs. Gates would be found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.092" offset="11540352">The problem is our case is that the tip came in five months after the act, so that the police officers were armed with a stale tip that they went out to corroborate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2862.664" offset="11598658">There was no evidence of future corroboration.</text>
            <text syncTime="2865.179" offset="11608689">There was no evidence of immediate corroboration, as there was in Gates and as there was in Draper, yet the government would have us adopt a rule, have you adopt a rule that said even though under Gates there would be no... as under Gates, there would be no probable cause, there would be... it would be all right to admit the evidence in this matter solely based upon some kind of, I suppose, knee-jerk reaction that when a police officer finds a magistrate who has erred the evidence should come in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.292" offset="11729166">That can do nothing but denigrate that part of the Fourth Amendment which gives us as individuals of the citizenry the right to be protected in our home and in our cars and in our personal things from an unwarranted invasion by police officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2911.145" offset="11792591">I believe that deterrence is the sole rationale in a search warrant case that is conceptually flawed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.173" offset="11820699">The Fourth Amendment, like the entire Bill of Rights, exists to prohibit the government from using certain means to effect goals that the public believes are legitimate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.043" offset="11864166">There is no question that the public believes these goals are legitimate, but no matter how legitimate these goals are, and no matter how good the goals are, they cannot be done by means which are prohibited by the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2942.256" offset="11917038">Now, that, the lynch pin of the Fourth Amendment is probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2948.223" offset="11940862">There is the cost benefit analysis of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2952.909" offset="11959670">It is that part of the Fourth... it is that part of the amendment which gives the... which describes that particular time when the individual's right to be secure in their home must give way to society's collective good to promote the general welfare and control crime.</text>
            <text syncTime="2971.213" offset="12032813">Now, once a violation of the Fourth Amendment is found, then I believe that a remedy has to take place or else we have a statement of a right without any effective way of having a remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2987.785" offset="12099164">And what we have here is, we have a situation in which there is no question that a violation of the Fourth Amendment was found.</text>
            <text syncTime="2994.315" offset="12125286">There was no probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2996.625" offset="12134481">The government concedes there was no probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.547" offset="12146184">They do not even ask at any time that this case should be reviewed under the Gates theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="3004.856" offset="12167396">They concede, I suppose, that even under Gates there was no probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3008.746" offset="12182965">But yet they wish to say that because a magistrate erred, that part of the Fourth Amendment which keeps us secure in our home and secure in our rights as citizens under the Fourth Amendment should not occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.879" offset="12247539">I believe that again the cost benefit analysis that I indicate is proper when deciding the scope of who the Fourth Amendment may apply to as, for example, this Court did in the Standing cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3040.327" offset="12309293">But I do not believe that a cost benefit analysis is proper once a violation has been found.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.136" offset="12340535">And that is what we have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.744" offset="12347014">The exclusionary rule, I believe, as it stands, is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3060.568" offset="12390272">It should deter unconstitutional police activity, and the reasons that it may not in particular situations are invalid.</text>
            <text syncTime="3071.689" offset="12434785">We have heard statements that the police feel frustrated, and that they don't understand the opinions, and that they see our courts as nitpickers who are preventing them from doing what they should be doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.198" offset="12484731">Certainly sociological studies have indicated... I am referring particularly to Mr. Skolech and Mr. Goldstein's studies... that police feel as a group disassociated from the common society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3100.990" offset="12551918">They are seeing themselves as authority figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="3103.176" offset="12560695">They see themselves as individuals who are doing the correct thing and are stopped from doing it by decisions of this Court and other courts which prevent them from doing it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.391" offset="12601551">It is impossible to think, therefore, that they would be deterred by any internal police activity, especially if they think that they are acting in good faith.</text>
            <text syncTime="3124.027" offset="12644078">It therefore becomes incumbent upon the Court not to back down from the rule which is attempting to effectuate a goal which everyone believes is a correct goal, that is, to deter unconstitutional police behavior, but to have a rule which would be better communicated to the police, and also to set up training programs, which I suppose would include the police and understand their function in our society and their function vis-a-vis the Bill of Rights and the Constitution, so that they will not feel, as studies seem to indicate, disassociated from the rest of us when decisions go against them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3167.899" offset="12819621">Now, implicit in the government's position is that alternative remedies can effectuate the same thing that the exclusionary rule can do by... and there are such things as alternative remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.595" offset="12890361">As Justice Murphy pointed out, the very nature of alternative remedies implies that there are equal remedies that would effectuate the same things that we want the exclusionary rule to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.060" offset="12940202">In fact, that isn't true.</text>
            <text syncTime="3199.981" offset="12947935">As co-counsel has indicated, immunity and tort violations really are not very effective.</text>

            <text syncTime="3554.386" offset="14365548">So my inquiry is whether the exclusionary rule, the purpose of which is to deter conduct, would apply equally to a magistrate as to a police officer?</text>

            <text syncTime="3601.086" offset="14552375">It should not take that long, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3603.430" offset="14561675">First, with respect to magistrate shopping, the argument is nothing more nor less than an attack on the warrant Procedure itself and on this Court's consistent advice that it has given over the years that the decision of whether to search or not after the police have done their job should not be done by the police preferably, but it should be a decision that should be made by a neutral judicial officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.838" offset="14691347">Nothing has happened in the interim to change the propriety or the correctness of that advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3642.804" offset="14719246">There is a limit to the extent to which society's ills can be cured by excluding evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3649.551" offset="14746204">The advice that the Court has consistently given that warrants are the preferred method by which probable cause judgments should be made has not changed, and it would be ironic in the extreme now to base... now to reject an otherwise very sound principle on the ground that would be inconsistent with the consistent assumption that has been made by the Court that what the police should do is exactly what they did in this instance, after they have done all of their own careful work, to submit that judgment to a magistrate.</text>
            <text syncTime="3688.458" offset="14901789">Now, the final question is whether we really need this rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3693.267" offset="14921015">Given the deference to magistrates on the substantive Fourth Amendment issue after Illinois versus Gates, we think that we do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3706.091" offset="14972320">One of the reasons is that from a theoretical standpoint, at least, they are two completely separate issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3715.493" offset="15009936">This Court made that very clear in Illinois versus Gates, that one goes to the wrong, the other goes to the remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3722.599" offset="15038357">The problem here is with an exclusionary rule that simply does not make sense in the kind of case... in United States versus Leon, Massachusetts versus Shepherd, and some others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3739.623" offset="15106485">You do not correct that kind of inadequate theory by adjusting somewhere else, and particularly where that adjustment is to a substantive constitutional provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3752.666" offset="15158625">Now, from a practical standpoint, the Court reminded us in course that what it was doing in Gates was not requiring new law, but simply clarifying what had been the law all along.</text>
            <text syncTime="3769.486" offset="15225917">We had Jones and Ventresca.</text>
            <text syncTime="3772.704" offset="15238769">We are not certain to what extent the courts will be able to apply with any greater degree, or to what extent there will be a real difference between the Jones, Ventresca, Gates standard prior to Illinois versus Gates, and to what extent it will be different.</text>
            <text syncTime="3792.055" offset="15316196">But in any event, there is a conceptual difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3795.710" offset="15330824">Certainly, certainly there are cases to which the rule that should arise from United States versus Leon will apply, notwithstanding Illinois versus Gates, and the only real issue is how large the application of that rule would be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3812.845" offset="15399370">Under those circumstances, it is clearly appropriate that such a rule be declared to be the basis of the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3819.841" offset="15427373">Unless the Court has any further questions, Mr. Chief Justice, I have nothing else.</text>
