            <text syncTime="54.073" offset="352565">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="60.196" offset="377120">This case raises a unique issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.036" offset="388510">Does Public Law 280 authorize a state to absolutely bar actions against non-Indians by Indians if they arise on an Indian reservation?</text>
            <text syncTime="73.502" offset="430306">This matter is here on certiorari to review a decision of the North Dakota Supreme Court affirming the State District Court's dismissal of Petitioner's negligence and breach of contract action against Respondent Wold Engineering.</text>
            <text syncTime="90.793" offset="499478">The facts of the case are simple.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.510" offset="510345">Petitioner, a federally recognized Indian tribe known as the Three Affiliated Tribes, employed Wold Engineering to construct a water supply system on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in northwestern North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.457" offset="570113">The project known as the Four Bears Water Project was intended to provide a water supply from Lake Sakakawea to a portion of the reservation population.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.484" offset="610237">However, after completion of the project in 1977 defects were discovered in that system that prevented the accomplishment of that objective.</text>
            <text syncTime="128.198" offset="649107">Despite attempts at correction by Wold Engineering of the system Petitioner, Three Tribes, commenced their negligence and breach of contract action in the State District Court for the Northwestern Judicial District of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.645" offset="706890">At trial in 1982 Wold moved to dismiss the action on the grounds that the federal law prohibited state jurisdiction over the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.000" offset="760285">The trial court agreed on the grounds that the Three Tribes failed to consent to Public Law 280 civil jurisdiction over the reservation in favor of the state and on that ground dismissed Petitioner's action.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.369" offset="825800">On appeal to the Supreme Court of North Dakota the State Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal construing a state statute, Chapter 2719, which is included in our appendix to our brief, as evidencing the state legislature's intent to disclaim any jurisdiction over the matter until the Indians consented to Public Law 280 jurisdiction in the civil area.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.075" offset="940634">The court noted in the course of its decision which is in the appendix of the petition for cert that state judicial jurisdiction had extended to these actions against non-Indians by Indians prior to the enactment in 1963 of Chapter 2719.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.004" offset="1032376">On that basis the State Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the tribe's action against Wold Engineering.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.889" offset="1075844">Only two sections of Public Law 280 are involved in this matter, Section 6 and Section 7.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.230" offset="1113251">Under that jurisdictional classification scheme North Dakota is a so-called optional state and a disclaimer state meaning that under Section 7 it must take appropriate action to amend its state constitution to remove the federal disclaimer imposed in its admitting act, and secondly under Section 7 of Public Law 280 it must enact affirmative legislation assuming jurisdiction under Section 7.</text>

            <text syncTime="273.795" offset="1231534">Mr. Cross, I take it since you are appealing from the judgment of the highest court of the State of North Dakota it is your position that there is some federal constitutional principle or federal statute which that decision has violated.</text>

            <label>Mr. Raymond Cross</label>
            <text syncTime="296.912" offset="1324007">That is right, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.380" offset="1329858">We feel that the state court misconstrued Public Law 280 in holding that it prohibits state court jurisdiction over actions of this sort.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="310.077" stopTime="333.569">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="310.077" offset="1376670">Well, do you think the Supreme Court of North Dakota actually read Public Law 280 to reach that result?</text>
            <text syncTime="316.918" offset="1404046">I thought its opinion could just as well be construed to mean that the referendum in the early sixties had represented judgment by the people of South Dakota that they did not want their courts to exercise this kind of jurisdiction.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="raymond_cross" startTime="333.569" stopTime="391.482">
            <label>Mr. Raymond Cross</label>
            <text syncTime="333.569" offset="1470606">Your Honor Justice Rehnquist, the decision itself indicates plainly that the state court regarded judicial jurisdiction of the state as extending to these actions before the enactment of the state statute involved under the authority of Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.279" offset="1545421">The sole source of the authority reading it either as an authorization or as compelling the state legislature to take that action is the source of that disclaimer.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.664" offset="1610936">So taking a look at the state judicial history under the state constitution and under the course of state judicial declaration the state had judicial jurisdiction over these actions prior to that enactment.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.283" offset="1661405">That enactment was explicitly taken under Section 7 of Public Law 280 and consequently it concerns the question of federal interpretation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="391.482" stopTime="394.669">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="391.482" offset="1702260">But up to then it is all questions of state law is it not?</text>

          <turn speaker="raymond_cross" startTime="394.669" stopTime="397.167">
            <label>Mr. Raymond Cross</label>
            <text syncTime="394.669" offset="1715008">That is correct, Justice Rehnquist.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="397.167" stopTime="414.051">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="397.167" offset="1725039">This case is a curious one, is it not, because here the tribe is asserting jurisdiction in the state court and usually these cases come up here in just the reverse posture.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="raymond_cross" startTime="414.051" stopTime="453.082">
            <label>Mr. Raymond Cross</label>
            <text syncTime="414.051" offset="1792539">That is correct, Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.910" offset="1795987">It is a surprising case in the sense that the Indian people here are asserting the right as citizens the rights that they have in common with other members of the state to sue in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="435.980" offset="1880206">So the constitutional question that is at stake is that assume that Public Law 280 was lifted out of this context and that this action was taken solely as a matter of state law would that violate equal protection and due process rights of the Indian people involved.</text>

            <text syncTime="456.769" offset="1963380">Mr. Cross, I suppose that it would not be necessary to reach that if in fact we thought that Public Law 280 was the grounds on which the North Dakota court based its holding and we could I suppose give North Dakota another look at it.</text>

            <label>Mr. Raymond Cross</label>
            <text syncTime="476.932" offset="2044046">That is correct, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.666" offset="2050943">Our position is this is that the state statute is based on a misconstruction or on a construction of Public Law 280 and that raises a federal law question that is appropriate for resolution by this Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="494.285" offset="2113427">If a state court had jurisdiction over the tribe's cause of action here what about Wold's counter claim?</text>

            <label>Mr. Raymond Cross</label>
            <text syncTime="509.873" offset="2175808">Since the Plaintiff here is a tribe, the tribe according to decisions by this Court has sovereign immunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.398" offset="2217917">It may be provided for in contracts that that can be waived.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="528.583" offset="2250623">Well, do you think there would be waiver as a matter of law if the tribe decides to sue in the state court?</text>

          <turn speaker="raymond_cross" startTime="533.862" stopTime="565.365">
            <label>Mr. Raymond Cross</label>
            <text syncTime="533.862" offset="2271729">--Well, as a matter of law, Justice O'Connor, Wold Engineering can recover to the extent of a set off.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.249" offset="2309346">They claim a small amount of money is due them under the contract, some $4500.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.308" offset="2337558">That would be available to them as a set off against the tribe's claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.228" offset="2365248">The question of an affirmative counter claim or claims that might arise present a tougher question.</text>

            <label>Mr. Raymond Cross</label>
            <text syncTime="597.758" offset="2527312">Your Honor, based on the state court decision below they did not differentiate between claims by tribal members or claims by tribes.</text>
            <text syncTime="606.661" offset="2562943">Based on their reading both of the state law and of Public Law 280 they did not make a distinction in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.860" offset="2595752">If there were a distinction to be made I think that would have to be made by the court below on remand, but here in the decision they made no distinction between the rights of the tribe to sue in state court nor am I certain they could but in fact they did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="632.774" offset="2667432">The state court decision below established a simple proposition: either the Indian tribes consent to Public Law 280 civil jurisdiction or they are barred from suing non-Indians in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.174" offset="2745068">Public Law 280 has been enacted for over 30 years now, and the decisions by this Court make clear that there is no legal or factual connection between suits against non-Indians and Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.918" offset="2812046">It is possible to give quite a full account of what the meaning both in the plain terms and the legislative history of Public Law 280 is in the light of recent decisions by this Court most notably Kennerly v. District Court, Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation and Bryan v. Ithasca County.</text>

            <text syncTime="698.249" offset="2929284">That is correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.872" offset="2935762">Now in the course of those decisions that I mentioned this Court has construed the application of Public Law 280 in a variety of contexts, in cases of non-P.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.197" offset="2985081">L. 280 in McClanahan v. Arizona State Tax Commisson, in cases where the states assumed full P.L. 280 jurisdiction in Bryan v. Ithasca County and in cases where the state has assumed partial jurisdiction in Washington v. Yakima Indian Nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.986" offset="3056239">In each of those cases this Court has construed the plain terms and the legislative intent of Public Law 280 as being remedial in nature, and by this I mean that Congress intended to correct problems on the reservation both in the criminal and in the civil jurisdictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="753.350" offset="3149757">In Bryan v. Ithasca County this Court provided that the state if they assume civil jurisdiction may adjudicate cases between Indians even as between Indians and may apply their state law to govern those actions.</text>
            <text syncTime="771.141" offset="3220915">Consequently in this Court's decisions construing Public Law 280 there is no indication that preexisting rights of Indians were terminated, and this Court in a course of decisions over the last hundred or more years has indicated that Indians have the right to seek the aid of state courts and state statute in protecting their property against intrusion by non-Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="802.066" offset="3344631">Justice Lamar in Choit v. Trap at 224 U.S. 665 said that Indians' rights, their private rights, are enforced to the same extent and in the same way as other residents or citizens of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="819.231" offset="3413280">That decision came in the context of Indians enforcing their federal tax exemption in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="826.853" offset="3443687">The power the Indian people have to sue in state court to protect their property rights has been exercised on a number of occasions, first, in a decision in 1857 Fellows v. Blacksmith 19 Howard this Court affirmed a state court order ejecting non-Indians from tribal lands.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.593" offset="3534698">This Court likewise indicated that the states may seek the aid of state statute in New York--</text>

            <text syncTime="865.525" offset="3598436">This Court upheld that exercise of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="868.571" offset="3610557">Here you have a different situation where I do not see those are necessarily relevant because here the state court says our law provides that in the absent of consent by the Indians under the 1968 revisions of the Public Law 280 we are not to exercise jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="890.561" offset="3698538">However, that decision turns on an interpretation of Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="895.169" offset="3717032">The decision below clearly states that the Court feels that the state legislature was disclaiming jurisdiction under Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="907.054" offset="3764575">Consequently, the question arises does Public Law 280, not state law authorize a bar against these sorts of actions?</text>

            <text syncTime="1455.363" offset="5957816">I perhaps most usefully could begin by addressing Justice Stevens' concern, that is, the exact basis on which to the extent that we can discern it from its opinion the North Dakota Supreme Court rested its judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.653" offset="6026988">I draw the Court's attention to the end of that opinion which is at page 10A of the petition appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="1481.384" offset="6061888">The court is here addressing and very conscious of the constitutional problem both under the state constitution and under the federal constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1492.006" offset="6104311">It would arise if the state courts were closed to Indians in this discriminatory way absent special authorization by the Congress for that closure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1505.999" offset="6160317">The court concludes its opinion by saying after discussing this constitutional problem and saying that it does not stand as an impediment to their result.</text>
            <text syncTime="1518.900" offset="6211935">Quoting from this Court's opinion in the Yakima case and in the words of the North Dakota court,</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.818" offset="6251641">"Likewise the people of North Dakota and the legislature were acting under explicit authority granted by Congress in the exercise of its federal power over Indians when our constitution was amended and Chapter 2719 of the North Dakota Code was enacted. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1549.575" offset="6334606">"We, therefore, find no equal protection violation of the Constitution of either the state or the United States, and for the reasons stated we affirm the judgment of the District Court. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.398" offset="6389881">It seems to us plain that the North Dakota Supreme Court was resting its judgment that no constitutional violation either of its own or of the federal constitution was involved only because they construed Public Law 280 as having authorized not as Public Law 280 does authorize an assumption of new jurisdiction but a disclaimer, a repudiation of preexisting jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1600.680" offset="6539093">If the North Dakota Supreme Court were disabused of that misreading of Public Law 280 every indication is that the court would then find that there was no justification under either its own constitution or under the federal constitution for uniquely closing the courts of the state to Indian plaintiffs whether the tribe or individual members.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.090" offset="6656644">For that reason we suggest that the appropriate disposition is to remand the case to the North Dakota Supreme Court with a construction of Public Law 280 which we have argued.</text>

            <text syncTime="1672.884" offset="6827903">Justice Rehnquist, we do not oppose the suggestion that if the federal constitutional question is as plain as we think it is that it would be appropriate for this Court to go ahead and decide it and accordingly to reverse the judgment without need for any further proceedings except for trial of the contract claim in the District Court of North Dakota.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.388" offset="6945872">Our suggestion is simply that as a matter of deference to the state court this Court might think it more appropriate to afford the highest court of the state an opportunity to correct its own error without the misapprehension which led it into that error rather than a simple reversal, but it is really not for us as a mere amicus in the case to be suggesting in any strong way what the appropriate disposition is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.498" offset="7106368">We ourselves have no doubt that in the absence of any federal authorization for discriminating against Indian plaintiffs the federal constitution would require North Dakota to admit them to its courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.552" offset="7174495">We likewise assume from what the North Dakota Supreme Court itself has said that the state constitution would require that result, and if there is a state constitutional ground it might be appropriate to afford that court an opportunity to revoke it.</text>

            <text syncTime="1787.603" offset="7286717">It does seem to us that Section 1981 may well be applicable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1792.336" offset="7305630">However, it is fair to say that as far as I am aware that ground was not argued below, and accordingly it might be particularly inappropriate for this court to reach that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1807.940" offset="7368115">We simply mention it as one more indication of the problem that is created by this misreading of Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="1818.734" offset="7411269">As to that it seems to us quite clear that Public Law 280 was intended in its own words under Section 6 to remove impediments to the assumption of jurisdiction, not to erect new impediments... No license is given for that... and to the assumption of jurisdiction, not a disclaimer of jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.940" offset="7524118">Likewise Section 7 is clear in that it gives federal permission to states not having jurisdiction over certain categories of claims involving Indians to assume jurisdiction, not to repudiate previously existing jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1872.148" offset="7624951">I may say that the North Dakota amendment to its constitution itself suggests no direction to the legislature of the state to repudiate any previously existing jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1890.126" offset="7696840">On the contrary, all that happened in 1958 is that the people of that state in response to Public Law 280 and with in a way that on its face seems unobjectionable said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1905.401" offset="7757966">"We retain our disclaimer of jurisdiction over Indian lands provided, however, that the legislature may accept such jurisdiction as is delegated by act of Congress. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.753" offset="7819302">That in no way to us suggests any repudiation of preexisting jurisdiction, and indeed the 1963 act of the state legislature speaks of jurisdiction being extended to cases involving Indians, nothing about disclaiming or repudiating older jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1945.526" offset="7918463">Because those statutes and constitutional amendments read in that way it is and must be inviting to the Supreme Court of North Dakota to reconstrue those statutes which are perfectly able to be read as consistent with Public Law 280 in that way once this Court has indicated that Public Law 280 did not authorize any repudiation of old jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.527" offset="8062449">Of course, it is possible to argue that notwithstanding Public Law 280 the states might be free to disclaim quite independently of any federal authorization of jurisdiction over Indians, but the decisions of this Court made it clear that there is no federal obstacle to the assumption of jurisdiction over a claim by an Indian against non-Indians within the state at least in the absence of any tribal court which has asserted that jurisdiction and certainly not when the tribe itself is the plaintiff.</text>
            <text syncTime="2023.026" offset="8228379">There can be no arguable conclusion into the tribal self-government when the tribe is the plaintiff as is here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.398" offset="8261920">The irony of this case is that the claim of tribal self-government and infringement is made by the non-Indian defendant, not by the tribe itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.907" offset="8315942">It is a case where the defendant is being more Roman than the Romans.</text>
            <text syncTime="2051.576" offset="8342587">The preexisting law before Public Law 280 in this Court and in the state courts was quite clear that states could assume jurisdiction over this sort of claim by an Indian.</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.863" offset="8431821">In the absence of any federal impediment to the assumption of that jurisdiction we as we have suggested see a serious equal protection constitutional obstacle to declining to exercise that.</text>

            <label>Mr. Hugh Mc Cutcheon</label>
            <text syncTime="2165.513" offset="8798371">I think our question and this question are fairly close and are before the Court, but what has happened that I think that this question has galloped around in the various briefs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.509" offset="8854378">I was and possibly I should not do it... I thought I would try and bring it back to the question as it existed on the application for writ of certiorari by showing the distinction, but it is easy to find the distinction if the Court will simply recognize that in the government's brief on the certiorari application they stated the question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2207.372" offset="8965764">There are some extraneous words in it that should be stricken, but when that is done it comes basically back to the Petitioners' question, and in our brief on the same point the certiorari the question there then comes very close to what I have outlined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.334" offset="9037653">Then it begins to deviate, and in the Petitioners' brief on the merits the questions presented which presumptively to me mean the issues there are now three different questions set out.</text>
            <text syncTime="2240.938" offset="9100033">Number one is not in this proceeding at all in my judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2245.343" offset="9117692">Number two should be carved of extraneous language to bring it somewhat within the question upon which we think the writ of certiorari was granted, and number three should be also reworked because we now get into equal protection and due process clauses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2270.894" offset="9219883">Let me say this that those clauses were argued in the North Dakota Supreme Court, and the North Dakota Supreme Court did reach those issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="2286.466" offset="9282159">Then that issue, however, was not an issue in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2296.805" offset="9323537">So we do feel that the question should be restated, and finally in connection with the final brief served upon us which is the Petitioners' reply brief we do not agree with the statement made in the first sentence that we are in agreement with the Petitioners that there is only a sole issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2360.000" offset="9576298">--It was reached by the court below, but I believe that there has been extraneous or extra material now brought into this argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.603" offset="9622691">Let us turn for a moment to some of the argument advanced by both counsel for the Petitioner and counsel for the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.787" offset="9659472">The argument seems to be made that the North Dakota Supreme Court was incorrect in its conclusion and specifically that the North Dakota Supreme Court should have recognized that it had prior jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.948" offset="9768141">What counsel for the Petitioners is arguing today is that 280 did not bar a prior exercise of jurisdiction by a court, but that presumes something.</text>
            <text syncTime="2426.238" offset="9841284">This Court has stated many times in these cases that the jurisdiction must be conferred by an act of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.436" offset="9894051">Now until 280 which this Court has said in several recent cases... I believe you said it just a couple of months ago in the New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache case... that 280 was the first, not the second, but was the first grant of power of general applicability with respect to this type of a matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2475.843" offset="10039710">Now if you said it it must be so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.373" offset="10053816">You have said it in other cases, and we certainly accept that and why?</text>
            <text syncTime="2484.886" offset="10075863">For one reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.042" offset="10080461">We do not find that North Dakota has ever been given outside of an Indian act in the middle forties any grant of power by the Congress of the United States for our courts to assume jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.205" offset="10165098">So it is not a question of the old jurisdiction because if they didn't have jurisdiction because it was not conferred upon them then there would be no prior jurisdiction that could spring back into existence or if not springing back into existence would have remained in existence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2532.022" offset="10264363">It was never there in the first instance.</text>

            <text syncTime="2559.231" offset="10373241">I'm sorry let's go... Let me change my argument just a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.963" offset="10396125">Public Law 280, 1953.</text>
            <text syncTime="2569.710" offset="10415142">Five years later, 1958, North Dakota through its people amended its constitution pursuant to the authority granted by 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="2584.190" offset="10473134">That is the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2587.111" offset="10484732">Five years after that in 1963 North Dakota adopted the legislation through its legislature to further implement the matters and that is now found as 27-19 of the North Dakota Century Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="2609.960" offset="10576160">Five years after that Congress enacted the Indian Civil Rights Act, 1953, 1958, 1963, 1968.</text>
            <text syncTime="2627.079" offset="10644601">Now what North Dakota did because the Indians asked for it when North Dakota in 1963 adopted Chapter 27-19 of the Century Code they did what?</text>
            <text syncTime="2643.493" offset="10710325">They put in a consent clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2646.680" offset="10723073">They said this jurisdiction which we are imposing at this time becomes effective when?</text>
            <text syncTime="2654.707" offset="10755152">Upon consent by the Indians through an election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2658.176" offset="10769049">We preceded the Indian Civil Rights Act in that respect by five years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.797" offset="10807501">Now go to the North Dakota cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2671.062" offset="10820562">In 1957 there was the case of Vermillion v. Spotted Elk, and our court there held that it had jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.836" offset="10883674">In that our court was in error.</text>
            <text syncTime="2691.896" offset="10903945">Our court, however, subsequently in In re White Shield said in effect we were wrong in that case, and In re White Shield our court said this and In re White Shield is in 1963.</text>
            <text syncTime="2719.150" offset="11012928">Here is what our court said,</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.119" offset="11020765">"However, by the amendment of Section 203 of the North Dakota Constitution and the passage of Chapter 244 of the session laws of 1963. "</text>

            <text syncTime="2970.486" offset="12018224">Mr. McCutcheon, you said a moment ago that in Gourneau the Supreme Court of North Dakota stated that it had overruled White Shield.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.702" offset="12051138">Is that what you meant?</text>

            <label>Mr. Hugh Mc Cutcheon</label>
            <text syncTime="2983.451" offset="12070156">I'm sorry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.483" offset="12070051">No, sir.</text>
            <text syncTime="2981.077" offset="12069947">I did make a mistake, Spotted Elk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.637" offset="12078828">We conclude that Vermillion which is Vermillion v. Spotted Elk no longer states the rule to be applied in determining whether state courts have jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3000.614" offset="12138805">Now this Court has indicated as a matter of fact that the preemption doctrine applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="3016.109" offset="12200768">This Court has also stated and it was well stated in New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache that the preemption doctrine is not quite the same as a normal preemption doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3037.180" offset="12285091">The normal preemption doctrine would simply be that something is supreme and there would be no alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="3048.002" offset="12328350">This Court has extended that because it has said that there are exceptions and certain of those exceptions, for example, are tax cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="3057.374" offset="12365862">There are exceptional circumstances where the courts may have some jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3061.199" offset="12381117">It was interesting to note that Petitioners' counsel referred to the case of something versus Dorgan.</text>
            <text syncTime="3069.228" offset="12413196">True, a North Dakota case cited in 1973.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.131" offset="12440885">It's a tax case, but in that case our court said... and the facts were stipulated incidentally... our court said that our courts have no jurisdiction over civil causes of action with respect to the Indian reservations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.639" offset="12518835">Our court is now very, very consistent.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.419" offset="12530015">This Court has not too long ago in one of the cases stated that tribal... Yes, Rice v. Rehner... that tribal sovereignty itself exists at the suffrance or pleasure of the Congress of the United States.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.047" offset="12640461">This Court has also stated the present policy of Congress which is to try to bring the Indians... This is the policy of 280... to try to bring the Indians into the full mainstream of our society.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.603" offset="12710783">That is one of the purposes of 280 as I understand it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3147.759" offset="12727396">Certainly the states do appear to be working for that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.007" offset="12752369">The mandatory states under 280 were, what, granted instant jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3165.297" offset="12797509">The disclaimer states were required to remove an impediment to the assumption of that jurisdiction, but again assumption in that sense means exactly what the Act seems to say.</text>
            <text syncTime="3181.682" offset="12863024">It is the assumption of any jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3185.852" offset="12879743">In North Dakota it would be the assumption of jurisdiction in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.835" offset="12907641">There were acts, for example, in Minnesota which I understand did grant certain jurisdiction, certain congressional acts, but none in North Dakota and in reviewing all of these cases it is necessary to draw the distinctions with respect to certain state situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3217.542" offset="13006489">For example, Candelaria, a 1926 case, is advanced in the brief of Petitioners and the government, but go back to 1919 and look at the case of Pueblo Santa Rose which is mentioned in Candelaria and it tells you from whence came the power of those courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3242.799" offset="13107530">The power of those state courts came from treaties with Mexico and Spain, and they were carried forward into the law and they were carried forward into the state law by act of Congress, by requirement of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3262.258" offset="13185375">The same is true, for example, with some of these states, for example, in the area of Oklahoma, Arkansas and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3270.272" offset="13217454">North Dakota had a territorial government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.614" offset="13230828">Oklahoma, some of those states did not have an organized territorial government.</text>
            <text syncTime="3279.206" offset="13253189">There were certain laws in the unorganized territory that were created by Congress, certain courts that were created by Congress, and in statehood that followed those were required to be carried forward into the state laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="3299.574" offset="13334587">We have varying situations, but in North Dakota there has never been a prior grant, a specific prior grant of authority from the Congress of the United States which wails the authority in these instances for a special people who have a different relationship than others.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.590" offset="13482649">The test has always been as stated in Williams v. Lee whether there is any infringement upon the basic rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="3354.551" offset="13554538">North Dakota has met all requirements set forth by 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.407" offset="13589960">We took those step by step.</text>
            <text syncTime="3367.734" offset="13607305">We did it by a vote of the people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3371.513" offset="13622352">We amended our constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="3373.965" offset="13632174">We acted by our legislature and we have taken the procedural steps required by Public Law 280.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.601" offset="13674701">In Yakima, Washington v. Yakima, the matter there was Washington having taken or having set full jurisdiction over eight subject matter areas, and the attack there was made you couldn't do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3404.766" offset="13755367">You had to take either all or none, and this Court said no, you have the power to take the whole.</text>
            <text syncTime="3410.482" offset="13778250">You may take the lesser, and that does make logic.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.527" offset="13794446">There have been challenges to 280, but 280 has withstood those challenges.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.753" offset="13875321">It now requires that which we took five years before 1968 the consent of the Indians.</text>
            <text syncTime="3447.779" offset="13927462">The doctrine of conceptual clarity which existed in the days of 150 years ago in the Winchester v. Georgia case where it simply said that there was no jurisdiction there except that which was granted by Congress, and it was totally exclusive.</text>
            <text syncTime="3480.750" offset="14059328">The state might not enter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3482.328" offset="14065597">That has been modified.</text>
            <text syncTime="3484.155" offset="14072912">There are some exceptions now to that particular doctrine, and that is rather stated carefully in New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.447" offset="14126097">It basically comes back to three areas that Indian tribes have been implicitly divested of their sovereignty in certain respects by virtue of their dependent status, that under certain circumstances a state may validly assert authority over the activities of nonmembers on a reservation and that in exceptional circumstances a state may assume--</text>
