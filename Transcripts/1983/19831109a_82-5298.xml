            <text syncTime="19.003" offset="223451">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="22.976" offset="239334">On February 12, 1981 law enforcement officials forceably entered the home of the Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.062" offset="279667">At the time of the entry the police had no search warrant or arrest warrant nor the consent of any of the occupants.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.800" offset="318641">No exigent circumstances existed which could justify the actions of the police.</text>
            <text syncTime="50.105" offset="347898">The only excuse for the entry was the belief by the police that contraband was concealed within the dwelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.870" offset="386873">Having once violated the privacy of the home the police removed all of the occupants and remained there by themselves for a continuous period of some 19 hours.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.549" offset="445596">Thereafter the police obtained a search warrant based on knowledge they possessed many hours before the entry and occupation, and upon execution of the warrant contraband was discovered secreted within the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="89.870" offset="506932">The question before this Court is whether that contraband should be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.925" offset="539115">We respectfully submit that the unlawful entry into, seizure and 19 hour continuous occupation of the Petitioners' home constituted a seizure under the Fourth Amendment not only of the home but of its contents.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.040" offset="627618">Since the actions of the police constituted a seizure of the contraband before the search warrant was ever obtained any doctrine of attenuation under the exclusionary rule would not apply in this case, and in fact the purposes of the exclusionary rule would be achieved by its application here.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.617" offset="733884">The facts are not in doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="153.282" offset="760529">On February 12, 1981 in New York City at about 5:30 in the afternoon the police observed what appeared to them to be a drug transaction on the streets of Queens, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.021" offset="823536">At 6:30, an hour later, they telephoned the United States Attorneys' Office for the Eastern District of New York to make inquiries about perhaps arresting the Petitioners and getting a search warrant to search their apartment in Queens, New York.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.933" offset="895216">They were told by an Assistant United States Attorney at 6:30 in the evening that the magistrate was not around, and he suggested or directed the police to go to the premises, the apartment building, to arrest the Petitioners if they saw them and to secure the premises from the outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.390" offset="1000960">The Assistant United States Attorney further directed the agents not to enter the apartment unless exigent circumstances should occur.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Peter J. Fabricant</label>
            <text syncTime="344.537" offset="1525603">But I believe, Justice Powell, that it is the neutral and detached magistrate who in the first instance must make the determination of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.216" offset="1584326">I think one of the main problems in this case is that the police, sure, they had a great deal of suspicion that there was contraband in the apartment, but the Constitution and really all of the cases of this Court dealing with dwellings say that absent exigent circumstances the police must get a warrant before they cross the threshold of the premises.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="383.472" stopTime="405.044">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="383.472" offset="1681293">Well, Mr. Fabricant, there is certainly some of our cases dealing with say a suitcase or whatever it was in Arkansas v. Sanders and the footlocker in Chadwick that say even though the police may not inspect a container without a warrant they can detain it while they are getting a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.243" offset="1756421">Now why is this case any different from those?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="peter_j_fabricant" startTime="405.044" stopTime="469.158">
            <label>Mr. Peter J. Fabricant</label>
            <text syncTime="405.044" offset="1767601">It is different because it is in a home where one has the highest expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.859" offset="1790903">In Arkansas v. Sanders and in United States v. Chadwick... Well, Chadwick dealt with a footlocker that I believe was being put into an automobile and Arkansas v. Sanders dealt with a suitcase which was in an automobile or being carried around by somebody outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="430.222" offset="1868329">The difference is I believe twofold.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.583" offset="1877734">First of all, the actions of the police in Arkansas v. Sanders and United States v. Chadwick in the seizure might be considered as reasonable because under the circumstances the mobility of the suitcase and the footlocker would mean that if they went to get a warrant the automobiles and the suitcases with the possible contraband in them would not be around any more.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.850" offset="1970834">The other difference is that in Sanders and Chadwick the police were at a place and in a position where they had an absolute right to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="465.064" offset="2007719">They were not in somebody's house.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.817" offset="2014720">They were out in the public.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="469.158" offset="2024019">Mr. Fabricant, in your view could the police have secured the house from the outside for 19 hours while they got the warrant not letting anybody in or out?</text>

            <text syncTime="1543.653" offset="6321998">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1546.615" offset="6333910">Let me start by just listing some basic things about this case that are not disputed to put it in context.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.619" offset="6361913">First, the officers lawfully acquired probable cause to arrest both Petitioners and to believe that there was a substantial quantity of cocaine in their apartment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.217" offset="6404336">Second, the officers did not immediately conduct a warrantless search of the apartment on the basis of this information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.432" offset="6429205">Rather, they consulted with an Assistant United States Attorney and then staked out the apartment for the purpose of apprehending Petitioners and preventing possible destruction of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1581.638" offset="6474031">Third, the officers lawfully arrested the Petitioner Segura when he arrived at the apartment at 11 p.m. Fourth, the officers then entered the apartment because they believed that such action was necessary to prevent destruction of evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.538" offset="6533590">In fact, the Court of Appeals held and we do not dispute here they had an insufficient basis for concluding that there were exigent circumstances justifying a warrantless entry and, therefore, their entry did violate the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1609.755" offset="6586462">Fifth, when the officers entered they conducted only a limited security search and not a full evidentiary search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1619.382" offset="6624914">Some evidence was found at the time of this limited security search, and that has been suppressed, but nothing seen during this initial search contributed in any way to the issuance of the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.629" offset="6669949">Sixth, the occupants of the apartment including Petitioner Colon were arrested and removed from the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.925" offset="6699102">Seventh, subsequently 19 hours later a valid warrant issued and the search under its authority uncovered the evidence at issue in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.822" offset="6742674">Now I think it is black letter law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.694" offset="6754168">I do not understand anybody to really dispute it although I am not sure that the exclusionary rule does not operate on Fourth Amendment violations in the abstract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.482" offset="6797322">Rather, it calls for the suppression of evidence that is sufficiently connected to or produced by a Fourth Amendment violation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.706" offset="6834311">Now in this case the evidence was discovered and seized during the execution of a valid and untainted search warrant issued by a judicial officer on a showing of lawfully acquired probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.254" offset="6880496">Now the events surrounding this transaction also did include an unlawful entry into the premises where the evidence was ultimately found, but the Second Circuit concluded and we submit to this Court that there was no sufficient connection between the illegality and the acquisition of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1702.306" offset="6956669">Two theories have been advanced to get around the simplicity and I think compelling nature of our position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.772" offset="6990524">The first is Petitioners' theory that there was somehow an unlawful seizure of this evidence in the course of the illegal entry and that this made it primary evidence not subject to any fruits analysis and, therefore, not requiring a connection between the illegality and the discovery of the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.597" offset="7077773">The second is the theory of the District Court that there was a causal connection.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.774" offset="7110583">That is, there was a hypothetical causal connection because had the illegal entry not occurred the occupants of the apartment might have destroyed the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1750.111" offset="7147885">Now I want to discuss both these theories because I do not think they stand up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.323" offset="7176725">But in order to make the case simpler I would like to start with looking at the situation in which the house was empty because I think that would make our position clear in its pristine form.</text>
            <text syncTime="1769.472" offset="7225312">If the officers enter an empty house it is still a violation of the Fourth Amendment if they do not have a warrant or exigent circumstances.</text>

            <text syncTime="1785.504" offset="7289469">Well, with a place of business there would be a question as to what the zone of privacy or private areas are, but they would require a warrant or exigent circumstances in private areas of a place of business as a home.</text>
            <text syncTime="1798.991" offset="7343386">I mean, I think the Court has held that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1804.495" offset="7365433">I do not think that is an issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1806.586" offset="7373792">The point is that they would illegally enter the home then some time later the warrant would issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1813.842" offset="7402840">They would conduct their search.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.033" offset="7407543">They would find the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="1816.022" offset="7411513">I do not see any conceivable way in those circumstances in which it can be said that the evidence is a fruit of the unlawful entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.768" offset="7442547">So unless the Court is going to totally abandon the notion that there does have to be a connection between the illegality and the evidence that is sought to be admitted at trial at least in the empty house situation--</text>

            <text syncTime="1840.458" offset="7509316">I think his argument would be if they had gone out and left the place and then gone 19 hours for the warrant they would not have the same complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="1855.208" offset="7568248">But somehow they say the fact that they stayed there in the house for 19 hours negated the whole thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.226" offset="7608372">Incidentally, did they get overtime for that 19 hours?</text>

            <text syncTime="1871.548" offset="7633658">Let me address the 19 hour point because... I do not defend the police staying inside the apartment after the premises were secured.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.337" offset="7684754">I believe that that is not a justifiable or reasonable action because it is not necessary, and it does seem to me that that is a continuing search while they are in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.418" offset="7741074">The whole point of why they cannot enter without a warrant is that that entry constitutes a search, not a seizure but a search of the premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.272" offset="7772525">So I do not defend their staying in.</text>

            <text syncTime="1935.201" offset="7888196">The point that I want to make about the 19 hours because I think it is critical to this case is that it is perfectly obvious that if they stayed inside or outside during the 19 hours that cannot possibly have any connection with the discovery of the evidence under the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.770" offset="7946501">As long as they were entitled to secure the premises from the outside which I do not understand my opponent to dispute, it is just an illegality hanging in the air.</text>

            <text syncTime="2788.890" offset="11303027">So I do not think the magistrate if he were applying the exclusionary rule at an initial appearance would be justified in releasing her simply because the arrest had been accompanied by an unlawful search of her house.</text>

            <text syncTime="3151.579" offset="12753763">I was saying the only reason we discussed that point in our brief is because my opponent tries to make much of the fact that this is a flagrant or egregious violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.755" offset="12790439">I want to get to the point about if we are going to worry about deterrents in the air should we just abandon the Court's normal principles of requiring a nexus between the evidence and the illegality because something that has concerned some courts a rule that would allow the use of evidence in a case like this may unduly encourage the police to engage in Fourth Amendment violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="3189.894" offset="12907049">There are several things to be said about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.906" offset="12919066">The first is that this is a situation which does not inherently... The rule for which we contend does not inherently lend itself to encouraging flagrant violations of the Fourth Amendment because the more clear it is to the police that there are no exigent circumstances the less they have to gain by entering the premises rather than waiting for the warrant which they fully believe they have probable cause to get and will get.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.054" offset="13027631">When they enter the premises they can only have the benefit of evidence that is held not to be a fruit of the entry so under the holding of the Court of Appeals in this case and as I think Justice O'Connor pointed out earlier they still run the substantial risk that evidence that is found during the original unlawful entry if it is unlawful will be suppressed.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.329" offset="13120731">In addition, the problem of flagrant violations is an area where civil liability is a meaningful remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3256.427" offset="13173185">That is, the risk of encouraging flagrant violations is attenuated or offset by the fact that if it is flagrant there is potential civil liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.059" offset="13239640">Now I think that is all I have unless the Court has any further questions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3428.850" offset="13862818">Well, but you spoke of it in terms of the expectation of privacy which is the way the courts have spoken of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3435.004" offset="13887477">It is the subjective feeling of the occupant of the home that he or she or all of them are going to be secure.</text>

            <text syncTime="3455.087" offset="13967830">Perhaps because home is mentioned in the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <text syncTime="3460.890" offset="13991027">It would be perhaps a slighter less degree of expectation of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.862" offset="14010880">I do not think it would be much less.</text>
            <text syncTime="3468.005" offset="14019448">It is just that this Court has always stressed that the home has the highest degree of expectation; therefore, perhaps an office has a slightly less degree.</text>
            <text syncTime="3479.142" offset="14063960">Certainly even a criminal committing crimes in his or her home has an expectation of privacy that the police will not violate the privacy of the home even though they are committing crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3494.383" offset="14124983">I think the framers in effect weighed that, and this Court has said that the man has a right to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3511.804" offset="14194677">Unfortunately Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases that get to this Court always seem to deal with criminals.</text>

            <text syncTime="3520.890" offset="14231040">But it seems to me I would not like it if the police using their own discretion came into my apartment in New York and stayed 19 hours because they believed I had contraband and then continued to search and not search depending on what a magistrate does the next day.</text>
            <text syncTime="3539.043" offset="14303556">That would affect my rights as not a criminal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.846" offset="14326857">The difference between seizing from the outside and securing from the outside and doing what the police did here is not a difference in result.</text>
            <text syncTime="3556.373" offset="14372937">The result would have been the same, the securing of the evidence, but I think on the outside would have been reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.146" offset="14400000">I would equate the going inside rather than securing it from the outside as opening the trunk in Chadwick before they got the warrant or opening the suitcase in Arkansas v. Sanders before they got the warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.039" offset="14467605">Even though the house might be considered seized even from the outside that would be perhaps a reasonable seizure.</text>
