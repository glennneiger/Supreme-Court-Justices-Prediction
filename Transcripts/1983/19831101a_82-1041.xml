            <text syncTime="80.035" offset="460222">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="83.070" offset="472448">This is a gift tax case, here on a writ of certiorari to the Eleventh Circuit, which reversed a decision for the taxpayers by the United States Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.212" offset="525006">It involves loans from a father to his son, who worked with him in the family businesses, and from that father to a family-owned corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.519" offset="574221">All loans were non-interest-bearing, and the stated terms of all were repayable on demand, with one exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.843" offset="615494">A note, while a ten-year note on its face, was determined by the Tax Court as a fact to be repayable on demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.235" offset="665022">Therefore, there is only one issue: Are demand loans subject to gift tax on imputed interest?</text>
            <text syncTime="141.241" offset="705042">There is no subterfuge involved.</text>
            <text syncTime="145.727" offset="723014">The validity of the loans are not challenged by the Respondent.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.898" offset="747674">All loans are bona fide and they are what they purport to be.</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank P. Riggs</label>
            <text syncTime="163.689" offset="794903">The major case is Berkman in the United States Tax Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.360" offset="817577">There they were able to fit into what is now 2512(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="177.532" offset="850283">There was an exchange.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.899" offset="855716">As long as the term notes, as in the Berkman and Blackburn cases, were given in exchange, we fit into the exception to the normal definition of gift that's listed by Section 2512(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="196.577" offset="926456">I'll come back to that if I may, sir.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="199.029" offset="936278">Mr. Riggs, when you responded to the Chief's question about term notes, does that imply a term note at no interest?</text>

            <text syncTime="208.685" offset="974834">I made that assumption.</text>
            <text syncTime="212.253" offset="989150">The son in this case, Lyle Dickman, died in December of 1976.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.209" offset="1024990">The father in this case, Paul Dickman... I'm sorry, the son died in May.</text>
            <text syncTime="227.548" offset="1050276">The father died in December of 1976, both dying in the same year.</text>
            <text syncTime="234.302" offset="1077339">In Lyle's estate, the son's estate, 100 percent of the unpaid balances on the indebtedness at issue here were deducted and that deduction was accepted by the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="250.312" offset="1141391">In Paul's estate, the father's estate, all of the notes at issue here were reported as assets at 100 percent of the unpaid balance, and that estate tax return was accepted by the Internal Revenue Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.506" offset="1206175">Our point or our position and what we would like to emphasize here at oral argument can be stated briefly in three points:</text>
            <text syncTime="277.778" offset="1251210">One, the Gift Tax Code cannot be reasonably interpreted to include the Respondent's right to use theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.053" offset="1296350">Whis theory that there is a property right to use we submit amounts to no more than the attempt to tax potential income as a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.180" offset="1356849">Second, the decision below, if it is upheld, will destroy the reasonable expectations of many taxpayers and will add to an already overburdened judiciary.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.807" offset="1419334">Three, if there is a gap in the present law which should be corrected, Congress should act and not the Executive or the Judicial Branches.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="330.247" offset="1461130">Mr. Riggs, were tax lawyers advising their clients that the position you espouse is correct before the Crown case?</text>

            <label>Mr. Frank P. Riggs</label>
            <text syncTime="346.458" offset="1525914">Justice O'Connor, I don't know how they were advising their clients.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.212" offset="1556947">Before Crown, a district court in the Middle District of Texas, if I remember correctly, decided this same issue and decided it in favor of the taxpayer, and the Government did not appeal that decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="370.674" offset="1622776">That, before the Crown case, was the only judicial action in the area to my knowledge.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="379.930" offset="1659870">It goes to your second point, about the reasonable expectation of taxpayers, and I wondered whether that is essentially post-Crown decisions effects.</text>

            <text syncTime="394.622" offset="1718593">I really believe that what's at stake here has been common among families as long as there have been families.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.878" offset="1755582">And a great many of these loans are made with absolutely no tax results in mind at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.651" offset="1790691">That's the reason I was hesitant to respond to you what tax lawyers are doing.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="417.138" stopTime="434.064">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="417.138" offset="1808663">Well, I suppose a great many intra-family loans can be made without tax consequences under the provisions for the annual giving without tax consequences and the cumulative life exemption.</text>

            <text syncTime="434.766" offset="1879194">But an awful lot of taxpayers annually make the amount of the annual exclusion as a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.788" offset="1915243">Then the very next dollar after that either results in a tax or it reduces a one-time lifetime credit.</text>

            <text syncTime="463.600" offset="1994550">Suppose the father, a father, owns a commercial building and the son occupies the commercial building, conducting a business, and he charges no rent.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.176" offset="2052856">Would the reasonable value of the rent of that property be taxable as a gift in your view?</text>

          <turn speaker="frank_p_riggs" startTime="484.763" stopTime="563.282">
            <label>Mr. Frank P. Riggs</label>
            <text syncTime="484.763" offset="2079187">No, sir, not unless you add something into the Gift Tax Code that has never been there before.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.786" offset="2111266">Our basic position in regard to the Code, Mr. Chief Justice, is that the 1932 Congress knew what they were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="506.546" offset="2166332">They didn't pass a tax which taxed transfers of property by gift in a vacuum.</text>
            <text syncTime="516.568" offset="2206351">There already existed a common law of gifts.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.038" offset="2224219">It was very clear under the common law of gifts that any consideration negated a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.144" offset="2260686">In fact, as we cite you to the Zeller case in our reply brief, a loan was the antithesis of a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.667" offset="2294750">And our position is that the United States Congress knew that.</text>
            <text syncTime="541.619" offset="2306557">They deliberately took the word 2501 and left it in there.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.640" offset="2346681">We have, we think, a great many indications that that was deliberate on the part of the United States Congress, that includes many fine lawyers.</text>

            <text syncTime="566.584" offset="2406449">Suppose after several years of allowing the son to use the commercial building rent-free, the father gives him a quitclaim deed.</text>
            <text syncTime="579.208" offset="2456918">Taxable, the value of the property?</text>

            <text syncTime="608.244" offset="2573110">The great difference, Your Honor, is the common law on which the statute is superimposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.065" offset="2600382">A use... and incidentally, the use doesn't have to be actual under the Government's theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="621.737" offset="2627027">The mere opportunity is all that's required.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.523" offset="2642178">But a use has never been a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.075" offset="2656389">And our whole point is that the Congress knew how to write this statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.978" offset="2684079">When they used the word 2512(b), if you please.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.234" offset="2713022">There they say that the excess of property conveyed over a consideration received, not is a gift... the United States Congress knew that a loan was not a gift... but they said it would be deemed a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="661.462" offset="2785956">That's how the Berkman case came about, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="669.385" offset="2817617">The loan in the Berkman case, the term loan, was not a gift, was not a gift as the United States Congress understood.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.423" offset="2857845">But it fell under 2512(b) and was deemed a gift.</text>

            <text syncTime="1566.666" offset="6406737">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1577.605" offset="6450518">Let me say a word first in response to some questions that have arisen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1582.175" offset="6468803">The commentary, in response to Justice O'Connor's question, in the journals in response to both the Crown decision and its predecessor district court decision in Johnson... and we've cited many of these commentaries... were almost uniformly critical and indicative that well-informed tax lawyers did not believe that the gift tax did not reach demand loans of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="1616.996" offset="6608088">During this early period when interest rates were low, this kind of device in tax planning was not widely encountered.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.239" offset="6661065">There wasn't litigation on this subject.</text>
            <text syncTime="1632.774" offset="6671200">And the many articles cited... one amicus brief says there are hundreds of articles since Crown advocating this device for tax planning... have arisen since the Crown decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.034" offset="6732222">This Court in Commissioner against Wemyss, W-e-m-y-s-s, which we have cited in our brief, pointed out that the gift tax law did depart from the common law of what constitutes a gift and instead set up a broad statutory definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.816" offset="6831383">Perhaps the most obvious way in which it departed from the common law is in Section 2512(b) of the Code, which is cited on pages 2 and 3 of our brief, which says that:</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.778" offset="6903272">"Where property is transferred for less than an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth, then the amount by which the value of the property exceeded the value of the consideration shall be deemed a gift. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.537" offset="6958234">At common law, if there was consideration it wasn't a gift.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.989" offset="6972026">But the gift tax sets up its own definitions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1714.410" offset="6997731">In our view, this case presents one of those happy situations in which the correct answer under the statute coincides with the common sense answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.236" offset="7053110">Any person in this courtroom would find it a valuable benefit to be given gratuitously an unrestricted right to use several hundreds of thousands of dollars.</text>

            <text syncTime="1748.566" offset="7134403">The example cited by some of the amicus briefs of a parent loaning a child $10,000 to go back to school interest-free, or presumably at even below the market rate, would be a gift in the Government's view.</text>

            <text syncTime="1845.647" offset="7522688">Well, there are many difficult questions under the gift tax law, many of which will remain, however this case is decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="1854.769" offset="7559154">Many of them revolve around the question of what constitutes support for dependents that traditionally has not been subjected to the gift tax, and these questions arise whether what is involved is a loan or the direct payment of a corpus that constitutes support.</text>
            <text syncTime="1884.772" offset="7679213">The same question arises with respect to a dependent whether you allow that person to have the use of a portion of your residence or whether you supply food and clothing for that individual which is consumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="1904.618" offset="7758626">And ordinarily, the Congress and the courts and the Commissioner have proceeded on the assumption that when there's a legal obligation to provide support the provision of that support is not a gift subject to the gift tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.134" offset="7852666">What if it goes beyond a legal obligation to a moral obligation?</text>
            <text syncTime="1932.419" offset="7869803">These are difficult questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.538" offset="7878266">There is a great difference between providing the ordinary items of clothing, even if they may be provided rather lavishly, and providing a series of diamond bracelets which become a means of transferring wealth from one generation to the next.</text>

            <text syncTime="1955.301" offset="7961336">It has to be looked at in terms of the purpose of the gift tax, which was to supplement the estate tax.</text>
            <text syncTime="1965.490" offset="8002087">And if transfers of wealth are being used in a way that would defeat the applicability of the estate tax or of the income tax, which was also a purpose, then there is more of a problem under the gift tax law than if it's the ordinary kind of consumption of property where the donor could have consumed his estate, obviously, on more frivolous things, but instead he's providing support and tuition benefits for his children, but it's being consumed rather than passed along.</text>

            <text syncTime="2749.295" offset="11137303">I think he does have statutory authority to prescribe at least the method in arriving at the valuation of gifts, including specifying safe harbor rates that would be generally applicable.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="2771.843" offset="11227478">Well, I don't have in the materials before us the provisions of the Code that grant the regulatory authority, but they are in the Internal Revenue Code and they're the same provisions that have authorized the myriad regulations the Commissioner has adopted, including regulations about accounting methods that have to be used in various kinds of business transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2801.778" offset="11347223">There have been different rates specified by the Commissioner in asserting deficiencies in this area, partly reflecting differences in prevailing rates of interest at the time, but also partly reflecting the particular circumstances of the case, because the demand loan varies in its market value depending on the credit status of the borrower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2845.205" offset="11520990">A borrower who may not be in a good position to relay the demand may have to pay a bank considerably more for a demand loan if he's likely not to be able to respond promptly to the demand and come across with the principal, than another borrower who is a better credit risk.</text>
            <text syncTime="2864.619" offset="11598626">And these situations vary in the gift tax cases as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2870.107" offset="11620568">But we do emphasize the breadth of the statutory language Congress used... it's set forth on pages 2 and 3 of our brief... and the comprehensiveness of the 1932 committee reports in adopting that language, referring to the fact that the terms "property", "transfer", "gift", and "directly or indirectly" are used in their broadest and most comprehensive sense, to reach every species of right or interest protected by law and having an exchangeable value.</text>
            <text syncTime="2917.921" offset="11811785">And the right to use this money for as long as the donor permits is a property right in the sense that it's protected by law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2929.461" offset="11857969">If it's deposited by the donee in an interest-bearing account, he has a legal right against the bank or against any other third party to the use of those funds under the terms of the account, and he has a right to the proceeds even against the donor himself, as well as against all properties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2949.875" offset="11939576">So it is a species of property protected by law.</text>

            <text syncTime="3024.007" offset="12236118">The principal is a loan rather than a gift, but the enjoyment in this case is the right to use that money during the time in which the donor doesn't require the principal to be repaid.</text>
