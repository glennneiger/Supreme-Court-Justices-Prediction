            <text syncTime="23.756" offset="232416">This is an appeal from a decision holding that Section 10905 of the Interstate Commerce Act preempts Minnesota condemnation law when that law is applied to property which has been abandoned with ICC approval after the ICC has relinquished all jurisdiction and interest in that line and where a statutorily authorized Minnesota public service corporation seeks to take that line by eminent domain in order to restore rail service to a rural Minnesota community.</text>

            <label>Mr. Robert S. Abdalian</label>
            <text syncTime="79.972" offset="457278">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.994" offset="461353">That is correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.875" offset="468877">The legal issue before this Court has been well defined by the Court of Appeals.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.160" offset="489984">The factual context in which this case comes to this Court is uncomplicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="94.134" offset="513912">CNW, the Appellee, applied to abandon a line of rail that ran from Iowa to Minnesota.</text>
            <text syncTime="102.209" offset="546199">Part of that line is the 19.2 mile segment that lies totally within Minnesota, which has been referred to in all briefs as the Hayfield segment.</text>
            <text syncTime="112.494" offset="587368">The abandonment was contested by a shippers group.</text>
            <text syncTime="116.828" offset="604713">The challenge to the abandonment was unsuccessful.</text>
            <text syncTime="122.853" offset="628746">The abandonment also was challenged by a shippers group in way that the line could avoid abandonment through a procedure within the Commerce Act itself to subsidize the line and keep that line in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.434" offset="691126">The shippers group made an offer of subsidy to continue the line in rail service, and that subsidy offer was not accepted and the Interstate Commerce Commission set a subsidy amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="154.051" offset="753611">The shippers group withdrew their offer of subsidy and the shippers group disbanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.567" offset="783600">Several months later... the abandonment became final in December of 1981.</text>
            <text syncTime="167.572" offset="807633">Several months later the Hayfield Northern was formed, a Minnesota public service corporation with the delegated power of eminent domain to condemn right of way and track for rail use.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.511" offset="863430">Upon the founding of the Hayfield Northern, the Hayfield Northern immediately sought a temporary restraining order in state court in order to keep the line intact, as the Appellee had already commenced procedures to dismantle the track.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.270" offset="930513">The TRO was granted by the state court after a hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.294" offset="946604">The CNW then removed this case to federal district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="206.999" offset="965412">The federal district court dismissed the action with prejudice and dissolved the injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.433" offset="995087">An appeal was immediately taken to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Court of Appeals stayed the order of the district court upon the posting of a bond.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.263" offset="1050467">The Court of Appeals affirmed the district court.</text>
            <text syncTime="232.223" offset="1066245">There are two issues that I wish to emphasize this morning: that is, the difference between pre-abandonment and post-abandonment matters; and that Section 10905 is not the exclusive method in which to transfer property.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.347" offset="1142731">It is common ground in this case and all parties agree that if the State of Minnesota or the Hayfield Northern or any other entity would take any action that would affect a common carrier's status as a common carrier that that would be in conflict with the Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="270.310" offset="1218591">However, by the act of abandonment, the railroad being certified abandoned, the CNW, that points to the end of Interstate Commerce Commission jurisdiction and federal interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.329" offset="1278673">At the point of consummation no longer do we have anything of federal interest, it is a matter of federal indifference, and state power can be exercised on that line, including the power of eminent domain.</text>
            <text syncTime="302.870" offset="1348890">The decision of the Eighth Circuit, if allowed to stand, allows a gap in sovereignty to occur.</text>
            <text syncTime="313.488" offset="1391313">This line of rail is not subject to state power or to federal power or federal interests, and it just exists out there.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.864" offset="1428824">There is a gap.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.074" offset="1433631">It is a no man's land creating a void.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.236" offset="1446379">The Commerce Commission itself has held repeatedly in public rulings that once the certificate of abandonment has issued that is the end of federal interest, and that questions of title to and and disposition of rail property are a matter of state power, a matter of the reserved powers of the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.455" offset="1563198">The decision of the Court of Appeals has thus changed what was considered to be the law by the Interstate Commerce Commission itself, the agency that is in charge of enforcing the Interstate Commerce Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="376.999" offset="1645327">The Court of Appeals found that Section 10905, because there is a provision in which rail property can be transferred, whether that be by subsidy or acquisition and that the Commerce Commission could set a price, that somehow this became the exclusive and only method.</text>
            <text syncTime="396.834" offset="1724739">But the Act itself speaks, Section 10905 speaks, to matters that all happened before abandonment, before the abandonment has been consummated.</text>
            <text syncTime="407.830" offset="1768730">And the title of the Act is particularly instructive.</text>
            <text syncTime="412.124" offset="1785866">It speaks of methods of avoiding abandonment, in avoidance of abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.597" offset="1807809">The Court of Appeals looked at it as the exclusive method to transfer property for continued rail service in connection with abandonment.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.133" offset="1849918">While, that's true, it would be more accurate to say in avoidance of abandonment, and that once the abandonment is final then there is no longer any federal interest that exists, that the states are free to... a state is free to exercise its power.</text>
            <text syncTime="451.057" offset="1941660">There is no reason to subordinate a state interest at that time to that of a private carrier, as there is no federal interest, and the Solicitor General has filed a brief that there is no programmatic interest of the United States that would be adversely affected by the exercise of eminent domain on this line of rail.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.234" offset="2038313">It's consistent--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Robert S. Abdalian</label>
            <text syncTime="494.087" offset="2113755">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.076" offset="2117726">By the act of abandonment it loses its character as interstate rail property.</text>
            <text syncTime="499.561" offset="2135593">It's no longer in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="502.212" offset="2146251">It becomes ordinary mere property, subject to the laws of Minnesota, just like any other property or any other property owner.</text>
            <text syncTime="511.828" offset="2184704">To use the fact that it once was rail property in interstate commerce to shield itself from condemnation is unprincipled.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.977" offset="2241337">The Court of Appeals found that the very tight time constraints in this transfer to subsidy pursuant to Section 10905 would somehow be lost by a state condemnation because you would have protracted condemnation proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.979" offset="2313331">But the 110-day period in which the Commission will set a price and the transfer of the property would take place is not at all affected by the state condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="554.846" offset="2356798">That 110-day period will come to end and that is the end of the federal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="566.012" offset="2401415">It has come to an end and the railroad is able to abandon that property, and that's all that the Commission can... that's the extent of the Commission's authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="577.022" offset="2445510">It has the permissive power to permit the abandonment if the public convenience and necessity permits.</text>
            <text syncTime="584.195" offset="2474140">There is no other power.</text>
            <text syncTime="588.439" offset="2491172">The Commission has not stated by giving the certificate of abandonment that the railroad is entitled to those assets after the certificate issues in any set of circumstances, or that the state power of eminent domain is going to be subordinated to that of the private carrier.</text>
            <text syncTime="605.188" offset="2558150">Once the certificate issues it is at an end.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.164" offset="2586049">And that is consistent with federal policy also, to bring the states to the forefront of restoring rail service.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.529" offset="2619486">We are not, the Hayfield Northern is not, attempting to continue rail service on this line.</text>
            <text syncTime="628.243" offset="2650310">Fail service cannot be continued, which it would be under 10905.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.258" offset="2670372">10905 is a method in which the rail line can continue in service.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.803" offset="2696599">Here service has been discontinued, the community has lost its service, and now a state condemnation wishes not to continue it but to recommended and restore rail service on that line.</text>

            <text syncTime="1032.820" offset="4268648">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1035.021" offset="4277425">Let me briefly summarize the position of the United States in this case and then turn to the issue of opportunity costs that the Appellee has raised in this brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.166" offset="4313997">Our submission is that Section 10905 does not preempt a state's condemnation of a rail line that has been abandoned with the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.815" offset="4356628">ICC authority over abandonments extends up to but not beyond the point that the abandonment becomes effective and the line is no longer a common carrier in the interstate rail system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1068.684" offset="4412113">Section 10905 is part of the federal regulation of carriers in interstate commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.419" offset="4439071">It pertains to pre-abandonment offers of financial assistance and provides an alternative to abandonment in order to furnish continued and uninterrupted service on the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1087.427" offset="4487136">Moreover, the time limits in Section 10905 were intended to expedite the abandonment process of the ICC in order to alleviate the burden on the carrier of providing service until the effective date of the abandonment, which is postponed during the pendency of the Section 10905 offer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1111.072" offset="4581699">Once ICC abandonment approval takes effect, the carrier is free of its federal obligation to maintain service and it can then abandon the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1122.250" offset="4626421">At that point the railroad has obtained what the ICC authorized, its federal service obligation is eliminated and it is relieved of its federal common carrier duties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1135.980" offset="4681278">A subsequent state condemnation proceeding to initiate new service pursuant to a fresh ICC certificate of public convenience and necessity would not interfere with the authorized abandonment or be contrary to the federal policy of expediting abandonments in order to reduce the burden that federal service requirements impose on carriers seeking to abandon a line.</text>
            <text syncTime="1163.686" offset="4792142">And Section 10905 affords no basis whatever to distinguish between former rail property and all other private property in the state that is subject to the traditional power of condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1180.328" offset="4858702">Now, the railroad makes an argument in its brief based on so-called opportunity costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1186.781" offset="4884511">In an abandonment proceeding, one of the factors considered by the ICC is that federal service requirements keep a railroad from using its resources in other more profitable ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1201.531" offset="4943548">This relative economic disadvantage or loss is the opportunity cost that the railroad incurs in connection with the line it seeks to abandon.</text>
            <text syncTime="1213.869" offset="4992867">Appellee contends that a state's post-abandonment condemnation, and especially preliminary injunctive relief incident to that condemnation, restricts the railroad's cause if its track and equipment and thus imposes on the railroad the same opportunity cost that the ICC considered granting the abandonment in the first place.</text>
            <text syncTime="1240.377" offset="5098924">However, the ICC's abandonment approval only determined that, in balancing the competing considerations for and against abandonment under the public convenience and necessity, the need for this service did not justify the costs, including the opportunity costs that such service would impose on the carrier.</text>

            <text syncTime="1602.177" offset="6546108">So there was a balancing of interests of the railroad versus an ability on the part of the local communities via Section 10905 to acquire via forced sale or condemnation--</text>

            <text syncTime="2907.821" offset="11768717">So there was a specific finding in the Commission proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="2955.751" offset="11960351">I believe that the order was one... and that Congress is the one that has established that any forced sale or acquisition of a rail line, an intact rail line for continued rail purposes, should be done under Section 10905.</text>

            <text syncTime="2972.935" offset="12029105">Yes, which it was when the Hayfield Northern obtained the temporary restraining order in state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2978.637" offset="12051884">The ICC, we believe, cannot abdicate its role as guardianship over the railroads' financial condition, and I think it's important to note the primary purposes behind the Staggers Rail Act, which provided for Section 10905, and that was to deregulate the railroad industry and to provide lesser regulatory restraints, but also to give the railroad an opportunity to have the earnings so that it could restore and maintain its rail system and thus provide better rail service for the nation; and then finally, to provide for stability in the rail system of the nation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3021.314" offset="12222620">And Section 10905 as a result was a balancing test to provide this means by which within a certain time period local communities could have the opportunity of acquiring lines and being able to continue service, but at the same time there could not be this protracted delay from letting the railroads reuse their assets productively elsewhere.</text>

            <text syncTime="3058.360" offset="12370787">If there is a reasonable time in which the rail ties and track should be left intact... or not intact; in which the CNW could remove the rail ties, that should have been asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="3076.812" offset="12444661">The Commission should have been asked to put a condition on the abandonment, and that's where that should have been fought out.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.707" offset="12476217">The railroad did not have a condition of the abandonment that they needed the lines and they had to put it elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.742" offset="12508400">The reason that there was no condemnation action or petition for condemnation action brought was because immediately upon seeking the TRO in state court the issue was removed to federal court on a preemption issue, which was perceived as a threshold issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3118.627" offset="12611845">And to bring a condemnation action in state court while this threshold issue had to be decided would be premature and it was likely not to be entertained by the state court in any event pending a resolution of this jurisdictional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3135.481" offset="12679345">As for the estoppel argument of the CNW, estoppel would not prevent the condemnation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.217" offset="12730232">At most it goes to the price that was placed on the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.212" offset="12750189">It's an issue preclusion consideration and not one of preemption.</text>
