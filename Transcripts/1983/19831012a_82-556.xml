            <text syncTime="176.102" offset="852333">The defendant in the case below was found guilty and sentenced to death in connection with a rape and murder.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.021" offset="880023">During the trial, the court closed the proceedings during six weeks of voir dire proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="190.048" offset="908130">The transcript of the six weeks of voir dire was sealed by the court.</text>

            <text syncTime="201.138" offset="952434">On the first occasion, in October of 1981, prior to the commencement of the jury selection process, petitioner made an oral and written motion to allow the public access to the voir dire proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.867" offset="1007396">We did so because we had faced this issue before in other departments of the same court.</text>
            <text syncTime="220.834" offset="1031219">The courts in our county and indeed in the state of California had been closing the courtroom during the voir dire as a result of the case of Hovey versus Superior Court handed down by the California Supreme Court.</text>

            <text syncTime="240.888" offset="1111467">We have had a reference to the possibility of the use of the same procedures in other cases, but we have no knowledge of those instances, Justice Brennan.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.884" offset="1143441">The... We contended then, as we contend now, that the case of Hovey versus Superior Court did not require closure in order to carry out the mandate of the California Supreme Court in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.534" offset="1202060">We argued that to the court on October 19th, 1981, and at the conclusion of the hearing, the court made some comments which appear in the record and in the joint appendix.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.967" offset="1247827">Those comments were generally to the effect that the court believed that the general voir dire should remain open, and that the death-qualifying voir dire should be closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="286.399" offset="1293489">However, the court went on thereafter, after the entreaties of the defense counsel, to indicate that there should be other portions of the voir dire that would possibly be closed.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.755" offset="1346987">The court expanded its thoughts slightly and said that he would conduct individual voir dire with regard to death qualification and</text>
            <text syncTime="307.578" offset="1378230">"any other special areas that counsel may feel some problem with regard to. "</text>
            <text syncTime="313.607" offset="1402367">The court went on to say that regarding individual voir dire, the court</text>
            <text syncTime="319.027" offset="1423996">"reserved jurisdiction to permit something further than death qualification. "</text>
            <text syncTime="324.291" offset="1445103">The court then proceeded to the selection of the jury as indicated with three days, three days of open voir dire and six weeks of closed voir dire.</text>

            <text syncTime="352.904" offset="1559520">The fact of the matter is, counsel's... respondent's brief referred to one case, a case in which we petitioned for cert to this Court, involving selection of a jury involving six months.</text>
            <text syncTime="366.133" offset="1612496">That is the most extensive one that we know of.</text>
            <text syncTime="369.086" offset="1624303">And I might add in that case the voir dire in its entirety was closed, in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="375.441" offset="1649694">However, in that case the transcript was released following the voir dire process.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.160" offset="1668607">At the conclusion of the jury selection in this case, petitioner again filed a written motion with the court, this time requesting the transcript of the closed proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.716" offset="1710821">At the hearing, the court admitted that the responses of the jurors were, to use the court's words, "of little moment".</text>
            <text syncTime="400.291" offset="1749064">But then the court refers to some of the answers being "sensitive" so far as publication is concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="406.961" offset="1775709">At the conclusion of the argument, the court verbalized that</text>

            <text syncTime="412.443" offset="1797652">to use the court's words,</text>

            <text syncTime="417.659" offset="1818550">to use the court's words, was limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.831" offset="1827223">On that basis, petitioner's request for access to the transcript was again refused.</text>

            <text syncTime="472.980" offset="2039859">I think we are not, fortunately or unfortunately, concerned with the utilization or the use of the words "right to know".</text>
            <text syncTime="481.164" offset="2072565">It was a passage utilized by the court during the explanation of its rationale for having closed the courtroom, and I was only referring to its utilization of terms which were perhaps inappropriate in the circumstances, for instance, calling upon a right of privacy, which separately is undefined, or at least ill-defined as it pertains to jurors at this point in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="507.795" offset="2179144">On the third occasion when we tried to secure access, we made an ex parte motion to get the release of the transcript, and once again, the court refused.</text>
            <text syncTime="521.335" offset="2233270">At that time the court indicated that most of the information was "dull and boring", and some of the jurors had, to quote the court,</text>
            <text syncTime="528.957" offset="2263781">"some special experiences in sensitive areas that do not appear to be appropriate for public discussion. "</text>
            <text syncTime="536.127" offset="2292411">When the Court of Appeal in California and the Supreme Court of California refused our petitions, we came to this Court on certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.593" offset="2330236">The voir dire proceedings is, of course, what we are concerned with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="552.588" offset="2358240">The respondent in its briefs has conceded that the voir dire is a part of the trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="558.601" offset="2382272">This acknowledgement by the respondent does not, of course, eliminate the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="563.272" offset="2400976">The trial courts in California have been closing the voir dire, as previously indicated, ignoring the admonitions of this Court regarding the right of access to public proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="575.642" offset="2450504">We feel that it is necessary for this Court to make a firm pronouncement that the principle set forth in Richmond Newspapers, reaffirmed in Gold Newspaper, apply to the proceedings in connection with the selection of the jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="589.137" offset="2504421">We would point to the fact that the voir dire, as with the evidence taking portion of the trial, has been historically an open process.</text>

            <text syncTime="617.844" offset="2619255">The transcript is, at best, a second best alternative.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.749" offset="2630958">Functionally, all of the reasoning of this Court that has been applied to the value of the open trial process applies specifically to the open voir dire process as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.867" offset="2687383">In order for the court below to close the courtroom in such circumstances, of course, the court should have articulated on the record findings that absent closure there was a substantial probability of irreparable harm to a compelling interest, that no less restrictive alternatives to closure were available when closure would effectively protect against the perceived harm.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.343" offset="2777244">Petitioner feels that the remarks of the court and the brief statement in the one written minute order were inadequate to constitute articulated findings in this regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.995" offset="2823846">More particularly, it is our contention that there was no compelling interest which under any circumstances would justify closure in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="678.788" offset="2863030">Respondents advance two rationales.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.317" offset="2877136">One is the Hovey decision, and second, the rights of juror privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.753" offset="2894899">As to the Hovey decision, it is strongly our contention that the Hovey case does not call for closure.</text>
            <text syncTime="695.250" offset="2928963">Hovey versus Superior Court was a decision of the California Supreme Court which, so far as it pertains to these proceedings, involved the interrogation of prospective jurors in a capital case.</text>
            <text syncTime="706.246" offset="2972849">The Hovey mandate was decided based upon a single study by an assistant professor of psychology of a group of some 67 persons who viewed films of simulated voir dire proceedings.</text>

            <text syncTime="738.403" offset="3101476">The study concluded that members of a venire in such a case were impacted by the procedures then in use in California, and there was a tendency to create a predisposition in those jurors towards capital punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="755.708" offset="3170752">Accepting the findings of the psychological study as sound, the California Supreme Court mandated that all courts in the state during the death qualifying questioning of jurors should question those prospective jurors, to use the court's words, "individually and in sequestration".</text>

            <text syncTime="2971.579" offset="12034204">We think that the real issue in this case is whether or not the trial court followed the Richmond standards which have been laid down by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2986.649" offset="12094494">This Court basically set out three criteria, three questions to be asked.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.725" offset="12118840">Did the trial court recognize the right of the public and press to attend the trial?</text>
            <text syncTime="2998.614" offset="12142351">Did the trial court consider alternatives?</text>
            <text syncTime="3001.956" offset="12155725">And finally, were there findings on the record to support the closure?</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.236" offset="12168891">We think it is very clear that the trial court in this particular case did recognize the right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3012.890" offset="12199507">Number One, there was a motion brought by the newspaper which informed the court of that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.856" offset="12219360">In statements made by the court, the court very specifically said, yes, there is a right for the public to know.</text>
            <text syncTime="3024.494" offset="12245900">And so on that first prong we believe the court very clearly satisfied that first prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="3030.897" offset="12271500">Second thing, did the trial court consider alternatives?</text>
            <text syncTime="3035.927" offset="12291667">Once again, although the newspaper did say there were alternatives, the newspaper never offered any alternatives, and we believe a newspaper does at least have a responsibility to at the time that they make their request initially offer some alternatives so that the trial court has the ability to consider them.</text>
            <text syncTime="3054.093" offset="12364287">But we also feel that the trial court in this case did adopt an alternative, which is perhaps the most feasible in protecting everybody's rights, and that is, they allowed questions into areas which would be traditionally governed by the right of privacy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3075.317" offset="12449133">That assured that the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights would be protected.</text>

            <label>Mr. Glenn Robert Salter</label>
            <text syncTime="3090.999" offset="12511931">It represents an alternative because we, Number One, believe that the right to privacy should not be invaded unless there is a compelling state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3102.915" offset="12559578">We are allowing that simply and solely for the very limited purpose of giving the defendant a fair trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3113.006" offset="12599911">But there is no reason that that should be extended or expanded so that the press or the public can delve into those private areas of a person's individual life.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.358" offset="12665322">And if it turns out that there are not areas, that the areas covered were not sensitive, the trial court could then release those questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.337" offset="12713283">The trial court was asked in this case to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3144.617" offset="12726344">The trial court felt that the questions dealt with sensitive areas, invaded the right to privacy, and should not be released to the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="3152.114" offset="12756333">That is very much an alternative to simply saying, no, it is a right to privacy, therefore you cannot ask that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="3160.751" offset="12790919">It allows us to give the defendant, the accused, his Sixth Amendment rights, but it protects the First Amendment rights of both the prospective juror and it does protect in the long run the First Amendment rights of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="3178.432" offset="12861658">Finally, the question is whether or not there were any findings on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3186.381" offset="12893423">We believe once again that there are sufficient findings on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3191.535" offset="12914008">The primary reason for requiring that, as we understand it, is that a reviewing court would have the opportunity of seeing whether or not the trial judge truly considered and balanced the various rights involved, and it is very clear through the arguments made in particular by both the district attorney and by the attorney representing the defendant that all of these arguments were made, the balancing arguments, the privacy arguments, the need for, in this particular case, as to those issues that are sensitive, the need for closure, and that the trial judge then adopted those reasons and the bases for that, and in doing so at that point he decided to partially close.</text>
            <text syncTime="3243.702" offset="13122674">He very clearly stated when they asked to have the transcript released that there was a right to privacy, that it should not be invaded.</text>
            <text syncTime="3253.792" offset="13163111">He recognized the right of the press.</text>
            <text syncTime="3258.211" offset="13180770">He also recognized the rights of the prospective, and in this case the jurors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3263.272" offset="13201041">We feel there are sufficient findings on the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.350" offset="13213267">And as a result, once the trial court satisfied that three-pronged standard of Richmond, we feel the trial court did what he was required to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.972" offset="13255794">The newspaper may not like the decision which was made by the trial court, but the trial court followed the very explicit standards laid down by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.216" offset="13304800">It is our feeling, very clearly, that any case of this nature must be dealt with on a case by case basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.082" offset="13396228">We are not advocating that there be closure in every single case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.705" offset="13418694">We are not advocating that there be closure every time there is voir dire, or any time voir dire extends more than a day.</text>

            <text syncTime="3405.044" offset="13768107">The primary rationale of Hovey does not require closure per se, but when you deal with Hovey on a lengthy basis, you have a lengthy voir dire, I think at that particular point, during the time the voir dire is taking place, it is quite appropriate for the court to close it so that the questions, the responses, the issues which are dealt with do not become part of the record for prospective jurors who might not at that particular point be called.</text>
            <text syncTime="3442.450" offset="13917737">Obviously, on a five-month voir dire it is quite possible that there are people out there who will not have been called at the time the case started but may very well read of the case and read of the responses.</text>
            <text syncTime="3454.039" offset="13964026">So at that point that is very crucial and very important.</text>
            <text syncTime="3458.273" offset="13981058">I do not believe necessarily, but I think the trial court did, that it goes into an area dealing with perhaps the issue of political right to privacy and expressing your views, because obviously the death qualification issue is an emotional argument.</text>
