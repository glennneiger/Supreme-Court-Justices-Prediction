            <text syncTime="70.479" offset="421546">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case involves the validity of an important regulation issued by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.351" offset="493017">The regulation addresses the question of what counts as a "source" for purposes of activating a permit program called the new source review program.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.831" offset="554875">Under the statute, the states must impose new source review in certain areas of the country in situations where construction or modification of a major stationary source of air pollution would lead to significant emissions increases, and the question is: What is a source?</text>
            <text syncTime="126.875" offset="647035">The regulation at issue allows the states... it doesn't compel them... it allows them to adopt a plant-wide definition of the term "source".</text>
            <text syncTime="139.262" offset="696668">This is sometimes called the bubble definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.866" offset="707013">The Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia held that the bubble definition is unlawful; that the administrator has no discretion in how to define "source"; that the statute compels one rigid definition; and we are here asking this Court to correct that holding and to hold that the regulation and the definition fell within the lawful discretion of the administrator.</text>

            <text syncTime="189.714" offset="898438">--with a number of different resolutions of the problem from time to time.</text>
            <text syncTime="194.899" offset="919127">The relevant provisions of the Act, I want to give a little bit of background here to the statutory structure.</text>
            <text syncTime="203.125" offset="952041">They comprise Part D of the Act, and they were passed in '77 to regulate so-called 1977 met the original deadlines for attaining national air quality standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.028" offset="1031662">For these areas, the Congress in '77 adopted a rather elaborately calibrated set of requirements which were designed to achieve three overall goals:</text>
            <text syncTime="236.617" offset="1085997">One was to assure steady progress toward attainment; second, to encourage economic growth through the creation of new plant and equipment even during this period of movement toward attainment; and third, to assure that states should have increased flexibility in organizing their own antipollution strategies.</text>
            <text syncTime="263.135" offset="1192159">These were the three central animating conceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="267.787" offset="1210758">Now Part D is comprised of a complex of provisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.739" offset="1230506">The centerpiece is the obligation on the state to create new state implementation plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.954" offset="1259346">These are the things called SIPs&gt; ["], and these must require annual incremental reductions in emissions which constitute reasonable further progress towards attainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.064" offset="1311800">The statute also requires the SIP to impose what is called "reasonably available control technology" on all existing sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.261" offset="1356626">These requirements have nothing to do with a bubble.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.273" offset="1368642">These are the principal engines that are supposed to drive the state toward attainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.597" offset="1398004">In addition, as one element of the scheme, Part D creates the new source performance, sometimes called NSR... sorry, new source review, NSR program.</text>
            <text syncTime="329.457" offset="1457458">Now this imposes stringent conditions before a permit may be issued to construct new sources of pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.042" offset="1491731">These conditions are very severe.</text>
            <text syncTime="341.505" offset="1505628">For instance, one is a requirement that so-called state of the art, and therefore very expensive, control technology be installed on all new sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.064" offset="1555888">It is this technology that in the trade is sometimes called LAER, or LAER technology.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.437" offset="1585354">Now Part D does not itself define what is a source for purposes of activating this NSR program.</text>
            <text syncTime="371.645" offset="1626209">In fact, the agency has ever since 1977 assumed that it has some discretion in how to define what counts as a source.</text>

            <text syncTime="473.530" offset="2033720">Not always, Your Honor, but in this case there is additional history, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.405" offset="2053155">In this case in the Senate bill that was before the Congress in both '76 and '77, there was an explicit cross-reference to the Section 111 definition of source.</text>
            <text syncTime="492.644" offset="2110206">The Conference Committee removed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.306" offset="2120760">In fact, the Conference Committee rejected the Senate bill and adopted the House approach to new source review.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.940" offset="2147300">The statute as it was enacted did include some explicit cross-references to other Section 111 definitions, but not to the definition of source.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.941" offset="2203306">So we look to that history, and we say there seems to have been at least some indication that Congress did not want to tie the new NSR program to that definition of source.</text>
            <text syncTime="531.740" offset="2266523">And that makes sense to us, Your Honors, because the fact is that the way that definition works in the 1970 NSPS program would be very different... that is, to carry it over would not make much functional sense, because that's a very different program and it operates in a very different way.</text>

            <text syncTime="564.414" offset="2397240">Your Honor, our position is that even if the definition applies, the most sensible reading of it is that within the definition there is room to adapt it, and that the Congress must have intended some administrative discretion to adapt it to the functional needs of the various Clean Air Act programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.237" offset="2484489">An illustration of that would be, there is still another program enacted in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="591.850" offset="2506954">That was the Part C program to prevent deterioration of air quality in areas of the country which had attained national standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.707" offset="2554392">In that program also the agency has said that the bubble definition, even though using the same language as in the Section 111 program, has in that adaptation used the bubble definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.420" offset="2621266">And oddly enough in that context, the Court of Appeals upheld it saying that there is discretion to adapt the definition to meet the various different substantive needs of the various programs.</text>

            <text syncTime="668.141" offset="2812169">It's given a broad scope definition for purposes of structuring the bubble for emissions control, and then it's ignored the word source and referred to emissions units for purposes of engaging lowest achievable emission rate.</text>
            <text syncTime="690.755" offset="2902552">So really EPA has defined source two different ways, it seems to me, within the same section for new source review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1215.920" offset="5003215">The statute first of all says that if you are building something that is less than 100 tons per year, that it's not a major source at all; and under either definition there is no new source review.</text>

            <text syncTime="1235.214" offset="5080433">With respect to modifications, the statute says there has to be a major modification before any of this comes into play.</text>
            <text syncTime="1245.312" offset="5120871">Now the administrator issued regulations interpreting the term "major modifications".</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.148" offset="5152217">That was upheld by the Court of Appeals in the Alabama Power case as lawful.</text>
            <text syncTime="1257.820" offset="5170817">That is, as it were, the source of the significance levels, about which the legality of which I believe there is really no dispute, and which really operate whether you have a bubble definition or a plant-wide definition.</text>
            <text syncTime="1271.551" offset="5225778">That is, under the plant-wide definition, too, it is now the regulatory structure that if you have a modification that, for instance, increases a machine by less than 40 tons per year with respect to one of the pollutants, that the NSR review would not come into play under either definition, whether that is a source or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="1296.755" offset="5326611">I don't believe that there is a dispute between the parties about the legality of the establishment of the significant levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.611" offset="5362033">The relevant authority on that is the Alabama Power case where the Court of Appeals examined this very question and said that, in light of the legislative history, it is inconceivable that Congress should have meant that a very elaborate and very expensive administrative mechanism come into play in the case of trivial changes in emissions levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1330.207" offset="5460358">Of course our submission, Your Honor, is that it is not at all the case that every time there is a change in plant or machinery under the bubble definition that there is going to be any increase whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="1342.326" offset="5508841">The plant definition may very well create reductions in emissions levels.</text>
            <text syncTime="1347.328" offset="5528903">Because if I have a machine that for instance pollutes at 500 now, an existing machine that pollutes say at the level of 500 tons a year, suppose that I want to install a brand new and very efficient new machine that only pollutes at 450.</text>
            <text syncTime="1370.014" offset="5619600">That would be a net decrease in 50.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.946" offset="5635378">Under the bubble definition, NSR would not come into play at all because you have an offset, and therefore I can install the new machine.</text>

            <text syncTime="1511.089" offset="6183950">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, as Mr. Justice Stevens has said, the question in this case is whether the statute defines the term "stationary source" for the purpose of this program, and we contend that it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.379" offset="6241106">Section 110(a)(2)(D) is the key provision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.141" offset="6264093">Section 110(a)(2), as this Court has held in the Train case is what sets forth the mandatory contents of every state plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1539.406" offset="6297217">Subparagraph (D) establishes what each state plan must contain in the way of new source review requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.493" offset="6329504">Subparagraph (D) uses the term "source" twice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1553.106" offset="6351969">One use of that term is explicitly tied to Section 111, and the definition of source in that Section 111 is, a source is a building, a structure, a facility, or an installation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1569.145" offset="6416126">The other use of the term is in a clause not five lines away which requires each state plan to contain a permit program as provided in part (D).</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.563" offset="6457817">The two uses of the term in the same subparagraph ought to be presumed to have the same meaning.</text>
            <text syncTime="1587.598" offset="6490000">That's the only reasonable conclusion, particularly when you look at the legislative history of subparagraph (D).</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.974" offset="6523437">Subparagraph (D) is the result of Congress' having looked at the new source review procedure that was provided in Section... in subparagraph (D) in the 1970 Act, deciding that it was inadequate, that it did not provide for careful review of new sources, and deciding that it needed to be strengthened by creating the permit program that we find in Section 173.</text>
            <text syncTime="1622.742" offset="6630539">It is not credible to suggest that when Congress amended subparagraph (D) in 1977 to add to it the permit program for stationary sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="1637.881" offset="6691143">It meant the term "stationary sources" to mean something new, something different than it already meant in the same subparagraph.</text>
            <text syncTime="1645.858" offset="6723013">Well, having established that the two uses of the term have the same meaning, what is that meaning?</text>
            <text syncTime="1652.261" offset="6748613">Again, as Mr. Justice Stevens has suggested, a term such as building and structure plainly refer to individual industrial units like boilers and blast furnaces, things that actually produce pollution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1666.492" offset="6805560">These terms, we contend, can't reasonably be defined exclusively as entire plants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.338" offset="6840982">The 1977 legislative history, moreover, specifically rules out the bubble definition that EPA has adopted.</text>
            <text syncTime="1685.904" offset="6883195">It explicitly bars a new project from escaping the permit review just by obtaining an offset from within the same plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1694.189" offset="6916319">And I refer you to page 36 of our brief which quotes the statement of Senator Muskie who was chairman of the Senate Conferences, and he was explaining the meaning of the permit program required by the Conference bill to be included in every state plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="1709.139" offset="6976087">He said,</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.601" offset="6981938">", a new source is still subject to such requirements as "lowest achievable emission rate" even if it is used as a replacement for an older facility resulting in a new reduction from previous emission levels. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.939" offset="7039303">He was there explicitly referring to the situation where someone takes a facility in a plant, retires it, and replaces it with a new one, a new boiler or blast furnace.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.746" offset="7090608">And he said, you're still subject to permit review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1740.788" offset="7102729">You cannot net out of the permit review simply by getting an offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="1745.212" offset="7120387">Now the reasons why Congress was not satisfied with just an offset that keeps the pollution from increasing are plain in the requirements and purposes of Section 173.</text>
            <text syncTime="1759.662" offset="7178275">In enacting that section, Congress made it clear that it wasn't enough just to keep pollution from increasing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.267" offset="7204606">First, pollution had to be made to decrease.</text>
            <text syncTime="1770.609" offset="7222056">The offset that's required in Section 173(1) is an offset which is more than equal to the pollution that the new boiler is going to add.</text>

            <text syncTime="2063.384" offset="8393073">If, for example, in your hypothetical that the application of the advanced technology meant that the boiler would increase pollution by 400 instead of by 500 tons, then the offset would be correspondingly less and, to the extent that you had used up some opportunity for reduction, just to stay even with the new boiler, the state could use that reduction opportunity to make further progress towards the standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2092.953" offset="8511355">So if you have poorly controlled new sources coming in, then just staying even requires going deeper into the well of offset opportunities, and it makes it even harder to meet the health standards or the deadlines which Congress has required they be met by.</text>
            <text syncTime="2110.575" offset="8581886">So a great deal is being given up when a major source is left out of the permit process.</text>

            <text syncTime="2139.803" offset="8698810">Because the statistics that we have put forth, which no one in this case contests, are that almost every major project built in a polluted area is built within a plant, not at a new site.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.574" offset="8769863">And in almost every case, they have shown themselves to be able to get their offset.</text>

            <text syncTime="2236.458" offset="9085422">And the third reason is to serve the purpose of advancing technology of improving the rate at which it's developed and deployed on new sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.543" offset="9125755">All of those things are lost if lowest achievable emission rate technology is not applied to these 90 percent of the major projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.340" offset="9156893">The third requirement is the requirement to demonstrate compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.552" offset="9181762">I refer you to page 39 of our brief again.</text>
            <text syncTime="2264.175" offset="9196286">The House report language... the House report passages discussed there are ones in which the House had found that there was an alarming level of noncompliance with the law in 1975 and 1976, and they sought to create a new incentive to comply by making someone who wanted to build a new source responsible for demonstrating that he was complying with the law with the sources that he already owned.</text>
            <text syncTime="2293.845" offset="9314986">These are important purposes which are rendered unachieved completely if nothing applies, if not of these projects fall under the definition of source and therefore under the permit requirement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.195" offset="9376322">It is a cardinal principle of statutory construction that an agency can't rewrite a definition to subvert specific statutory requirements that were adopted to serve specifically articulated congressional purposes, yet under this definition all three of the important purposes Congress intended Section 173 to serve are frustrated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2332.009" offset="9467646">Now I want to amplify on an aspect of Justice White's question of a few moments ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2344.938" offset="9519369">The government has suggested in its briefs that it doesn't make any difference if all these things are lost, provided that there is a plan which will on paper at least project meeting the deadlines... meeting the standards by the deadlines of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="2364.851" offset="9598990">Congress has clearly decided that it's not enough to have a plan that projects progress and attainment by the deadlines.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.328" offset="9644861">It has established a two-track system which doesn't put all of its eggs in one basket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2381.804" offset="9666804">In 1970, and again in 1977, Congress specifically chose not to put total reliance on that plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.919" offset="9699300">The history of the Act shows that that was a wise judgment, because the plans alone don't work sufficiently to meet the standards on time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2401.475" offset="9745484">In the early '70s under the obligation to develop a plan to meet the standards by 1975, every state submitted a plan which it projected would do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2412.432" offset="9789266">But when the '75 deadline passed, although there had been progress, two-thirds of the nation's people still lived in areas that didn't meet health standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.788" offset="9826777">In 1977, Congress called for a new round of plans to meet the deadlines by 1982.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.773" offset="9858647">But by the end of 1982, there were still more than 100 major metropolitan areas which don't meet the health standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.131" offset="9892084">The projection of attainment all by itself is useful but not reliable all by itself, and that's why it's backed up by specific requirements that apply to major stationary sources.</text>
            <text syncTime="2452.900" offset="9951225">It seems to me a novel proposition that by complying with one of those three conditions, albeit only partly the offset condition, something which otherwise would be a source, it's a thing by itself that emits the requisite amount of pollution is not a source at all anymore and can forget entirely about the other conditions that would normally... that it would normally be subject to.</text>

            <text syncTime="2501.480" offset="10145471">--in situations where there is no state plan, that even on paper purports to provide a method for getting to the standards on time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2511.637" offset="10186118">And that situation is the construction moratorium situation, and also EPA's offset ruling, two situations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2522.416" offset="10229272">Both of those apply in situations where the state either has not yet written the plan, or is overdue for writing the plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2530.684" offset="10262291">What EPA has said there is that it's okay to use a definition which lets 90 percent of the projects which would otherwise be subject to the moratorium escape the moratorium, regardless of whether they may increase pollution, and in spite of the fact that they're not even being built with lowest achievable emission rate technology and with a certification by the source builder that its other sources are meeting the requirements applicable to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2564.494" offset="10397605">So in that case, the government doesn't even have the fig leaf of protection from the requirement that the state have a plan that promises to meet the standards on time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2577.794" offset="10450791">One final argument that I'd like to mention that the Government makes is that, on the assumption that it has some discretion in this area, on the assumption that the statute doesn't require coverage of these major units, the government is arguing that its definition actually makes things better.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.403" offset="10561236">And the argument for that case is that, they say, that the older definition which EPA had for 10 years, which covered the units, might discourage in some instances the replacement of a project which might be cleaner than the thing that it was replacing.</text>

            <text syncTime="2653.322" offset="10752871">And in the 10 prior years, we had the units being covered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2657.236" offset="10768544">In fact, in 1976 EPA established the offset ruling... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2667.861" offset="10811071">I would like to return to a question about the law for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2672.666" offset="10830297">One of the government's arguments is that a provision explicitly incorporating the unit definition was dropped from the Senate bill in the 1977 Conference Committee.</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.298" offset="10900724">In order to make that argument work, that the dropping of that Section 302(m) was meaningful and was intended to exclude... to drop the unit definition, have to be able to show that the House bill coming to the Conference intended something different than the Senate bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2711.409" offset="10985256">And I believe we can show that the House bill covered units just as much as the Senate bill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2718.706" offset="11014409">The House bill provided for new source review by adopting into the law EPA's 1976 regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2727.430" offset="11049308">EPA's 1976 regulations specifically provided that every building, structure, facility, or installation which emits more than 100 tons was subject to this review process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2740.440" offset="11101344">So the House came into the Conference with a unit-specific definition; the Senate came in with a unit-specific definition; they conferenced their language to conform it into what we see in the final law; and at the end of the Conference Senate Muskie went back and explained to his colleagues that the bubble was not allowed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2762.964" offset="11191414">I think in that legislative history context it is not credible to claim that Congress left open the question whether units like boilers and blast furnaces were covered by the permit requirements.</text>

            <text syncTime="2849.601" offset="11538007">And EPA had done that by adopting a definition that included the phrase "or combination thereof", combination of the buildings, and structures, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.277" offset="11576668">And the Court of Appeals said you can't do that; you're restricted to those four words, but we think that it would be reasonable for you to define "facility" or "installation" not only as a unit but as a plant, too.</text>

            <text syncTime="2885.634" offset="11682098">--What it requires is that if you are building a bunch of small units at the same time, or you're adding a small unit, one that is not by itself large enough to qualify as a major source... i.e., by itself it's not a 100-ton emitter... then the only way EPA can subject that thing to new source review is by virtue of making it a modification of the whole plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2910.040" offset="11779692">And if the only way it is subject to new source review is by virtue of it being a modification of the whole plant, then you ought to... then the symmetry of it is that you have to let the plant owner get an offset within the plant in order to eliminate the net increase in its plant's emissions.</text>
            <text syncTime="2932.844" offset="11870911">If that unit by itself is major in size, it does emit more than 100 tons, or in the case of that other program it's a higher level of 250 tons, but if those thresholds are crossed, that thing, that boiler is subject to review all on its own, regardless of whether it's located on a greenfield site or in a plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2956.780" offset="11966729">But even if Alabama Power is rightly interpreted as mandating a plant-wide definition for the program to limit how much worse pollution can get where it's currently better than the standards, it is not consistent with the purpose of reducing pollution to let sources which it applies in this program, to let these big projects escape from all the pollution reducing requirements that are found in Section 173.</text>
            <text syncTime="2991.554" offset="12105804">So to the extent the distinction means that when the program is to reduce pollution it's not legal to let these sources out of it, it's right.</text>

            <text syncTime="3190.693" offset="12902330">I don't think, if that's all he was saying, that it makes any difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3194.326" offset="12916854">But we think the most fundamental point here is that Congress was trying to balance a number of different problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.081" offset="12951858">It found the '70 statute to be deficient because it did not sufficiently balance the problem of renewal and growth with the problem of achieving attainment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.781" offset="13002745">Congress said, we want a different scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="3219.352" offset="13016955">So everything that Mr. Doniger says about the fact that ever since 1971 this is the way it was defined, we have here Congress saying we really want to take a slightly different path.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.879" offset="13063140">We want the states to have added flexibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.871" offset="13075052">And we have particularly in mind the problem of disincentives to growth.</text>
            <text syncTime="3239.734" offset="13098562">The bubble idea has behind it a very simple and elegant idea, which is: That you will have incentives to growth if you allow industry the flexibility to spend its pollution dollars in the most efficient rather than the least efficient way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.989" offset="13179542">If you can reduce pollution by spending a million dollars on machine A, that is a better idea than requiring you to spend two million dollars on having the same reduction by making you do it on machine B.</text>
            <text syncTime="3276.900" offset="13247146">If I have a machine that is a very efficient machine and I want to double its capacity and that will create 200 new tons of pollution, it may cost a million dollars to put LAER on that to bring that 200 back down and to eliminate the 200.</text>
            <text syncTime="3297.013" offset="13327604">But I might be able to get rid of the 200 simply by eliminating the next machine, which is an inefficient machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.168" offset="13360204">Now Mr. Doniger's whole argument is that if we insist on LAER on the new machine and eliminate the old machine, we will get rid of 400 units.</text>
            <text syncTime="3316.594" offset="13405971">But you have created a one million dollar extra cost on the expansion of your efficient machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3330.195" offset="13460410">The choice isn't between the new machine with LAER or the new machine with LAER, because the antecedent question is whether the plant will put in the new machine.</text>
            <text syncTime="3339.030" offset="13495728">That is, the question is on the incentives to renew at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.504" offset="13517566">Under the source definition, under the tight definition that Mr. Doniger puts before you, we have the antecedent question: Will there be renewal at all?</text>
