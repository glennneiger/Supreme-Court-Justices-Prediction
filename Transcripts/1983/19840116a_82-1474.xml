            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="144167">I think you may proceed whenever you are ready, Mr. Hoover.</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles R. Hoover</label>
            <text syncTime="28.317" offset="257434">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="31.119" offset="268614">I believe it is very important for us to keep in mind exactly what this case is about, because many items in the brief deal with issues that are not really here.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.708" offset="306962">I think Judge Ferguson, in the Court of Appeals in the dissent, very distinctly put it in the beginning of that, that this is, in effect, a case dealing with the subject of a male person who has been judicially determined to be mentally unable to engage in the practice of law in the State of Arizona, may still maintain a $2,200,000 damage action under the Federal antitrust laws against the Committee on Examination and Admission of the Arizona Supreme Court for failing to give him a passing grade on the state bar examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.262" offset="437156">Looking at what the case is about, we are here contending that on at least four principal bases we should prevail, that is the committee members should not be subject to this kind of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.272" offset="489192">Three of those are state action items.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.788" offset="499223">The first is that we contend that we are involved in state action as the state, as the sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.128" offset="524614">Secondly, failing that particular test in your view, that we are involved in state action as a subdivision of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.400" offset="561708">Thirdly, failing that, that we would be involved in state actions as a private party, although we do concur with the amicus position of the United States that that is not the case here, we are not private parties, although we certainly that they meet those tests... that we meet those tests.</text>
            <text syncTime="120.159" offset="624716">Fourthly, that if there is no state action involved at all, then the Noerr-Pennington doctrine would apply insofar as antitrust matters are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.099" offset="660556">The principal basis of the state action doctrine, as an exemption from the antitrust laws, is federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.288" offset="701307">I think something again ought to be kept in mind that taking the case as it is, as a pleadings case, and assuming that the members of the committee did all of the wrongful things that either the complaint alleges or that the briefs infer, the federal antitrust laws are not the basis upon which to redress this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.372" offset="797646">There are plenty of remedies available to Mr. Ronwin, to anyone in Mr. Ronwin's position, to in effect have his day in court, to have his merits as a lawyer determined, to have his claim in effect adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="181.067" offset="868386">In fact, we contend he has done just that by virtue of the fact that his admissions, on the very issues that we are talking about, have previously been determined by the State of Arizona.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.458" offset="917914">In other words, these facts were presented to them, and they have been brought to this Court, not once, but he has gone to the State of Arizona on three different occasions and been turned down, and to this Court, from those three different occasions, on four different writs of certiorari in addition to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.384" offset="985623">So it is not a situation where we are dealing with any man's rights that have not had a fair chance to be adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="217.823" offset="1015403">This is a case where we are dealing with what very chilling effect on state or state officers, state officials, you have by subjecting them to the pressures and the difficulties of facing a trial on merits and facts for some underlying purposes or reasons under the antitrust laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.956" offset="1107981">Our view basically is that under Parker versus Brown, which to us is the heart of the case, in fact that this is very much the heart of the case--</text>

            <label>Justice John Paul Stevens</label>
            <text syncTime="250.644" offset="1146642">Mr. Hoover, may I ask you, assuming, and I know you, of course, deny the allegations in the complaint, but assume that the examiners did not set the exam schedules on the basis of competence to practice law, but they wanted to set the figure so low that very few new lawyers would be admitted to protect the existing bar from the competition of too many lawyers in the community, and the Plaintiff wanted to challenge that practice, which I assume may not well happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="281.164" offset="1268791">If he wanted to challenge such a practice, how should he do it other than by the antitrust laws?</text>

            <label>Mr. Charles R. Hoover</label>
            <text syncTime="297.858" offset="1335560">How does he do that; exactly the way he did it, and exactly the way that a case, the Met-Coal case, challenged a state statute in California, that is through some other proceeding in the state courts saying, look, the state should give me a license to practice, and if the method by which I am trying to get there is improper because of a violation of the antitrust laws, then I ought to get my license.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.239" offset="1433049">That is exactly an issue that he presented in May of 1974 to the Arizona Supreme Court, and they denied it, and he brought the case here on a writ of certiorari and in doing so, he took the very same basis... the very same basis that he contended was the basis of the antitrust claim.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.839" offset="1527507">Although he did not present the antitrust claim to this Court in August of 1974, he brought these same grounds here in a writ of certiorari and he said--</text>

            <text syncTime="377.226" offset="1653000">And, yes, ultimately, res judicata could dispose of this case, but here is the method by which somebody should raise these issues in a system of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.249" offset="1685078">He said that the lack of a preset standard and failure to grade petitioner on his own legal abilities, unrelated to those of the particular group taking the exam at the same time as Petitioner, constituted a denial of due process and equal protection to Petitioner in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="403.227" offset="1757071">That is in August of 1974 on a writ of certiorari to this Court, which was denied.</text>

            <text syncTime="558.978" offset="2380040">From those nominations, the committee selected a commission... excuse me, selected a committee, which then made a recommendation to the commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="569.452" offset="2421940">We have a very similar situation here, only it's a higher level item, the Supreme Court, from a list of nominees from the state bar, selects a committee that makes a recommendation to the committee.</text>

            <text syncTime="853.754" offset="3559103">Taking the pleadings as they are in this situation, the point that we contend is state action, when done by the state, is that you only need to have a clearly articulated state policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="867.077" offset="3612392">That is that the state policy is one which displaces competition with a form of regulation, and when you do that, by definition when you exclude somebody, you will have an anti-competitive effect if those people going to the marketplace have a competitive effect.</text>

            <text syncTime="887.391" offset="3693685">Therefore, the state action comes by the fact that we are doing something that says, here we make a determination and we made a decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="898.133" offset="3736631">This is why I emphasized the point earlier that if we were wrong in that, there are other ways for him to have redress, and that you should not put a very chilling effect on state officers in trying to decide these issues by saying, fine, you are going to be subject to very substantial triple damages to be for, apparently, personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="923.600" offset="3838508">In other words, there is an excellent article written by Professor Areeda in 95 Harvard Law Review, 435, which I commend to you, and we cite it in our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="934.306" offset="3881349">I think he very clearly points that out when dealing with the subdivision of the state point, the same thing that we are discussing here, and that is that once you start looking behind the authorizations, once you start looking at what might be motives even, because this is apparently what this would lead to, and certainly the court and the law in that case rejected the idea that you look at the motives of the people functioning here.</text>
            <text syncTime="958.087" offset="3976435">When you start doing that, you put the state officer in the position of saying, Gee, I had better be very careful that I don't tread on somebody, because if I do and he is displeased, I'm going to have to face being sued in a triple damage action.</text>

            <text syncTime="1609.936" offset="6583873">No, I don't think we should be deviating from state policy, but if we are not subject to the state action exemption, then what we are doing is clearly covered by Noerr-Pennington, because we are making a recommendation to the state that is ultimately the authority, the supreme court, that somebody be or not be admitted.</text>

            <text syncTime="1655.584" offset="6766417">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1662.404" offset="6793689">One question was the rules in effect, in the reply brief, the petitioners are arguing that the rules that we are arguing about are not rules of "pleadings practice and procedure".</text>
            <text syncTime="1676.498" offset="6850113">But I recommend that if you read these rules which are attached, I believe, to the first petition for a rehearing in the Ninth Circuit by petitioners, you will find that they deal precisely with pleadings practice in this judicial proceeding of determination of how you get into the bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="1697.994" offset="6936108">They tell you how to challenge the grades, how to challenge any other part of the examination, et cetera.</text>
            <text syncTime="1704.815" offset="6963380">They are clearly pleadings practice rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1707.117" offset="6972575">The Arizona Supreme Court simply did not follow its own rule on how to amend its rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="1713.521" offset="6998175">Secondly, the standard, whether we take Mr. Hoover's idea of what the rules are or mine, the standard was nevertheless 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="1724.562" offset="7042374">They preset a standard of 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.513" offset="7050211">I aver in the complaint that they told us before the exam that 70 was the passing grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.684" offset="7074871">They admit in their answer, at paragraph 3, they admit that, yes, we told them that 70 was the passing grade.</text>
            <text syncTime="1741.190" offset="7108830">They are attempting in the reply brief now to deny that that's allegation of a preset 70.</text>
            <text syncTime="1749.796" offset="7143311">It seems to me that if you tell people before an exam that 70 is the passing grade, you are presetting the standard.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.950" offset="7167867">So I think that they are in error in that attempt.</text>

            <text syncTime="1806.513" offset="7370159">Arizona did not, as petitioners claim, "replace competition with regulation" by creating the scheme to measure competence of bar applicants, that is, by creating a scheme to examine them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.173" offset="7424807">What they did there was create a scheme simply to determine who was qualified from who was not qualified.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.677" offset="7454796">But they did not tell the bar examiners to determine the numbers that are to be admitted as a result of the examination.</text>

            <text syncTime="1856.945" offset="7571929">They used the examination, the grading system so as to determine the numbers to be allowed, rather than to determine competence by the way they did it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.820" offset="7611426">They may not have even been aware that they were doing it because it was kind of a complicated mathematical scheme this scale scoring business.</text>
            <text syncTime="1874.890" offset="7643713">So they might have been unaware of what they were doing, but that's what they were doing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1879.960" offset="7663984">When I told them so, they said, Ronwin, you are not mentally and physically able to practice law.</text>

            <text syncTime="1929.643" offset="7862724">See, if they were going to grade on the 70 scale, Your Honor, then they would be grading each examination somewhere between zero and 100 each question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1939.166" offset="7900758">Then at the end they'd have a bunch of questions with 55, 75, or 95, and then whatever system they wanted to use.</text>
            <text syncTime="1946.772" offset="7931165">Mayb they wanted to give one question double weight, another question single weight, that would be up to them.</text>

            <text syncTime="1991.051" offset="8108275">--I know they deliberately graded the way they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.038" offset="8136278">Now it's for the court to decide just how purposeful it was, I think.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.976" offset="8168043">I want to point out that first there's a question of what test should apply, and I had urged Met-Cal in the brief, which has got the two prongs, the clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed prong, and the supervision prong.</text>
            <text syncTime="2024.438" offset="8241917">I wish to point out that the petitioners have relied heavily on being state agents and state officials.</text>
            <text syncTime="2031.109" offset="8268562">But as this court has said itself in Golfarb, being an agency for limited purposes doesn't create an antitrust shield when they use their powers for anti-competitive benefit of their members.</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.018" offset="8320180">Likewise, in City of Lafayette, Met-Cal, and I think in Boulder, too, the court has said that being a state agent or official is not a per se exemption from Sherman Act liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2053.791" offset="8359259">As far as just what kind of a test, the reason both the petitioner just indicated that he agrees with the clearly articulated prong, but the supervision is needed, I think, for this reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.484" offset="8418087">If you don't have the supervision, then it will not... you are not certain that the sovereign is the one who has declared the clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed requirement, because part of that clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed requirement is that it be the sovereign declare it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.964" offset="8495932">These people are not the sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2089.714" offset="8502933">If you keep making the sovereign larger than you have now, its legislature and supreme court, then this could go down to no one knows where.</text>
            <text syncTime="2100.355" offset="8545565">If you have a good cut-off point, they are not sovereign.</text>
            <text syncTime="2102.974" offset="8556014">Therefore, I suggested as a supervision... Of course, you don't watch everything they do, but when a board, a state board takes an action where they... where they know or ought to know that this action is going to be anticompetitive in an economic sense, then it seems to me they have a duty to report to the sovereign, whether it is the legislature or, in this case, the Arizona Supreme Court, and get that court to declare clearly, a clear articulation and a firm expression, yes, we approve this new type of action that you are taking.</text>
            <text syncTime="2139.413" offset="8701777">That is why you need supervision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2141.099" offset="8708464">It doesn't have to be watching every pencil that they push.</text>
            <text syncTime="2144.134" offset="8720689">Lastly, I also indicated I think you should add something to the test and that is the states, the sovereign units ought to justify why they are engaging in this anticompetitive activity, because you have called this, the Sherman Act, the Magna Carta of free competition.</text>
            <text syncTime="2164.028" offset="8800206">You know that it is an ideological linchpin in our argument with the Eastern bloc.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.349" offset="8825493">What's more, a congressional statute is being overridden by state action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2175.336" offset="8845450">It seems to me that when those factors are involved, certainly the state sovereign units ought to justify either by a compelling interest or by a rationally related interest why they are replacing competition with some anticompetitive scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.584" offset="8926430">Scale scoring, as I indicated before in my brief and as you find in those statistics I give in the appendix, it certainly doesn't equalize anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="2209.243" offset="8981078">Had they stuck, I think, with a reasonable... with the 70 standard, they probably would have experienced about... a much higher pass rate at the time I took the exam.</text>
            <text syncTime="2219.432" offset="9021829">I also want to indicate that the Feldman case was raised, and I don't think that it is applicable here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2225.019" offset="9044190">No judgment of the Arizona Supreme Court is being attacked.</text>

            <text syncTime="2313.158" offset="9396738">Scale scoring automatically, as they admit, rests on taking the group's achievement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2319.562" offset="9422338">Therefore, I think you violate the Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendment when you use any kind of a game of that sort.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.799" offset="9443341">Lastly, I would like to raise one point with this court, which I didn't raise in the briefs, and others haven't raised it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2331.636" offset="9470613">I think all members of the court, as well as the petitioner, the amicus and myself originally thought the state action exemption was a perfectly legal doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.808" offset="9507393">I thought about whether it was or not because in my brief I have this notion about overriding a statute of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2346.729" offset="9531008">I have come to the conclusion, and I hope perhaps you'll agree with me, that is is unconstitutional, because I think you did in effect was this.</text>
            <text syncTime="2354.566" offset="9562355">You say it in Parker and you say it in Boulder, that the reason you have the state action exemption is in the interest of federalism.</text>
            <text syncTime="2362.322" offset="9593388">Federalism comes out of the Tenth Amendment, basically, and that prohibits the states from doing whatever is prohibited in the rest of the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2371.277" offset="9629228">We have a supremacy clause which prohibits the states from overriding a statute of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2377.514" offset="9654201">Another justification, perhaps, is that the Sherman Act does not apply to the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.235" offset="9677085">I think that doesn't give you the concomitant right to declare that the states can therefore take actions which override the Sherman Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.524" offset="9714178">If it doesn't apply, that ends it, it doesn't apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2396.143" offset="9728703">But there is no lawful right, you see, to then let the states through this "state action exemption" override a statute of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.034" offset="9772275">That result has been that you have amended the Constitution by the State action doctrine, and Article Five of the Constitution does not allow this court to have any say in the amendment process.</text>
            <text syncTime="2420.610" offset="9826505">In fact, not even Congress, I think, has the right to allow a state to override its own statute because that again would be an amendment of the supremacy clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2429.197" offset="9860882">Only after two-thirds vote and three-fourth ratification by the states can you get that done.</text>
            <text syncTime="2434.501" offset="9882094">I thought I would throw that out for the consideration of the court because I'm sure it would want to consider the lawfulness of the state action exemption itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2444.041" offset="9920232">Thank you.</text>

            <label>Mr. Lawrence G. Wallace</label>
            <text syncTime="2470.876" offset="10027648">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2477.030" offset="10052203">Whether the complaint in this case should have survived the motion to dismiss is the procedurally narrow question before the court, but in the view of the United States a somewhat broader perspective than the immediately presented context of bar examinations helps to illuminate the proper resolution of that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2506.216" offset="10169023">It is not uncommon for the states to have dozens of boards or commissions with authority to license or to regulate particular trades or professions, and these boards are often comprised, as in this case, exclusively or predominantly of individuals who are themselves engaged in the trade being regulated.</text>
            <text syncTime="2537.568" offset="10294410">Some of these boards pose dangers of the imposition of guild type restrictions on competition that quite frankly are of considerably more significance to our competitive economy than the question whether an artificially reduced additional number of lawyers was admitted to practice after a particular bar examination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2571.925" offset="10431814">In recent years, the enforcement activities of the United States in this area have focused primarily on rules adopted by these boards prohibiting competitive bidding, or prohibiting advertising, or otherwise restricting methods of solicitation of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.726" offset="10535050">One of these enforcement actions of the Federal Government has resulted in a reported case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2605.813" offset="10567338">It was an action that we brought against the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy which had adopted a rule that a public accountant shall not make a competitive bid for professional services.</text>
            <text syncTime="2622.858" offset="10635569">That rules was restrained by the District Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2626.210" offset="10648944">The decision was upheld by the Fifth Circuit, reported at 592 F. 2nd 919, and this court denied certiorari at 444 U.S. 925.</text>
            <text syncTime="2641.220" offset="10709026">We have brought a similar action against the Mississippi State Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors in which cross-motions for summary judgment are being held in abeyance pending the decision in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.751" offset="10795125">We also filed a civil antitrust suit against the Alaska Board of Registration for Architects, Engineers, and Land Surveyors, which also had adopted a competitive bidding ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="2677.345" offset="10853535">We have negotiated a consent decree in that case which will require elimination of that ban.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.284" offset="10889271">We have filed in April of last year a civil antitrust suit against the State Board of Certified Public Accountants of Louisiana which had adopted a rule restricting advertising and solicitation, and that case is scheduled to go to trial later this month.</text>
            <text syncTime="2709.816" offset="10983416">The cases that have actually been filed represent only a part of the enforcement activities we have engaged in in this area.</text>
            <text syncTime="2721.957" offset="11031899">Many times, our investigations have led to the rescission of rules of this kind.</text>
            <text syncTime="2730.028" offset="11064187">For example, in 1982, the West Virginia Board of Accountancy rescinded bans on competitive bidding and solicitation when it became apparent that we would file suit if they did not do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="2745.739" offset="11127089">Now, all of the rules that I have just referred to were adopted pursuant to general enabling statutes which authorized these boards to adopt rules to further professional ethics, and otherwise gave neutrally phrased authority to the boards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2774.407" offset="11241715">But there is also a danger that more specific statutory authority to deny licenses or to prohibit practices for statutorily specified purposes can be distorted into anti-competitive uses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2795.755" offset="11327187">We gave one hypothetical example in our brief of a board to determine whether restaurants meet health and sanitation requirements, and the possibility that it might for anti-competitive reasons refuse to license a restaurant even though it had no basis for thinking that there was any health or sanitation problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.120" offset="11424572">Another example might be hypothesized from the face of the Maryland statutes dealing with savings and loan regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.980" offset="11487997">The State of Maryland has filed an amicus brief in this case taking a position similar to ours.</text>
            <text syncTime="2842.284" offset="11513284">One of the things provided in their statute is that a board of savings and loan association commissioners, consisting of a majority of members engaged in the business, will monitor, and approve or disapprove certain kinds of new practices proposed by institutions practicing in that field in order to determine whether the innovation proposed might undermine the financial stability of the particular savings and loan.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.409" offset="11665734">One could see the temptation that there might be in a board of that sort to reject a competitive innovation by a competitor in the field even though there was no basis for thinking that that innovation would in any way undermine the financial stability of that competitor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2905.659" offset="11766776">These hypothetical possibilities and the real cases that we have brought are a bit reminiscent of one of this court's classic antitrust decisions that in the Fashion Originators Guild case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2925.807" offset="11847338">The difference is that unlike the situation in Fashion Originators Guild there is no need to aggregate the market power and to exercise that power, if power conferred by the state on a group of people in the business can be distorted into anti-competitive uses.</text>

            <text syncTime="3009.625" offset="12182645">The petitioner is arguing that the remedies must be restricted to remedies under state procedures and in the state courts, but that argument seems to me foreclosed by the court's decision in the City of Boulder which upheld an antitrust complaint for an injunction where the charge was that restraint of trade was undertaken by public officials and was not pursuant to a policy adopted by the state sovereign.</text>

            <text syncTime="3141.444" offset="12709901">That is our point in viewing the issues presented in this case in perspective.</text>
            <text syncTime="3151.400" offset="12749711">The mere fact that this is a board of public officials does not mean that all of their activities ipso facto are immune from antitrust regulation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3169.527" offset="12822227">That seems to us to follow a fortiori from the decision in the City of Boulder because if that was true of elected officials responsible for the general welfare of the community alleged to be acting in conformity with the state statute, it has to be true for these part-time public officials alleged to be acting contrary to the mandate given the by a state statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="3200.566" offset="12946361">The dissenting judge in the court below distinguished the City of Boulder case on the ground that city officials could be more parochial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.021" offset="12992232">But from the standpoint of antitrust concerns there is a greater parochialism in a group of public officials composed of individuals with a common economic interest than the fact that there may be a geographically restricted point of view about the general public welfare.</text>
            <text syncTime="3238.422" offset="13097767">There is a clearly stated state policy that the board here claims to be following and that is to administer a bar examination that measures for competence and to report to the state supreme court who demonstrated competence on that examination and who did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="3266.758" offset="13211138">And, if objectively looked at, what the board did in any way reasonably furthers that policy, then they have performed within the immunity in our view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3284.137" offset="13280624">We do not regard it as a proper inquiry for the courts to determine what their motivations were, so long as their actions objectively fell within that grant of authority that is a restraint that had to be contemplated and authorized by the state supreme court in conferring discretion on the board to act anywhere within that range of authority.</text>
            <text syncTime="3318.458" offset="13417924">But the allegation in the complaint here is that they imposed an artificial limit on the number who could pass the exam in a manner unrelated to competence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3332.967" offset="13476020">It seems to us that that is an allegation that they went beyond the specifically articulated state policy, and an allegation that has to withstand a motion to dismiss the complaint, even though it is quite possible that a case like this can be resolved at the summary judgment stage, without an extensive trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3363.005" offset="13596183">The fact that the report that they make to the state supreme court is in the form of a recommendation, seems to us to be a formal distinction from other licensing boards that really does not preclude the possibility of the imposition, through distorting the state given authority, the imposition of a trade restraint of some significance to antitrust policy, if they know that the report that they have been asked to give will generally be followed, and that report seems to be a report on who demonstrated competence and who did not, but has actually been used for other purposes, and that is what the complaint alleges.</text>

            <text syncTime="3439.070" offset="13900353">I committed to you earlier Professor Areeda's article, and let me read to you the last sentence of that particular article.</text>
