            <text syncTime="54.818" offset="361356">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="57.853" offset="373476">This matter comes to the Court from an appeal from the Third Circuit.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.323" offset="391344">The facts in the case are not in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="66.108" offset="406495">Basically it is a simple legal issue that is presented here today.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.012" offset="426139">Simply put the question is one of whether an individual who has initially filed a fraudulent tax return and subsequently comes forth and files an amended tax return, whether by that act he begins the running of the three-year statute of limitations applicable under the Internal Revenue Code or, as the government alleges, he is forever open to an assessment of tax upon the filing of the initial fraudulent return.</text>

            <text syncTime="103.983" offset="558005">Where would your argument take you if when the amended return was offered, tendered, the Commissioner refused to accept it?</text>

            <text syncTime="114.256" offset="599070">I think, Your Honor, under that point the government could argue that there was no amended return filed and I think that we would be in a very difficult position to start the running of the amended return, the government could then say the amended return is not filed.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.139" offset="694678">In this case and the cases that have taken place in the Second, Fifth, and Tenth Circuits that is not the facts that we have to deal with, in fact, in all of those cases, the amended return was taken and the tax that was due on the ammended return was collected by the Internal Revenue Service.</text>

            <label>Mr. Barry I. Fredericks</label>
            <text syncTime="165.072" offset="802407">--I think that the issue of the ammended return is one that the government presses which i have always thought has been a question of an ostrich type argument in so far as they can deny the existence of an ammended return except that the Internal Revenue Code at length refers to ammended returns and is a practice that has been going on for some time and has been recognized by the courts and in many cases has been used by the government in connection with their criminal prosecutions of the people who have been filing fraudulent tax returns in the first instance.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.129" offset="938557">The Dowell case and the Klemp case, I believe, in both instances the government used the ammended return as part of their case in chief to establish the question of fraud.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.420" offset="987772">I think the question the Chief Judge poses is an interesting one.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.907" offset="1005744">I really can't answer the question of what would happen if the government refused to accept that amended return, which they may or may not have a right to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.645" offset="1036673">But, in this case and in the cases that have the issue as has been presented that has not been the situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.881" offset="1061646">The amended return has been fully accepted by the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.250" offset="1075125">And, we suggest that upon the filing of that amended return that the Tax Court ruling in Bennett, which was decided in 1958, and acquiesced in by the United States government, which was a case of the fraudulent failure to file a tax return at all and a criminal prosecution of that taxpayer for fraudulently failing to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="257.318" offset="1171360">In a subsequent filing of a non-fraudulent return, the Tax Court and the government concluded that at that point the three-year statute of limitations provided in 6501(a) began to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.243" offset="1231024">I suggest that there is no basis to distinguish that case from the case at bar.</text>

            <text syncTime="370.107" offset="1622547">And, I would suggest, Your Honor, that one must go back to 1918 when the statute was first enacted and at that time Congress provided a five-year statute of limitations and an exemption in the case of filing a fraudulent tax return.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.434" offset="1687854">No mention was made at all on failure to file.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.468" offset="1699974">In 1921, Congress then enacted what is now the predecessor of the sections we are dealing with.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.224" offset="1731008">And, it said the fraudulent failure to file or... I am sorry, the filing of a fraudulent return or the failure to file in a single sentence.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.716" offset="1780954">And, I suggest that that indicated an intention by Congress to deal with these two situations identically.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.286" offset="1807181">In fact, all of the Circuit Courts that have considered this matter have all concluded that the two sections must be read in pari materia.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.744" offset="1845111">I don't think that is in question here.</text>
            <text syncTime="427.644" offset="1852634">It is only in 1954 when the '54 Code comes into being that the two section, which were in one sentence, were split into two sections.</text>
            <text syncTime="439.485" offset="1900072">And, there is no substantial legislative history one way or the other to indicate why.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.205" offset="1918880">I suggest that the legislative history, which indicates that both of these sections were to be identically when they were initially enacted, indicates there should be identical treatment.</text>

            <text syncTime="696.718" offset="2928983">Our position is that there is no statute running.</text>
            <text syncTime="700.253" offset="2943089">We are saying, as in Bennett, where the filing of what the government characterizes as a delinquent return now starts the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="708.775" offset="2977153">So, in my case, the filing of the amended return starts the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="713.077" offset="2994394">In the 25 percent case, that statute begins to run the day the return is filed, whether the government discovers it or doesn't discover it, no matter what happens, and neither the taxpayer nor the government can stay off the running of that statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="729.189" offset="3058864">In our case, the government's position is that they have forever, literally forever, because if you buy the government's position, the taxpayer can have died, his estate could have been passed on to three generations and still the statute of limitations on transferees don't begin to run until one year after the initial statute would begin to run.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.868" offset="3149561">The government can go on down three generations to assess this tax if they so choose.</text>
            <text syncTime="759.058" offset="3178296">The other problem that we suggest exists is that by not having a statute of limitations of any kind the government is in a situation where they can come in after the amended tax return has been filed and make numerous denials of deductions claimed by the taxpayer and then that burden shifts to the taxpayer, which is exactly what happened in this situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="786.541" offset="3288219">The taxpayer has the burden of proof of establishing the propriety of certain deductions that he has made.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.929" offset="3313819">Having now been ten years down the road we run into the very reason that this Court says that statute of limitations exist so that no issue shall be tried at a time when evidence disappears, memories fade, and witnesses are not available.</text>
            <text syncTime="812.426" offset="3391769">To give the government an open-ended position after the amended return comes in, we suggest opens up a substantial area of government abuse and we suggest that when the government says--</text>

            <text syncTime="1012.074" offset="4190384">There is no government policy that warrants such an open-ended civil statute of limitations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1018.728" offset="4217029">The government disagrees.</text>
            <text syncTime="1020.661" offset="4224761">It says, well, it needs this in order to allow them to proceed with their criminal investigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="1032.535" offset="4272200">Certainly the criminal investigation, at the time that the government has referred the matter to the Department of Justice for criminal investigation, they will have gathered enough information to meet the civil burden which is far less than their criminal burden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.215" offset="4346910">Secondly, the amended return gives the government one advantage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.353" offset="4371465">It has an admission against interest by the would-be defendant to which they can compare with the original return and clearly determine right from the face of the amended return where the fraud was and in what directions they have to go.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.112" offset="4430502">At the time that the government seeks an indictment, it certainly has a more than prima facie case.</text>

            <text offset="4824010">This case presents a straight forward question of statutory construction.</text>
            <text offset="4823906">Section 6501(a) provides in general that the Commissioner must assess the tax within three years of the date a return is filed.</text>
            <text offset="4823801">Section 6501(c)(1) has an exception to this rule.</text>
            <text offset="4823697">It says that in the case of a false or fraudulent return filed with the intent to evade tax, the tax may be assessed at any time.</text>
            <text offset="4823592">The Code has allowed the Commissioner to assess the tax at any time in broad cases since 1918.</text>
            <text offset="4823488">We think the words of the statute are clear and unambiguous.</text>
            <text offset="4823383">Section 6501(c)(1), the at-any-time provision, plainly came into operation when the taxpayers filed their original returns here because those returns were, or are deemed for present purposes, to have been false and fraudulent.</text>
            <text offset="4823279">And, there is nothing in that section which could serve to call off its operation by reference to a fraudulent filer's later conduct, be it the filing of an amended return or doing anything else.</text>
            <text offset="4823174">Likewise, Subsection (a), with the three-year rule, plainly did not come into play when taxpayers filed their original returns here because that section, by its terms, cannot apply when the return is false and fraudulent.</text>

            <text offset="4823697">I think this language is also supported by the fact that amended returns are not even recognized by the Code.</text>
            <text offset="4823592">The Code does not permit, officially permit the taxpayer to file amended returns nor does it require the Commissioner to accept them if they are filed.</text>
            <text offset="4823488">Indeed, this Court last term in Hillsboro Bank noted that amended returns are entirely creatures of IRS art and the Commissioner has discretion to reject them.</text>
            <text offset="4823383">Now, because amended returns are not part of the structure that Congress enacted in the Code, and because the Commissioner can reject them in his discretion, we think Congress is very unlikely to have intended that these documents would have any kind of controlling effect on the operation of the limitations rules.</text>

            <text syncTime="1170.507" offset="4824115">This Court held in a companion case to Zellerbach Paper that an amended return, if both the amended and original are honest, it does not give the Commissioner more time.</text>
            <text offset="4824010">It is three years from the original return's filing date.</text>
            <text offset="4823906">Now, because we think that language of the Code is clear and unambiguous and because we think that the plain reading of the statute is confirmed by the operation of other Code provisions, there is no need here to go on to look at tax policy as a basis for decision.</text>

            <label>Mr. Albert G. Lauber, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="1170.507" offset="4824115">Well, Bennett is where there is fraudulent failure to file any return at all.</text>
            <text offset="4824010">I guess I would have to say it is not easier to detect fraud there.</text>
            <text offset="4823906">But, what happens in practice is the Commissioner brings very, very few actions, prosecutions on the criminal front for fraudulent non-filing.</text>
            <text offset="4823801">The reason for that is that it is very hard to get a jury to buy the fact that a guy committed fraud if he did nothing at all.</text>
            <text offset="4823697">So, in fact, there are only a handful of those prosecutions.</text>
            <text offset="4823592">What the government does is alternatively bring a prosecution for willful failure to file where fraud need not be proven and this is only a misdemeanor rather than a felony.</text>
            <text offset="4823488">So, in practice, the way we deal with that problem is to go the other route.</text>

            <text offset="4824010">Willfull, I guess, is intentional violation of a known legal duty and fraud connotes something about bad acts beyond that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1170.507" offset="4824115">Yes.</text>
            <text offset="4824010">But, in effect, the Commissioner generally does not indict for fraudulent failure to file.</text>
            <text offset="4823906">Now, of course, the Petitioners, of course, base their entire case on tax policy.</text>
            <text offset="4823801">Their view is that once the Commissioner has an amended return that ultimately turns out to be non-fraudulent, he doesn't need the additional time provided by Section (c)(1).</text>
            <text offset="4823697">At that point, Petitioners contend that the Commissioner's fraud investigation should be limited by the three-year rule that applies in non-fraud cases.</text>
            <text offset="4823592">We think this argument is wrong and that the Court of Appeals was correct in determining that, in fact, strong reasons of tax policy support a plain reading of the statute.</text>
            <text offset="4823488">First of all, the filing of an amended return, however honest it ultimately proves to be, does not really change the nature of a tax fraud investigation.</text>
            <text offset="4823383">Congress chose to permit assessment at any time in fraud cases for very good reasons.</text>
            <text offset="4823279">Fraud is hard to investigate, both because the controlling issue is one of intent and because fraud is often accompanied by its badges such the falsification or destruction of records.</text>
            <text offset="4823174">Beyond that the Commissioner has the burden of proof on the fraud issue.</text>
            <text offset="4823070">But, the reasons that lead Congress to enact the at-any-time rule in fraud cases persists even though the taxpayer files an amended return.</text>
            <text offset="4822965">The case is still a fraud case with all the attendant problems of examination and the Commissioner still has the burden of proof.</text>
            <text offset="4822861">An amended return comes with no imprimatur upon it.</text>
            <text offset="4822756">Indeed, it comes from a taxpayer who has already made false statements under penalties of perjury.</text>
            <text offset="4822652">In our view the data on the amended return are no different from any other data that come into the Commissioner's hand during a tax fraud investigation.</text>
            <text offset="4822547">It must be examined just as carefully.</text>
            <text offset="4822443">That point might be illustrated by the facts of the cases before us today.</text>
            <text offset="4822338">In these cases, the fraud consisted of diverting business receivables into the secret bank accounts maintained on behalf of the company's employees.</text>
            <text offset="4822234">Now, the Commissioner could have been alerted to that fraud, both the facts of the fraud and the amount of the diverted receipts in any number of ways.</text>
            <text offset="4822129">It could have been a tip from an unhappy employee, as indeed almost happened in Deleet, it could have been a tip from a competitor or supplier or customer of the business, or it could have come from a bank or accounting firm.</text>
            <text offset="4822025">We think it is clear that it could not possibly be contended that had the Commissioner got this useful, correct information from a third party, the three-year rule would then all of a sudden applied in the fraud case.</text>
            <text offset="4821920">We think there is no reason on grounds of tax policy for a different result merely because that data happens to be contained in the vehicle of an amended return.</text>
            <text offset="4821816">In short, our view is that the Commissioner's need for an unlimited period of assessment in fraud cases is not materially diminished by the filing of an amended return.</text>
            <text offset="4821712">And, we think there is no reason to hold that amended returns of all the manifold documents and data that might bear on tax fraud has the unique effect, the singular effect, of shortening to three years the unlimited period that governs fraud cases generally.</text>
            <text offset="4821607">We think there is a second and discreet reason for holding on grounds of tax policy, that the three-year rule should not come into play in tax fraud cases.</text>
            <text offset="4821503">This has to do with the Commissioner's duty to pursue criminal tax enforcement.</text>
            <text offset="4821398">As this Court has noted in the past, Congress has charged the Commissioner with pursuing both criminal and civil aspects in tax fraud.</text>
            <text offset="4821294">Limitations period for prosecuting criminal tax fraud is not three but six years.</text>
            <text offset="4821189">As a result, it will often be impossible on a practical ground and unwise as a matter of efficient and sound tax administration for the Commissioner to close down his civil audit within three years of getting an amended return on the taxpayer.</text>
            <text offset="4821085">The practical problems here we think are fairly evident.</text>
            <text offset="4820980">Once the Commissioner makes a referral to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, he loses his primary audit tool; that is his power to summons the books, records, and testimony of the taxpayers and third parties.</text>
            <text offset="4820876">This result is required by LaSalle Bank, from this Court, and by Congress' later amendment of Code Section 7602.</text>
            <text offset="4820771">But, that means, having lost the summons power, the Commissioner must in effect close down or suspend the civil audit because he has no way of getting information from the taxpayer.</text>
            <text offset="4820667">But, apart from these practical problems, the Commissioner has long had a policy of suspending civil audit pending the completion of criminal proceedings.</text>
            <text offset="4820562">This policy is set forth in the Internal Revenue Manual and it stems from the difficulty of conducting at the same time a civil tax fraud litigation while a criminal tax fraud investigation is continuing.</text>
            <text offset="4820458">And, the most obvious problem, of course, is the risk of killing the criminal case by making a premature disclosure of evidence to the potential defendant.</text>
            <text offset="4820353">If the three-year rule is held to apply here, the Commissioner, right in the middle of his criminal tax fraud investigation, is going to have to send a notice of deficiency to the taxpayer asserting civil tax fraud.</text>
            <text offset="4820249">The taxpayer will then go into Tax Court or the District Court and the Commissioner will be required by the rules of those Courts to allege fraud affirmatively in the answer and then be subject to discovery, interrogatories and depositions, about his fraud theory.</text>
            <text offset="4820144">I think it is pretty clear that if the Commissioner is required to open up his files right in the middle of the on-going criminal investigation, laying out his theory of fraud and the fact he expects to rely on in proving fraud, that criminal case could probably be killed.</text>
            <text offset="4820040">Beyond that, we think there are other problems in maintaining an on-going criminal investigation and a parallel civil tax fraud litigation.</text>
            <text offset="4819935">In the civil case, the taxpayer, for example, will probably assert the Fifth Amendment privilege barring any introduction of evidence on the issue of fraud.</text>
            <text offset="4819831">There could be problems with witnesses because of the premature disclosure of their names through potential defendant and finally there can be problems where the taxpayer puts up a defense as a beleaguered defendant in a criminal action asserting the Commissioner is trying to dun him on five different fronts at once, grab his money, and juries occasionally have been persuaded by that kind of evidence.</text>
            <text offset="4819726">So, for all these reasons, we think that the Commissioner's policy of suspending civil tax audit until the completion of criminal proceedings is salutary both on grounds of fairness to the taxpayer and on grounds of sensible administration of the tax laws.</text>
            <text offset="4819622">Petitioners' argument here would effectively kill that policy.</text>
            <text offset="4819517">And, finally, we think there is one last reason for tax policy that counsels in favor of a plain reading of the Code here.</text>
            <text offset="4819413">And this has to do with the Commissioner's overall duties to enforce the tax laws.</text>
            <text offset="4819308">Tax laws are complicated.</text>
            <text offset="4819204">Taxpayers are well advised and sometimes devious and the Commissioner has limited resources.</text>
            <text offset="4819099">Every year about two million amended returns are filed.</text>
            <text offset="4818995">We think it would be a very bad idea to let amended returns to become yet another tool in the hands of people trying to evade the tax laws which they could use to manipulate the limitations period to their own advantage, depending on how, what, and when they file.</text>
            <text offset="4818890">If there are no further questions, we think the decision below should be affirmed.</text>

            <text syncTime="1170.507" offset="4824115">I would like to just respond to one question that Justice White asked about the imposition of the fraud penalty and I read from the government's Revenue ruling that I referred to earlier.</text>
            <text offset="4824010">I think the government's position is very simple.</text>
            <text offset="4823906">The imposition of a civil fraud penalty under Section 6635(b) of the Code does not necessarily indicate that the tax can be assessed at any time under Section 6501(c) even though the taxpayer was subject to the penalty for underpayment due to fraud.</text>
            <text offset="4823801">It goes on to hold that that must be done within three years of... That was the Bennett case they were referring to, but within three years of the filing of the delinquent return.</text>
            <text offset="4823697">Judge Stevens, your question concerning the original return which was subsequently modified by the amended return, that case, I believe, was decided in the Tenth Circuit, Alkire versus Nicholas, and in that case the Court held that it was the amended return since the original return was insufficient; that the amended return was the return that started the running of the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text offset="4823592">We have cited that case in both the Badaracco brief and ours.</text>
            <text offset="4823488">But, it was not as the government had indicated on that.</text>

            <text syncTime="1170.507" offset="4824115">On the question of minimal tax fraud questions, there is no such thing as a minimal return.</text>
            <text offset="4824010">If a return is fraudulent in any degree, it is deemed by the government to be totally fraudulent irrespective of the amount, irrespective of the issue, and, therefore, would be subject to this open-ended statute of limitations urged by the government.</text>
            <text offset="4823906">I suggest that the government's tax policies are not well taken and we have covered each of them in our briefs.</text>
            <text offset="4823801">But, the point at hand is the government has several ways of avoiding this problem.</text>
            <text offset="4823697">One, as the Chief Justice raised when they initially stepped to the podium, and that is don't accept the amended return.</text>
            <text offset="4823592">Two, the government can say, taxpayer, your time is about to run out, extend the statute of limitations.</text>
            <text offset="4823488">They do it all the time on a regular basis.</text>
            <text offset="4823383">Three, simply take your figures and assess the tax.</text>
            <text offset="4823279">This is not an attempt in any way to inhibit the government's criminal investigation.</text>
            <text offset="4823174">It is not in any way inhibited to avoid penalties.</text>
            <text offset="4823070">It is designed to say that a taxpayer who has seen the error of his ways and has filed an amended return shouldn't be open to a statute of limitations that runs forever and the government shouldn't be allowed to sit back and wait 10, 15, 20, 30 years and then come in and deny certain deductions that the taxpayer has made which places the burden on the taxpayer to prove the validity of those deductions.</text>
            <text offset="4822965">We suggest that the position in Bennett acquiesced in by the government is identical here; that the policy considerations are, in fact, in favor of the taxpayer; that nothing we are requesting strains or prevents the government from enforcing the tax laws, and for those reasons we respectfully suggest that the decision of the Third Circuit be reversed and the decision of the lower courts be reinstated.</text>
            <text offset="4822861">Thank you all.</text>
