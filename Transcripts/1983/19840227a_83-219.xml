            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="132852">We will hear arguments next in McDonald against the City of West Branch.</text>
            <text syncTime="3.202" offset="145600">Mr. Achtenberg, you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. David J. Achtenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="9.022" offset="168901">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="13.891" offset="188336">Gary McDonald brought this Section 1983 action to establish that his discharge violated his rights under the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="22.846" offset="224176">The issue before this Court is whether he should have been forbidden to do that because of a prior arbitration decision... a decision which did not deal with the constitutional issue, a decision by an arbitrator who was not presented with and did not decide the constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.856" offset="292199">In Alexander v. Gardner-Denver and in Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight this Court held that prior arbitration awards did not bar subsequent actions under the Fair Labor Standards Act and under Title VII.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.032" offset="348937">And the issue before this Court today is whether there is some reason why a different rule should apply to Section 1983 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="62.305" offset="382060">McDonald was discharged after receiving and becoming involved in the presentation of certain citizen complaints against the chief of police.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.243" offset="425737">These were complaints by members of the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.862" offset="432215">As a police officer he had received from at least six different women complaints that the chief was involved in some form of sexual misconduct or sexual assault.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.718" offset="475683">He passed these on to various city officials, and an investigation of the chief ensued.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.388" offset="498357">The chief was unhappy about this and threatened McDonald and threatened one of the other officers.</text>
            <text syncTime="97.359" offset="522285">He told McDonald on at least two occasions that he would have his job for starting the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.715" offset="547676">This harassment culminated when McDonald set up a meeting where one of the complaining women was to present certain information to the mayor in her own words.</text>
            <text syncTime="114.254" offset="589786">The chief walked into that meeting and threatened the woman, he threatened McDonald.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.241" offset="617789">He again said that he would have McDonald's job for starting the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.276" offset="629910">The very next day the chief announced to the city council that McDonald would be fired, and the actual firing took place the day after that.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.382" offset="666377">McDonald proceeded to file a grievance under the grievance procedure provided in the collective bargaining agreement, but the grievance procedure and arbitration procedure which followed exemplified many of the problems which are involved in using arbitration in this sort of case.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.510" offset="734818">McDonald was provided essentially no notice of the only charge which the arbitrator sustained against him... the charge of having committed a sexual assault on a minor female.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.949" offset="776614">Until the alleged victim, Mrs. Dack, took the stand at arbitration, McDonald was never told who it was he was supposed to have assaulted, or when or where he was supposed to have assaulted her.</text>

            <text syncTime="179.779" offset="851951">Well, does that bring up the subject of waiver possibly?</text>
            <text syncTime="186.933" offset="880581">Because you're complaining about something now that he didn't object to then.</text>

            <label>Mr. David J. Achtenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="195.372" offset="914331">I don't believe it can be said that he had not made the request on numerous occasions.</text>
            <text syncTime="200.443" offset="934602">The question of whether he would have been entitled to a waiver under the contract is one that we have absolutely nothing in the record on.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.597" offset="963232">Just as... and I think that that brings us to one of the other problems with using arbitration to resolve individual rights questions; and that is that McDonald did not control his own defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.808" offset="1028016">It was not his decision whether to ask for an adjournment or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="228.843" offset="1048183">It was the decision--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. David J. Achtenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="230.912" offset="1056437">--It was the decision of the attorney assigned to him by the union over his objection.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.283" offset="1073887">He... he requested... he asked the union whether he could have his own attorney present and was told he could not.</text>
            <text syncTime="242.853" offset="1104189">He did not even make the decision to go to arbitration.</text>
            <text syncTime="246.489" offset="1118713">That decision was made by the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="247.757" offset="1123833">The union, together with the city, without the involvement of McDonald, picked the arbitrator.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.245" offset="1149747">And the union's attorney elected not to call the crucial witness who would have corroborated McDonald's testimony; that is that the so-called Dack incident simply never occurred; that McDonald never touched Barbara Dack, that he never said anything offensive to her.</text>
            <text syncTime="269.920" offset="1212441">That witness was called at trial and was undoubtedly persuasive corroboration of McDonald's testimony to the same effect.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="277.360" offset="1242220">Well, Mr. Achetenberg, is that any different than if this had, say, been a trial in a trial court of general jurisdiction, and the petitioner's lawyer there hadn't called a witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="289.751" offset="1291853">I mean that's kind of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, isn't it?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="david_j_achtenberg" startTime="293.036" stopTime="312.580">

            <text syncTime="295.202" offset="1313587">The... the lack of control over your own defense in a situation in which the counsel represents you, not the interests of the union, is somewhat different than the situation where the attorney is there to represent the union's interest.</text>

            <text syncTime="312.580" offset="1383072">Are you suggesting that the union had kind of a secret interest in not calling this particular witness, or just that the union lawyer wasn't particularly diligent?</text>

            <text syncTime="325.071" offset="1433123">He may have had concerns about what effects that might have on the witness, on the witness himself, who was also a union member.</text>

            <text syncTime="344.984" offset="1512744">The original complaint in this case had the union joined in a state law pendant claim as a defendant for failure of adequate representation.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.442" offset="1558615">The district court dismissed that, not on the merits but on the basis that it did not want to take pendant jurisdiction over that state law issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.648" offset="1591425">Now, that has not been further pursued; at least to my knowledge that has not been pursued.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="370.369" offset="1614308">If you did not prevail here, would you have an action over in the state courts against the union or the union lawyer?</text>

            <label>Mr. David J. Achtenberg</label>
            <text syncTime="380.491" offset="1654746">I believe it would be time barred.</text>
            <text syncTime="382.843" offset="1664150">The issue presented to the arbitrator was not even the same issue which is presented by the Section 1983 complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.369" offset="1722246">Under Mount Healthy v. Doyle, the issue in the 1983 complaint is one of motive, one of what was in Chief Longstreet's mind.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.459" offset="1754638">Would he have decided to discharge McDonald even without the First Amendment activity?</text>
            <text syncTime="411.696" offset="1779611">The question the arbitrator decided was a different issue, and that was simply whether there was a justification assuming pure motive.</text>
            <text syncTime="419.767" offset="1811899">It's very similar to what happened in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver where the arbitrator... in Alexander the employee was charged with having produced too many defective parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="432.942" offset="1864561">He was in a parts plant.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.894" offset="1872398">The arbitrator dealt with the issue of whether or not he produced too many defective parts and whether that was grounds under the contract for the discharge, but not with the issue of whether that was the real reason for the discharge, whether in fact racial discrimination was being masked by this justification.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.023" offset="1948885">Similarly here the arbitrator did not deal with the issue of whether anti-First Amendment animus, you might call it, was being masked here by the excuse of the... of the Dack incident, which... or the alleged Dack incident.</text>
            <text syncTime="471.567" offset="2019102">I think I should deal with the argument made primarily by amicus EEAC that we need to avoid... we need to grant preclusion in this case because otherwise we will fill the courts with Section 1983 cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="489.779" offset="2091931">I don't think that will happen, but before we turn to that, I think it's important to remember that we... Congress has expressed a fundamental commitment to the vindication of this sort of right.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.538" offset="2146997">In 1871 when federal causes of action were few and far between, Congress thought these rights were important enough to create such a cause of action.</text>
            <text syncTime="513.910" offset="2188480">And again in 1976 when it passed the Civil Rights Attorney's Fee Act, Congress expressed its belief that these cases were sufficiently important that special incentives in the way of attorneys' fees for prevailing plaintiffs should be provided to bring them.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.355" offset="2254204">And I don't think that this sort of fundamental congressional commitment should be lightly ignored; but I don't think that considerations of judicial economy necessarily militate in favor of granting preclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="543.746" offset="2307807">As this Court pointed out in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver, and I believe in Barrentine, granting a rule of preclusion will give incentives to unions and employees to skip the arbitration process and instead go directly into court, either state or federal.</text>

            <text syncTime="593.577" offset="2507069">It is possible that they might not agree to arbitration, but I think more likely that they would exclude specifically this sort of claim rather than doing so implicitly, as I think they have in most cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.153" offset="2561404">They might explicitly exclude this sort of claim so that although the contractual issue might be resolved in arbitration, the 1983 constitutional claim would be separated out and clearly could not be precluded from being brought in federal court.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.698" offset="2627546">And therefore, cases which would otherwise be resolved in arbitration, either because the employee won and got the relief he was looking for, or because he lost and for the first time realized that there were witnesses who were going to testify against him, that what seemed to him to be an obviously just cause might not seem so obvious to an impartial decisionmaker.</text>
