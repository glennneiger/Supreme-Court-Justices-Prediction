            <label>Mr. Eric R. Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="105.373" offset="573558">The primary issue in this case is whether or not a state public employee bargaining law violates either the First or the Fourteenth Amendments where it requires a public employer to meet and confer only with an exclusive representative and that exclusive representative uses only its members as apart of the meet and confer meeting.</text>
            <text syncTime="132.151" offset="680660">In the alternative, should this Court affirm the lower court, the second issue is if every public employee is entitled to run and vote in elections for membership on the meet and confer committees, do the First and Fourteenth Amendments require that a system of cumulative voting be utilized in those elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="158.716" offset="786927">The fundamental facts in the case are neither extensive nor in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.031" offset="808242">The Plaintiffs are individual faculty members employed on several of the campuses of the 18-campus system in the Minnesota Community College system.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.419" offset="853800">These individual faculty member Plaintiffs are opposed to having the defendant labor organizations represent them concerning their employment interests.</text>
            <text syncTime="187.056" offset="900298">The defendant labor organizations consist of the Minnesota Community College Faculty Association, the MCCFA, which is a voluntary association of faculty members within the Community College system.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.826" offset="963410">It is the legally certified exclusive representative for all of the faculty members within the Community College system.</text>
            <text syncTime="210.200" offset="992876">Its primary purpose is to represent the employment interest of all of the faculty members.</text>
            <text syncTime="216.355" offset="1017535">The Minnesota Education Association is a state-wide voluntary association of educators which is the state affiliate for the MCCFA.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.301" offset="1053271">The National Education Association is a voluntary association of educators which is the national affiliate of the MCCFA and the MEA.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.366" offset="1093604">The Community College Board is a state agency of Minnesota charged with the management of the Community College system.</text>
            <text syncTime="244.432" offset="1129862">It is the employer of the faculty members involved in this action.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.377" offset="1149611">Our Public Employment Labor Relations Act in Minnesota was passed in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.901" offset="1179704">It is a comprehensive system for labor relations for public employers and public employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.635" offset="1202691">Its stated policies of PELRA are to promote orderly and constructive relationships between public employers and public employees; that unresolved disputes between employers and employees are injurious to both the parties as well as the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.515" offset="1274162">The policy section further specifically indicates that one of the policies is to grant the employees the right to organize and choose freely their representatives.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.524" offset="1322228">PELRA specifically provides for a democratic selection of those representatives in the form that an election may take place every two years to determine who the exclusive representative for the faculty members in this particular bargaining unit shall be.</text>
            <text syncTime="310.707" offset="1394953">The fundamental framework of PELRA to achieve these policies is the use of the concept of exclusive representation of employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.833" offset="1439465">All exclusive representatives under PELRA are obligated to meet and negotiate, that is collectively bargain the terms and conditions of employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.710" offset="1482933">Those terms and conditions of employment are defined expressly in PELRA as being the hours of employment, compensation, and the personnel policies affecting the working conditions of the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.209" offset="1532984">PELRA specifically indicates that there are subjects which are not to be subjected to the collective bargaining process.</text>
            <text syncTime="356.097" offset="1576451">That, in our state statute, is referred to as inherent managerial policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.119" offset="1596618">Those are areas of discretion in policy such as the overall budget, the organizational structure of the employer, and the selection and direction of personnel.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.396" offset="1641653">Thus, there are two major arenas of activity for an exclusive representative; that is negotiable areas and non-negotiable areas, and specifically as to professional employees in Minnesota the exclusive representative is charged to meet and confer with the public employer concerning areas within the inherent management discretion area.</text>
            <text syncTime="401.855" offset="1759518">This is a right that is not extended to other public employees other than professional public employees in Minnesota.</text>

            <text syncTime="2634.528" offset="10690260">This statute, if we can look at it in a practical sense, really in the academic context codified that system.</text>

            <text syncTime="2702.332" offset="10961411">It is one thing to have a faculty senate get together and pass a bunch of resolutions, but I remember the remark of a colleague of mine in a former employment who had been a member of a law faculty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2714.380" offset="11009581">He said that the only thing worse than the meetings of the law faculty were the meetings of a full faculty, that the meetings of a full faculty simply never ended.</text>
            <text syncTime="2724.865" offset="11051586">If you are talking about a meeting of people to get together and pass a resolution when everyone there is voluntarily present it is one thing, but to require the administrators to sit and attend something, I think the state has a right to say you channel it, you don't have to listen to every single individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2744.460" offset="11129953">Now, that is not interfering with the right of petition, but it is just the idea of the administrator being on the scene and kind of reacting.</text>

            <text syncTime="2761.590" offset="11198499">We are not attacking the structure of meet and confer in the sense that it sets up a regularized procedure whereby individuals are chosen to serve on these committees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2773.628" offset="11246564">If the state wants to have such a regularized procedure, that is excellent, but at least have all of the professional employees in the relevant unit allowed to participate in the selection of those representatives and allowed to stand for election.</text>

            <text syncTime="2812.374" offset="11401627">The only difference will be the composition within those committees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2815.915" offset="11415733">From the Board's point of view, it makes absolutely no difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="2820.209" offset="11432974">They are running the system precisely the way it has always been run.</text>

            <text syncTime="2827.545" offset="11462231">From MCCFA's position, it makes a great deal of difference because now people will have a different perspective on academic questions, now people whom the Chief Justice perhaps correctly called dissidents in the sense that they dissent from MCCFA's policies, now those individuals will have some small voice in the official mechanism of communication to their employers.</text>
