            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="132857">We'll hear arguments next in Daily Income Fund against Fox.</text>
            <text syncTime="8.267" offset="165876">Mr. Pollack, I think you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="daniel_a_pollack" startTime="68.939" stopTime="307.646">
            <label>Mr. Daniel A. Pollack</label>
            <text syncTime="68.939" offset="408606">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="78.123" offset="445281">The question presented in this case is whether a shareholder's action under Section 36(b) of the Investment Company Act is exempt from the director demand requirement of Rule 23.1 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="100.618" offset="535247">Underlying this seemingly narrow question are several questions of perhaps more profound dimension, some or all of which this Court may wish to consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="115.037" offset="592926">First, what exactly is a derivative action or, stated another way, what are the necessary and sufficient conditions for a derivative action?</text>
            <text syncTime="126.605" offset="639215">Second, what is the purpose of the director demand requirement?</text>
            <text syncTime="132.969" offset="664710">Third, does an investment company have an implied right of action under Section 36(b)?</text>
            <text syncTime="141.765" offset="699819">Petitioners' position in this case is that the director demand requirement does apply to a shareholder's action under Section 36(b) because the action is derivative; that the director demand requirement performs a most valuable function of permitting pre-litigation resolution or adjustment of disputes, thus avoiding needless litigation; and that the director demand requirement is consistent with two long-standing and salutary policies repeatedly upheld by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.162" offset="865435">First, the exhaustion of intracorporate remedies, and, second, letting directors direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="191.399" offset="898349">The facts in this case may be simply summarized, and they are in our blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.734" offset="923740">The Daily Income Fund is a money market fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="201.687" offset="939518">Reich &amp; Tang are the investment advisors to Daily Income Fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.040" offset="960939">A majority of the directors of Daily Income Fund are disinterested directors; that is they are in no way affiliated with or associated with the advisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.278" offset="1009944">In 1981, Martin Fox, a minority shareholder of the Daily Income Fund, instituted an action against Reich &amp; Tang allegedly to recover excessive fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="233.177" offset="1065533">In doing so, he simply ignored the directors and by-passed entirely the board.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.723" offset="1095730">Judge Kevin T. Duffy in the Southern District of New York dismissed his complaint for failure to comply with the director demand requirement of Rule 23.1.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.449" offset="1146617">The Court of Appeals reversed and held that no compliance was required, because the action was not, in the words of the Court of Appeals, "strictly speaking derivative".</text>
            <text syncTime="269.060" offset="1208997">The Court of Appeals reached this conclusion because it said that the investment company itself had no right of action under Section 36(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="280.568" offset="1255077">The Court of Appeals also went on to hold in a supplementary holding that demand on the directors would be, in its words,</text>
            <text syncTime="289.975" offset="1292694">"an empty, unfruitful, and dilatory exercise. "</text>
            <text syncTime="295.447" offset="1314637">The starting point of the legal analysis seems not to be in dispute.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.471" offset="1338669">Rule 23.1 applies to and governs all derivative actions in the federal courts.</text>

            <text syncTime="439.872" offset="1892256">If the starting point is that Rule 23.1 does apply to and govern all derivative actions in the federal courts, the initial question becomes is a shareholder's action under Section 36(b) derivative?</text>
            <text syncTime="455.283" offset="1953905">This Court has said that it is derivative and Congress has said that it is derivative.</text>
            <text syncTime="461.096" offset="1977206">In the landmark case of Burks against Lasker decided by this Court four years ago, Mr. Justice Brennan, writing for the unanimous Court, stated as a general proposition a derivative suit is brought by shareholders to enforce a claim on behalf of a corporation.</text>

            <text syncTime="491.758" offset="2099877">More specifically and more importantly for present purposes, Mr. Justice Brennan went on specifically to refer to a suit under this very section, Section 36(b), as a derivative suit at page 484 of 441 U.S. Mr. Justice Brennan stated for the unanimous Court, and when Congress did intend to prevent board action from cutting off derivative suits it said so expressly.</text>
            <text syncTime="524.018" offset="2228922">Section 36(b) added to the Act in 1970, performs precisely this function for derivative suits charging breach of fiduciary duty with respect to advisor fees.</text>
            <text syncTime="538.987" offset="2288795">That seems to me to be an unequivocal and unambiguous recognition by this Court of the derivative nature of the shareholder's action under Section 36(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="550.655" offset="2335397">Congress, as I said a moment ago, has also characterized such actions as derivative.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.240" offset="2361729">In the 1970 House Report, which is cited in our briefs, it is stated at page 78,</text>

            <text syncTime="726.840" offset="3040181">The Court of Appeals, ignoring the evidence of the derivative nature of a Section 36(b) action which I have just cited to the Court, that is Justice Brennan's statement in Burks and the House Report references to an action as derivative, determined that this was not a derivative action because the company itself has no right of action under Section 36(b).</text>

            <text syncTime="785.707" offset="3275597">But, when Congress says this is the kind of action that can be brought and it may be brought by an (a), a (b), or a (c), isn't that pretty well the ball game?</text>

            <label>Mr. Daniel A. Pollack</label>
            <text syncTime="797.435" offset="3322513">We believe that the recent cases of this Court, and I think it is Cannon... I may have juggled them in my mind... While I am standing here, I will look before I rebut... stands for the proposition that the fundamental purpose of the section must be considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.539" offset="3398999">And, in this case, the fundamental purpose of Section 36(b), which was enacted in 1970, was to strengthen the hand and role of the independent directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="828.186" offset="3445601">Looking first at the language to determine whether there is an implied right, the section itself says, in pertinent part, that a shareholder may sue "on behalf of" the investment company.</text>
            <text syncTime="845.538" offset="3514983">We believe that that is clearly suggestive of a derivative concept.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.789" offset="3531910">Turning to the legislative history, unfortunately, as in many statutes, the legislative history appears to be silent on the issue of an implied right as regards the investment company itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="864.520" offset="3590842">Therefore, one must look in the terms of the Merrill Lynch and Curran analysis to the state of the law at the time Congress passed this section in 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="877.748" offset="3643819">And, the state-of-the-law was that there was universal recognition of the derivative character of a lawsuit to recovery excessive fees from an investment advisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="890.187" offset="3693556">We have cited those cases at commonlaw and also under Section 36 which preceded 36(b) at page 10 of our blue brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.984" offset="3736710">It follows necessarily that if those suits were derivative prior to the enactment of this section, that they were derived from a primary right in the investment company itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="914.453" offset="3790627">Congress is, of course, under the current doctrine, presumed to know the state-of-the-law at the time it enacted Section 36(b) and since there is no evidence whatsoever of congressional intent to deny or eliminate that right in the investment company, we believe that the presumption should be applied that Congress must have intended to preserve that right.</text>
            <text syncTime="942.110" offset="3901281">To do so is consistent with the overall intent of the 1970 amendments as I mentioned a moment ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="949.495" offset="3930748">That overall intent was in part to strengthen the role of the disinterested directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="957.690" offset="3963557">And, it makes good sense to imply a right in this situation because the fact that a shareholder was granted a remedy to sue for excessive fees should not mean that the same remedy is not available to the investment company itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="976.073" offset="4037118">As we argue in the first page of our reply brief, the yellow-covered brief, there is something most anamolous about saying that an investment company, if a new group of directors comes aboard, has no right to sue its investment advisor if the directors feel that there has been an overcharging merely because a shareholder does not happen to raise the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="1001.150" offset="4137428">I find that a result that is almost unthinkable in terms of interpreteing a sensible intent on the part of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1011.516" offset="4178911">The Courts of Appeals went on in a supplementary holding to hold that the application of the director demand rule is inconsistent with the operation of Section 36(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="1027.288" offset="4241918">We believe this too is erroneous.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.981" offset="4256756">The fact that the directors may perhaps not be able to terminate a Section 36(b) action, a doctrine that is much talked about in the industry as a result of Mr. Justice Brennan's dictum in Burks does not--</text>

            <text syncTime="1061.402" offset="4378382">That is a fair criticism.</text>
            <text syncTime="1064.433" offset="4390503">We can well live with this, be it holding or dictum, because the fact is that the termination doctrine does not obviate the benefit of the demand rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.530" offset="4434911">The termination... The mere fact that directors may or may not be able to terminate a Section 36(b) action does not render nugatory the value of having a demand rule here and that value is to prevent, before there is litigation, unnecessary litigation, to let the directors rethink the question as to whether there has been an overcharge, to let the directors convince the shareholder that perhaps he is wrong.</text>

            <text syncTime="1499.551" offset="6130989">I think, in looking at the legislative history, that Mr. Pollack stated that the principal purpose of Section 36(b) was to strengthen the role of the independent directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1524.015" offset="6228896">I believe that is not at all the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1528.479" offset="6246764">The legislative history contains repeated references to the inadequacy of the independent directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1537.533" offset="6282917">It contains repeated references to the desire of Congress to entrust the enforcement of rights against investment advisors to security holders, not just shareholders, but all security holders, and to the Securities and Exchange Commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="1559.808" offset="6372047">The legislative history is replete with references to the fact that advisory fees by investment advisors to mutual funds and other investment companies had been excessive.</text>
            <text syncTime="1578.331" offset="6446130">The legislative history repeatedly asserts that not only have the directives been ineffective in reducing these fees, but also the so-called disclosure requirements under the Act have been ineffective and the asserted competition which the investment company institute maintained was effective was indeed no effective in reducing advisory fees under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1614.454" offset="6590640">Now, what did Congress provide with respect to this rather important function that my adversary assigns to the strengthening of directives?</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.585" offset="6655110">It did essentially three things.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.996" offset="6672769">It broadened the definition of affiliated directors, changed the terminology to call them interested directors, and expanded the definition of who would be an interested director to include, for example, a member of the immediate family of someone on the investment advisor, to include someone who had a substantial financial relationship with the investment advisor such as counsel, general counsel to the investment advisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1675.215" offset="6833683">I submit that is hardly a major legislative move.</text>
            <text syncTime="1682.618" offset="6863254">The other areas in which they acted to strengthen the role of the independent directors consisted of a provision providing that in evaluating the advisory contract the affiliated directors must provide and the unaffiliated directors must receive such information as would be sufficient in order to pass upon the investment advisory contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="1720.294" offset="7014033">I submit that that is hardly an extension over the pre-existing law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1726.476" offset="7038692">The Second Circuit had held in... I believe it was in 1961 in Brown versus Bullock that the approval of an advisory contract must not be merely formal but must evidence a substantive judgment on the part of the directors.</text>

            <text syncTime="1755.407" offset="7154467">The inference that I draw from my view of the legislative history of the 1970 amendment was that this was a concerted effort extending over a period of years beginning as early as 1958 when the Wharton study was commissioned by the SEC under the egis of Congress and continuing right up to 1970.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.196" offset="7277556">There were intermediate reports by the SEC, a special study in 1963, the Public Policy Report in 1966, all of which went to the proposition that there must be effective means for the federal courts to pass upon the propriety of advisory fee compensation in the investment company field and that those effective means were not being provided by the independent directors and could not in the nature of things be provided by the independent directors and that stockholder and SEC action was required to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1846.426" offset="7518509">Let me add to that one important reason why this is so in the investment company field as distinguished from the corporate area generally.</text>
            <text syncTime="1859.784" offset="7571904">Congress was faced with an existing situation where the vast majority of investment companies were managed not by their own internal staffs but by external investment advisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1878.346" offset="7646196">They were extremely dependent upon these external investment advisors because these people had sponsored the fund, they sold shares of the fund, and there was no practical way for the directors, as independent as they might be, to negotiate meaningfully with them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.075" offset="7757059">Congress decided, and they did have an alternative, they could have prohibited external investment advisors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1917.904" offset="7804393">They chose to stay with the existing system.</text>
            <text syncTime="1920.905" offset="7816410">But, in doing so, they said we must take effective means to ensure that this conflict of interest which is built in by the very structure must have a check and balance and that check and balance is an action by the security holder and by the SEC which will be ultimately passed upon by the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1949.934" offset="7932498">Now, I would like to respond to a point raised in Petitioners' reply brief on page one.</text>
            <text syncTime="1966.534" offset="7998953">It was also a point that the First Circuit raised and that is that if a new board of directors comes in and decides to bring an action against an expelled investment advisory, it would be unthinkable that they would be powerless to do so under the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.744" offset="8111802">I would suggest there are three answers to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.154" offset="8125386">The first answer I have already gone into in some length and that is that what we are dealing with here is congressional intent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2009.503" offset="8170839">Never in all of the years preceding the enactment of the 1970 amendment nor in the years since has a board of directors of an investment company brought an action for excessive advisory fees against its investment advisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.389" offset="8266343">This fact was called to Congress' attention during the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.921" offset="8292465">They could not possibly have conceived that this was a realistic possibility in enacting the statute and when the statute is interpreted it must be interpreted against the background of what Congress assumed to be, and rightfully so, the likely situation; where directors of a mutual company are the very ones who have approved the contract that is in issue, and, therefore, it becomes a functionless act to demand them to bring suit against the advisor on a contract that they have already determined presumably to be fair and adequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2091.856" offset="8500191">If, however, there should be such a change in management and a change in heart that the directors of the investment company decide that something must be done about the old investment advisor who is no longer there, they still have two additional remedies.</text>
            <text syncTime="2118.174" offset="8605517">Number one, they could request the SEC to bring an action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.667" offset="8627459">And, I would think that the... It could not be lightly assumed that the SEC in the exercise of its statutory functions would be derelict if the directors did, in fact, have sufficient reason to make that type of request.</text>
            <text syncTime="2145.863" offset="8716276">Finally, I think that in virtually every case, and certainly in the present case, the so-called non-interested directors are usually shareholders.</text>
            <text syncTime="2165.935" offset="8796524">In this case, they are all shareholders of the fund.</text>
            <text syncTime="2170.036" offset="8812929">So, they could bring an action as a shareholder, just as Mr. Fox brought the action in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.371" offset="8846261">They are not powerless.</text>
            <text syncTime="2179.943" offset="8852530">They can act through the means that we have suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="2187.687" offset="8883564">Finally, I would like to stress the point that although we claim that the investment company does not itself have a right of action, and, therefore, under Rule 23.1, which requires merely that an allegation be made concerning demand where a corporation has a right which it fails to assert.</text>
            <text syncTime="2223.153" offset="9025461">In addition to that we also argue that even if the investment company does have a right of action that the intent of Congress and, indeed, the language of this Court in Burks against Lasker suggests that there need be no demand upon the directors to bring the action.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.382" offset="9154297">My adversary refers to the statement in Burks against Lasker as dictum.</text>
            <text syncTime="2266.650" offset="9199437">He refers to the statement as applying merely to a termination case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.325" offset="9238098">Now, the actual language which this Court used and while there were two separate concurring opinions, there were no dissents, so that the decision was unanimous.</text>
            <text syncTime="2295.168" offset="9313435">The language that this Court used was to the effect that when Congress decided to prevent directorial action from cutting off, and those are the words that are used, cutting off shareholder actions, it knew how to do so and it did so in Section 36(b).</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.918" offset="9432449">And, by way of analogy, the Court cited in a footnote, Section 16(b) of the 1934 Act, stating that this Act permits shareholder action notwithstanding the decision of the directors not to bring suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2350.664" offset="9535476">With respect to the suggestion that dispensing with a demand requirement would result in the bringing of unwarranted strike suits, this was an issue that was raised before Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.524" offset="9654908">Congress chose not to be swayed by that argument and, indeed, I think that the demand requirement really has little, if anything, to do with the so-called strike suit.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.787" offset="9727946">The demand requirement is over 100 years old.</text>
            <text syncTime="2402.937" offset="9744560">It can be traced back to Hawes versus Oakland.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.472" offset="9762741">The abuses arising out of shareholder litigation arose in the early part of this century and they were remedied or attempted to be remedied by the most part by providing for... providing that no corporate action could be dismissed, no derivative action could be dismissed absent notice to shareholders and court approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.324" offset="9894085">Those were the methods that were sought to be used to counter the so-called strike suits.</text>
            <text syncTime="2447.617" offset="9923237">I submit that they have been extremely successful.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.120" offset="9945285">Finally, again, although I have said several finales but one further point with respect to this so-called distinction between termination and demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2471.082" offset="10017174">In the Third Circuit case, Weiss versus Temp Fund, Judge Becker was trying to square the decision in that case with the earlier decision of the Third Circuit in Lewis versus Curtis in which the Third Circuit had held that the exact same standards that apply to termination apply to demand.</text>
            <text syncTime="2507.597" offset="10163146">Judge Becker said that he agreed with Lewis versus Curtis insofar as it held that, but said Judge Becker, because this Court in Burks against Lasker applied a conclusive presumption to what he regarded as a termination situation and because the two situations were factual situations he would not apply an equally conclusive presumption to the demand question.</text>
            <text syncTime="2553.946" offset="10348615">Now, I submit that given that the two situations involved, as logic compels that they are involved, namely... The logic that I am referring to is that what we are really asking here is what is the function of the board of directors?</text>
            <text syncTime="2579.805" offset="10452060">It is to exercise a business judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2582.867" offset="10464286">If their business judgment is not to be given weight in a termination situation, then neither should it be given weight in a demand situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2597.137" offset="10521337">And, while Judge Becker attempted to make that distinction in the Weiss case, I suggest that it really doesn't carry very much water and should be rejected by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="2616.388" offset="10598346">Thank you very much.</text>

            <text syncTime="2740.108" offset="11093210">That is quite correct and, in fact, I think that is another reason why it is apparent that no such requirement was intended by Congress in this case because by virtue of the statute virtually every investment company has a majority of unaffiliated directors and that would in effect nullify the statutory purpose behind Section 36(b), which was to, as I said before, give shareholders or security holders indeed and the SEC the right to challenge excessive advisory fees.</text>

            <text syncTime="2786.340" offset="11278157">Yes, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="2788.341" offset="11286202">Mr. Meyer would set at naught or ascribe little value to the independent directors of the mutual fund and suggests that Congress did so in the legislative history.</text>
            <text syncTime="2811.965" offset="11380661">We believe otherwise.</text>
            <text syncTime="2813.936" offset="11388498">Footnote 15 at page 485 of 442 U.S. represents a summation of the legislative history by Justice Brennan in which he concludes with this observation:</text>
            <text syncTime="2833.240" offset="11465716">"Congress surely would not have entrusted such critical functions as approval of advisory contracts and selection of accountants to the statutorily disinterested directors had it shared the Court of Appeals' view that such directors could never be disinterested where their codirectors of investment advisors were concerned. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2859.587" offset="11571146">Similarly at pages 4900 and 4903 of the Senate Report, there is amply supporting reference to our position that a central purpose of these amendments of 1970 was to strengthen the disinterested directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2880.141" offset="11653379">Mr. Meyer seeks to simply treat them as if they are not there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2884.761" offset="11671874">Secondly, Mr. Meyer suggests that if there is no right in the investment company the directors are not rendered powerless because they can go to the SEC and ask them to sue or they can bring an action as shareholders themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2907.337" offset="11762153">Well, that is not consistent with the functions of directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.149" offset="11781379">Directors are to direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2913.912" offset="11788485">They need not go to the SEC under any state corporate law with which I am familiar and ask the SEC to do their work for them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2923.867" offset="11828295">And, similarly there is no requirement that they be shareholders of the investment company in order to serve as directors.</text>
            <text syncTime="2931.574" offset="11859120">Therefore, I suggest that this second solution is inadequate.</text>

            <text syncTime="3329.143" offset="13449350">The final point about Mr. Meyer's argument, the use of Section 16(b) as an analogy, we think is inapt, because Section 16(b) has its own demand rule.</text>

            <text syncTime="3371.171" offset="13617474">The Second Circuit in this case, for whatever reason, seems to have either failed to grasp or decline to follow the logic and spirit of this Court's opinion in Burks and we believe that the Second Circuit should be reversed once again.</text>
