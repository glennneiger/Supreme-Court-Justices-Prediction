            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="159455">Mr. Frey, I think you may proceed when you're ready.</text>

          <turn speaker="andrew_l_frey" startTime="69.977" stopTime="238.087">
            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="69.977" offset="439279">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="72.779" offset="450564">This case is a suit by four individuals... two citizens of the United States and two aliens lawfully present in the United States... for declaratory and injunctive relief challenging the lawfulness of the manner in which the Immigration and Naturalization Service conducted factory surveys at two garment factories in southern California in which the Respondents were employed.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.014" offset="555471">The importance of these factory surveys to the INS' responsibility to attempt to apprehend and deport aliens illegally present in the United States is difficult to overstate.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.558" offset="629659">The record shows that in Los Angeles in 1977 20,000 illegal aliens were apprehended in the course of such surveys, and the Immigration Service has told us that away from the border at the time prior to the decision in this case approximately 60 percent of all apprehensions of illegal aliens occurred in the course of factory surveys.</text>
            <text syncTime="146.660" offset="746061">Now some years ago the factory surveys became during the 1970s a more important tool to the INS for several reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.337" offset="804784">One was a matter of values.</text>
            <text syncTime="164.039" offset="815546">Previously a lot of the enforcement efforts had been concentrated in residential investigations of areas where there were believed to be high concentrations of illegal aliens living, and it was thought that it would be far less intrusive, it would raise fewer Fourth Amendment problems, it would be less intrusive in privacy values for the agency to concentrate on the workplace rather than in residential areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="192.189" offset="928186">Secondly, it was believed... and I think quite plainly accurately... that this was a more effective utilization of the resources of the Service, because a relatively small number of agents were able to make relatively substantial numbers of apprehensions.</text>
            <text syncTime="214.389" offset="1017003">And, thirdly, it was deemed appropriate because the prospect of employment is the principal magnet that draws people to attempt to enter the country illegally and work force surveys and enforcement efforts concentrated on the work force seem correlative to the factors that have drawn the people here.</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="257.949" offset="1191187">Well, the reason I think they do is that these work place surveys are recurrent and at garment factories where these individuals were employed it is likely that there will be, and in fact at Davis Pleating Company there were two surveys during the year in question.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="278.062" offset="1271644">And is that likely to be repeated in the future, assuming the practice?</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="282.616" offset="1289826">It is likely to be repeated if the Ninth Circuit's decision is reversed.</text>
            <text syncTime="285.818" offset="1302678">The consequences of the Ninth Circuit's decision, while factory surveys are still being done, they are very difficult to do at large facilities like Davis Pleating because the restrictions would make it too chaotic, and I'll get to that shortly.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.047" offset="1375612">Now I'd like to briefly describe these surveys.</text>
            <text syncTime="309.600" offset="1397764">First, the first point that I think is significant is that they are not done randomly but they are based on investigations which lead to the acquisition of information that a substantial number of illegal aliens are employed at the particular target factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="328.078" offset="1471742">And indeed the results of the surveys that we have before us in this case indicate this.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.501" offset="1501417">The first Davis survey--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="336.934" offset="1507164">Is there something in the record about that... about the fact that these aren't just random?</text>
            <text syncTime="343.338" offset="1532764">Is there some testimony or anything?</text>

            <label>Mr. Andrew L. Frey</label>
            <text syncTime="345.621" offset="1541855">--Well, I think there is, yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.123" offset="1551886">I think there is an affidavit from one of the INS directors, I believe, that suggest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.776" offset="1570485">Logic would dictate that it would make no sense for them to go about randomly.</text>
            <text syncTime="357.145" offset="1587935">They have very limited resources in terms of personnel to do these things, and they obviously want to utilize them in the most effective way where they can arrest the largest number of people with the smallest number of agents.</text>

            <text syncTime="378.594" offset="1673826">They proceed either by warrant or by consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.629" offset="1685946">I'm told that in about 90 percent of the cases the factory owner or management gives consent to the survey, and where consent is not given a warrant is used.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.318" offset="1728683">In these cases, 78 illegal aliens were arrested in the first Davis survey; 39 in the second; and in the Mr. Pleat survey 45, which was 50 percent of the work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="405.828" offset="1782704">There were 90 workers; 45 were found to be illegal aliens and apprehended.</text>

            <text syncTime="423.456" offset="1853235">Well, the Court of Appeals decision relied for its holding, in part, on the fact that the factories are enclosed and that the exits... that agents were stationed at the exits.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.815" offset="1910704">If you had an outdoor job site you would have a different factual situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="474.438" offset="2057199">This may be a far-out hypothetical.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.626" offset="2073917">Let's suppose you have a study of a given neighborhood and the study was that the probabilities are that... it's a black neighborhood... that 20 to 25 percent of the residents of that neighborhood have committed crimes.</text>
            <text syncTime="496.421" offset="2145075">That's all.</text>
            <text syncTime="498.788" offset="2154583">And then the police launch a program to stop and interrogate on a random basis all of the blacks in the neighborhood.</text>

            <text syncTime="513.098" offset="2211844">I think that would pose some interesting and difficult questions whether... if you had this abstract 20 or 25 percent probability that the individual you stopped had committed a crime but no specific information.</text>
            <text syncTime="527.607" offset="2269835">Martinez-Fuerte was a case somewhat like that, and I think that that is not at all involved in this case because there are no individual seizures of particular workers based on... not based on information specifically relating to those workers.</text>

            <text syncTime="1221.571" offset="5045711">Well, I wanted to talk a bit about what evidence there is in this case, what allegations there are in the complaint, and what evidence there is in the deposition testimony of anything that might be argued, and my opponents do argue, are in some instances Fourth Amendment violations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1242.234" offset="5128363">First of all, in the first amended complaint there was an allegation that an individual who was then a plaintiff in the case was asked whether he was a citizen and said he was a citizen and was nevertheless taken away and deported, although he was a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1261.129" offset="5203909">I would agree that this allegation would state a very likely violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1267.968" offset="5231285">It turned out, however, that he had to be withdrawn as a plaintiff from the case because he was an illegal alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1273.706" offset="5254273">Now there is also the instance that Respondent Delgado complains about.</text>
            <text syncTime="1283.144" offset="5291994">In the conversation with Delgado the agent approached him and said are you a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.298" offset="5316549">He said yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="1289.815" offset="5318639">He said where were you born.</text>
            <text syncTime="1291.583" offset="5325744">Mayaguez, Puerto Rico.</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.633" offset="5329924">He moved on.</text>
            <text syncTime="1294.119" offset="5335879">Then, according to Delgado, he heard the agent, one agent say to another agent... this is at Joint Appendix 94...</text>
            <text syncTime="1305.475" offset="5381333">"I heard him say, he said, 'when we come back we're going to have to check them closer. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1314.699" offset="5418217">This was one of the things that is complained of by our opponents in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1321.202" offset="5444235">How this amounts to a Fourth Amendment violation, I don't understand.</text>
            <text syncTime="1325.888" offset="5462939">Respondent Miramontes complains that she was frightened by the survey because when she was approached she was asked if she was an alien and she said she was... she's a lawful resident alien.</text>
            <text syncTime="1336.796" offset="5506616">She was asked for her papers and she momentarily thought that she did not have her papers on her person, as she is required by law to do, and she was afraid that she might be arrested for not having her papers, although in fact she did have her papers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1351.539" offset="5565548">She produced them and they moved on to somebody else.</text>
            <text syncTime="1353.908" offset="5575057">Now this amounts to a mere fear that the agents would act in conformity with the Fourth Amendment if she gave them cause to do so by giving them probable cause to arrest her.</text>
            <text syncTime="1367.565" offset="5629705">Then there is an incident described in the testimony of an INS agent at page 158 of the Joint Appendix and relied on by our opponents in which he describes a case in which someone went running out of the factory to the parking lot to a car and he watched this person because he did not want him to get in the car and drive off, but the person then returned to the factory and he didn't do anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1394.235" offset="5736389">There was no seizure of any individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1396.735" offset="5746315">The fact of the matter is that this individual was allowed to go out of the factory unimpeded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1401.471" offset="5765333">Finally... and this is repeated many times in Respondents' brief... there is one incident which is not in the Joint Appendix which is at page 27 of Respondent Miramontes' testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="1415.481" offset="5821339">She was asked:</text>
            <text syncTime="1419.366" offset="5836908">"Did you hear anyone answering that they were American citizens? "</text>
            <text syncTime="1422.135" offset="5847984">Answer:</text>

            <text syncTime="1429.472" offset="5877241">"He was handcuffed. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1430.908" offset="5882988">"He let him go and then I don't know what happened. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1437.428" offset="5909111">Now it is conceivable that somewhere in that interaction between agent and employee there may have been a Fourth Amendment violation, but, of course, Miramontes doesn't know what caused the agent--</text>

            <text syncTime="1492.460" offset="6129271">Now these are summarized in the permanent injunction and declaratory judgment which I sent up to the Court on Monday.</text>
            <text syncTime="1503.434" offset="6173156">It's just a convenient summary of what the Court of Appeals relied on, and it's at page 2 of the judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.140" offset="6211922">First, investigators placed in doorways, and that is, among these factors, I think the only one that is significant and, of course, our position with respect to that factor is that any citizen or lawful alien would have... it's perfectly obvious what the investigators are placed in the doorways for, and the evidence suggests they don't actually block the doorways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1540.143" offset="6319964">They are just visible in the doorways.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.593" offset="6325816">And that is that when the survey begins there are often cries of "L'emigra", people running and hiding.</text>

            <text syncTime="1599.648" offset="6557992">In fact, the instructions that the agents have are when someone seeks to leave the factory, if they have a reasonable suspicion of illegal alienage they are to detain them and ask them questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1610.839" offset="6602714">They may otherwise ask them a question, a non-detentive one.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.691" offset="6622149">Now, second, the number of investigators utilized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1618.976" offset="6635315">Well, when you have a factory with two or three hundred employees, like Davis Pleating, to use 35 or 20 investigators, some of whom are stationed outside, seems to us quite reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1630.884" offset="6682962">Third, the surprise nature of the operation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1634.003" offset="6695396">Well, this reminds me of the argument in Dalia against the United States that you had to give notice to the individual when you were placing a bug in his office.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.477" offset="6737297">Obviously these operations have to be by surprise.</text>
            <text syncTime="1647.495" offset="6749417">The methodical questioning of workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="1651.030" offset="6763524">Well, that's what they're there for.</text>
            <text syncTime="1653.916" offset="6775017">The verbal announcement of INS authority and the display of badges.</text>
            <text syncTime="1658.386" offset="6792990">I dare say that if they had come in without badges and without announcing who they were and what they were doing, I would certainly find that more offensive and I suspect the Court of Appeals would, too.</text>
            <text syncTime="1670.527" offset="6841473">The carrying or use of handcuffs, something that is obviously reasonable since they are going to be arresting a large number of people, not all of whom will be cooperative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1679.633" offset="6877940">And, finally, the apprehension of fleeing co-workers in the sight of the work force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1684.168" offset="6896121">Well, if they can't apprehend co-workers in the sight of the work force, what they have to do is create a situation in which they are induced to run out of the workplace and be arrested outside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1698.027" offset="6951501">Now this is a prescription for chaos, not for conformity with the Fourth Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.081" offset="6971772">I have one other thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1705.198" offset="6980235">I urge you particularly to look at page 130 of the Joint Appendix and the testimony of Miramontes because she was questioned there about what was really bothering her about the surveys.</text>
            <text syncTime="1716.656" offset="7026002">And what bothered her about the surveys was, first of all, the fact that these illegal alien workers who were arrested had not committed any crime, in her view, and it disturbed her that they were being arrested and deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.886" offset="7102906">And I don't think it's a party for the Immigration Service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.588" offset="7117744">It is a sad situation that these people have to be deported.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.373" offset="7128924">It is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment; it is an enforcement of the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1747.027" offset="7147524">It also disturbed her that citizens are not required to produce identification and lawful resident aliens are required.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.347" offset="7180751">Now again I can understand why that might be annoying, but that is the law and it is not a violation of the Fourth Amendment.</text>

            <label>Mr. Henry R. Fenton</label>
            <text syncTime="1934.264" offset="7896506">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1937.283" offset="7908523">This case concerns the constitutionality under the Fourth Amendment of INS workplace surveys or raids which are carried on on a nationwide basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.139" offset="7947915">The government concedes that the three surveys that are at issue in this case were carried out substantially in the same way as they carry out surveys throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="1957.864" offset="7990861">We submit that as part of that program of INS surveys the Respondents... two United States citizens born in this country and two legal resident aliens, one of whom has resided here since 1944 and was raised in this country, the other of whom resided in this country for some 15 years at the time of the surveys in 1977... were seized and were questioned along with their co-workers in three surveys that occurred in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1988.899" offset="8114995">My argument is basically divided into three parts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1991.835" offset="8126697">First, I will argue that the Respondents were seized; secondly, that they were unreasonably seized; and, finally, that the appropriate standard for seizure in such a setting is reasonable suspicion of illegal alienage.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.595" offset="8189809">Now I think that any common sense appraisal of the record indicates that these people were actually seized and that they are seized in the course of these surveys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.037" offset="8239546">In excess of 20 and perhaps as many as 30 INS officers took part in the surveys.</text>
            <text syncTime="2028.441" offset="8273192">In one of the surveys they were accompanied by uniformed Los Angeles Police Department agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2033.328" offset="8292732">Now they entered into the factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2037.130" offset="8307883">They came in suddenly.</text>
            <text syncTime="2038.066" offset="8311644">There was no notice to the employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="2039.916" offset="8319063">And some of them immediately stationed themselves inside the factory, in the doorways, so that the employees could see that they were there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.707" offset="8358247">There was no question about that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2050.957" offset="8363262">In fact, Respondents... the record is clear that Respondents said that they saw the agents position themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.812" offset="8394609">For example, Delgado said that, 82...</text>
            <text syncTime="2068.085" offset="8431703">"I started looking up toward the front and then I seen people with badges being stationed by the doors. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.037" offset="8447586">"They wouldn't let nobody go out. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2073.989" offset="8455318">And then Delgado described that five people were stopped at the doorway by INS agents and were prevented from going in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.909" offset="8483008">Mrs. Miramontes, another Respondent, in another survey... again this is at the beginning of the survey even before the questioning begins... saw somebody try and go out and the agent responded INS retained a portion of the tee-shirt.</text>

            <text syncTime="2326.633" offset="9465943">Well, Your Honor, I think that the Ninth... the importance of it is that these surveys are continuing and the fact of the matter is that it wasn't just these individual Respondents who were seized but it was everybody in the factory.</text>
            <text syncTime="2345.360" offset="9540862">The law suit was brought on behalf of the union and the workers that it represented, everyone in those factories.</text>
            <text syncTime="2351.331" offset="9564686">The union really is technically a party, although the Ninth Circuit didn't deal with the question of the dismissal of the union.</text>
            <text syncTime="2359.687" offset="9598123">So we think that it is important that in addition to the Respondents the other people were seized as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.924" offset="9627066">But we submit that these Respondents were seized and that it was apparent to them that they couldn't leave.</text>
            <text syncTime="2372.495" offset="9649427">Now Mr. Frey suggests that two people walked out the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="2376.296" offset="9664578">I think the record really doesn't suggest that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2380.367" offset="9680879">What happened was in one instance Mrs. Correa, after the questioning was over, mustered up the courage to walk over and talk to an INS agent, but she never left the custody of any of the INS agents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2393.741" offset="9734377">So there was really never any attempt to leave and get away when INS agents were present.</text>
            <text syncTime="2400.514" offset="9761440">The other situation involved Mr. Delgado, and the record simply reflects that he either directed someone to go to the loading dock or he himself went to the loading dock.</text>
            <text syncTime="2410.287" offset="9800519">But, once again, the crucial point is that he never tried to leave, nor did he leave the custody of the INS agents in the factory because he felt compelled to remain not only because of the people who were stationed there, but because there was a large force of agents who were systematically questioning people in a manner which would suggest that everyone was under suspicion and everyone must remain.</text>

            <text syncTime="4059.062" offset="16395602">Given the results that we've had at these places, they are likely targets.</text>
            <text syncTime="4063.014" offset="16411484">Let me just... Justice Brennan raised the question of Davis against Mississippi and I do think that that is a very different case, because you have to distinguish between this hypothetical group seizure that's gone on here and the question of the seizure and arrest in Davis against Mississippi of an individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="4084.693" offset="16498211">And I agree that you would need probable cause, under Dunaway against New York, a well settled law,... to arrest an individual you would need reasonable suspicion, as in Cortez, to make a seizure of a particular individual suspected of an offense, suspected of being subject to a seizure.</text>
            <text syncTime="4103.555" offset="16573653">But this theoretical seizure of the entire work force is a totally different animal.</text>
            <text syncTime="4108.976" offset="16595282">And the point that Justice Stevens was getting at with my colleague, suppose that they had identified 39 people on the second day of a survey by name who were present and they had gotten a warrant naming those 39 people.</text>
            <text syncTime="4124.385" offset="16656931">They would still have employed precisely the same procedures to prevent those people from running out and hiding and to try to identify who they were.</text>
            <text syncTime="4134.193" offset="16696219">And under the reasoning of the Ninth Circuit, even if they had a warrant based on probable cause they would still be violating the Fourth Amendment rights of all the other people in the workplace.</text>
