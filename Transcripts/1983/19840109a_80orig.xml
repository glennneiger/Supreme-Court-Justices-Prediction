            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="144454">We will hear arguments first this morning in State of Colorado against the State of New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="7.837" offset="175801">Mr. Simms, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_a_simms" startTime="12.491" stopTime="226.761">
            <label>Mr. Richard A. Simms</label>
            <text syncTime="12.491" offset="194400">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="15.693" offset="207148">The question before the Court is whether Colorado has met the burden of establishing a basis in fact which would warrant an award of water for a future use in Colorado on a river that has been fully appropriated and used in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.237" offset="285306">The Master's Report before the Court simply adopts Colorado's case.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.041" offset="304532">Colorado's case, however, does not begin to meet the standard of preponderance in ordinary civil actions much less the standard of clear and convincing evidence in original actions between states.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.051" offset="360643">The Master has recommended an award of 4,000 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="59.555" offset="382586">The bottom line of that recommendation is his conclusion that there would be no injury in New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="67.692" offset="415187">That conclusion depends upon three interdependent factual predicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.214" offset="441310">The first of those is that the acreage in New Mexico must be cut in half.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.718" offset="471298">That is, the acreage that New Mexico users are ready, willing and able to irrigate must be cut in half.</text>
            <text syncTime="88.272" offset="497525">As part of that predicate the Canadian River users of Vermejo water must not even be considered by the Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="96.145" offset="528976">The reduced acreage on the main stem of the Vermejo in the 1970's must not have been caused by water shortage.</text>
            <text syncTime="104.567" offset="562622">The New Mexico water users must not have been diligent, and the Court will, therefore, protect only 5,300 acres in New Mexico instead of 9,100 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.660" offset="623017">Secondly, and additionally there must be in New Mexico reasonable conservation measures which would effectively manufacture or make available or augment the supply by 4,000 acre-feet at the diversion points in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.305" offset="697623">Thirdly, and again additionally the future use of the benefits that would derive therefrom must be reasonably certain and comparatively unquestionable.</text>
            <text syncTime="150.548" offset="746629">All three of these factual predicates are essential to the Master's Report.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.285" offset="773587">If one of those predicates fails, Colorado's case fails and the Master's Report fails.</text>
            <text syncTime="165.122" offset="804934">We believe the case fails on all three predicates.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.990" offset="824369">The bottom line I believe in this case generally is that there simply is not enough water in the Vermejo River to make it possible to make an award to Colorado for a future use.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.267" offset="885496">In the Court's first decision in this case the Court indicated two ways in which it might be possible to apportion water: first, augmentation of supply in two ways, either through water conservation or through the effective forfeiture of water rights not diligently exercised; secondly, the Court indicated that through a balancing of benefit to the future use in Colorado against detriment to the cessation of the existing uses in New Mexico an award might be made to Colorado.</text>

            <label>Justice Sandra Day O'Connor</label>
            <text syncTime="226.761" offset="1051425">Mr. Simms, on the first point and the way in which water can be augmented, how can New Mexico legitimately claim that nonuse over a thirty-year period never becomes in effect an abandonment of the use of a certain portion of the water?</text>
            <text syncTime="258.132" offset="1176918">Is it your position that New Mexico can never by nonuse lose the right to use the water?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="richard_a_simms" startTime="268.004" stopTime="405.743">
            <label>Mr. Richard A. Simms</label>
            <text syncTime="268.004" offset="1216415">Not at all, and I think the Court's first instruction to the Master in the first area of evidence taking suggests the answer to the question, Justice O'Connor.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.211" offset="1261241">The Court said that to determine the existing uses you must look at present levels of use, and balance on the one hand shortage of water against the possible inference on the other hand of lack of diligence on the part of the water users.</text>
            <text syncTime="298.959" offset="1340235">We presented the evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="301.077" offset="1348699">Colorado did not present the evidence to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.544" offset="1358625">New Mexico did present the evidence to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.144" offset="1368970">That evidence indicates that for the Vermejo Conservancy District as an example... I presume that they are the users to whom you are referring.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.356" offset="1433858">In there after the District was rehabilitated in 1955 there was a ten-year development period.</text>
            <text syncTime="330.277" offset="1465518">That did not end until 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.479" offset="1482341">In an ordinary reclamation project you would not expect the water users during that period to have developed their water rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.685" offset="1519122">They are given that period of time within which to do it.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.287" offset="1529571">Right after that as the evidence shows the water supply dropped off substantially.</text>
            <text syncTime="352.441" offset="1554126">The way in which you instructed the Master to provide the factual information to the Court is the same way a water right entitlement is adjudicated in most every western state.</text>
            <text syncTime="364.683" offset="1603132">They will look at historic use, an adjudication court will, and balance on the one hand times of shortage so that nonuse might be excused and on the other hand the possible lack of diligence.</text>
            <text syncTime="381.544" offset="1670527">Here you can make no inference of lack of diligence out of the contractual development period.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.464" offset="1698217">Once that stopped, once that was over there is a drought on the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.185" offset="1721101">Consequently, while the water users are still ready, willing and able to use the water supply, the water supply simply is not there.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="405.742" offset="1767390">Mr. Simms, let me interrupt if I may for a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.313" offset="1785675">The Master in dealing with the finding of drought says New Mexico claims that the nonuse on the part of the District is caused by the drought in the early seventies.</text>
            <text syncTime="420.419" offset="1826113">However, the drought in the 1970's cannot be responsible for the nonuse which has existed in the District since its formation in the fifties, nonuse through a time period when all of the other users in evidence from flow tables found sufficient water available.</text>
            <text syncTime="434.095" offset="1880761">So he is finding for a substantial period before what you say was the drought.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Richard A. Simms</label>
            <text syncTime="438.314" offset="1897688">Early in the fifties.</text>
            <text syncTime="441.766" offset="1911481">See, the Vermejo Conservancy District was rehabilitated.</text>
            <text syncTime="444.785" offset="1923497">That was finished in 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.153" offset="1933006">Prior to then there was a much larger irrigation project, nearly twice as many acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.056" offset="1956621">It was all torn apart.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.425" offset="1962054">The canals were rebuilt.</text>
            <text syncTime="455.625" offset="1966861">Some reservoirs were taken out.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.127" offset="1972921">New reservoirs were put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="459.027" offset="1980549">New lands were leveled or were to be leveled.</text>
            <text syncTime="462.512" offset="1994446">The whole place was rearranged.</text>
            <text syncTime="464.781" offset="2003536">So in 1955 there began a ten-year period within which to develop up to the potential of the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="472.404" offset="2034047">Actually it was seven years.</text>
            <text syncTime="474.520" offset="2042511">It was later amended and became ten.</text>
            <text syncTime="476.189" offset="2049198">At the end of that development period is when the drought years began.</text>
            <text syncTime="483.778" offset="2079501">The problem with the Master's assessment... The Master says he looks at the flow records or the flow charts.</text>
            <text syncTime="491.015" offset="2108444">What he does is look at Table 2 in his second report to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="497.852" offset="2135821">We invite the Court to look at Table 2.</text>
            <text syncTime="500.287" offset="2145538">Table.2 is the average discharge for every month of every year from 1916 until now.</text>
            <text syncTime="508.060" offset="2176676">The Master looks at that, but he does no do anything else.</text>
            <text syncTime="512.262" offset="2193499">He does not compare those figures with anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.381" offset="2201963">That is the end of the Master's analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.468" offset="2222234">That is the beginning of New Mexico's analysis.</text>
            <text syncTime="522.987" offset="2236340">What you have to do is take those figures and do a water accounting down the river below the Dawson gauge where he gets the figures.</text>
            <text syncTime="532.008" offset="2272389">You have to add accretions, subtract depletions and carry those figures, carry that water supply down to the farmer's land in order to find out how much water is available on the land.</text>
            <text syncTime="545.685" offset="2327141">If, for example, you look at the year 1950... and the Master has told the Court he finds no time of material deficiency or intermittent supply by looking at those figures... but look at 1950 in his chart.</text>
            <text syncTime="561.212" offset="2389208">If you add up the discharge for the year you will find the first figure in New Mexico's Exhibit F-29.</text>
            <text syncTime="570.383" offset="2425884">That figure is 4,800 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.419" offset="2442080">If you do a water budget and take that down the river to the land, you end up with 1,600 acre-feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.791" offset="2479592">The Master says that is sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="585.893" offset="2487951">He is explaining to the Court that that is sufficient to irrigate 7,380 acres.</text>
            <text syncTime="592.731" offset="2515327">We believe that is patently incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="595.349" offset="2525776">If you were to do it for the year 1951 you would end up with nothing on the farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.855" offset="2551794">If you were to do it for 1956 you would end up with nothing on the farms.</text>
            <text syncTime="607.407" offset="2574051">Then there were some good years following 1955.</text>
            <text syncTime="614.162" offset="2601009">The problem there, though, was the development of the District.</text>
            <text syncTime="619.566" offset="2622638">Once the District development period was over you get back into drought years, and if you follow through on Exhibit F-29 and do this water budget accounting, which Colorado never provided and the Master never did, you will find out that the river is very, very short in the seventies.</text>
            <text syncTime="639.612" offset="2702887">The evidence in that regard is overwhelming.</text>
            <text syncTime="643.782" offset="2719501">It is the bulk of the evidence in the record.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.799" offset="2727546">If you were to compare the monthly USGS flows to demand from 1916 to now, that supports New Mexico.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.589" offset="2766730">The Bureau of Reclamation testified in this case, including its regional director and its area engineer.</text>
            <text syncTime="663.160" offset="2797032">Both are personally familiar with the operation of the Vermejo Conservancy District.</text>
            <text syncTime="668.397" offset="2818034">They testified to the shortages.</text>
            <text syncTime="670.499" offset="2826394">Their testimony is unimpeached.</text>
            <text syncTime="672.951" offset="2836216">Indeed, in this regard it was not even cross examined.</text>
            <text syncTime="675.487" offset="2846351">The water users, all of them, testified to this shortage.</text>

            <text syncTime="1426.987" offset="5852314">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1431.772" offset="5871540">This Court in its opinion in this case set forth two basic principles or considerations that apply particularly to this case: first, that reasonable conservation measures in one state may offset the effect of a diversion, a new diversion, in another state; secondly, that benefits in one state may outweigh harm in another state.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.207" offset="5993270">It is Colorado's position that the Special Master has found and that the evidence fully supports the conclusion that reasonable conservation measures in New Mexico in the Vermejo Conservancy District, for example, would and in fact already have offset the effect of a Colorado diversion and further that if there should be any residual harm to New Mexico, which Colorado does not believe there would be, that this harm would be outweighed by benefits to Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="1496.112" offset="6128898">The conservation measure that has already been completed is one of the most blatant cases of waste that there could be.</text>
            <text syncTime="1507.920" offset="6176127">It results from the District stock water system procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1513.407" offset="6198070">That procedure is fully described in our briefs, of course, and in New Mexico's own Exhibit E-3.</text>
            <text syncTime="1521.413" offset="6230044">The District released annually over 2,000 acre-feet of water from its reservoirs for the purpose of supplying water for livestock.</text>
            <text syncTime="1531.786" offset="6271527">The livestock consumed about 35 acre-feet of water a year.</text>
            <text syncTime="1536.755" offset="6291380">So as you can see there was over a 98 percent loss of water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1541.409" offset="6310083">This waste continued during the period that the District complained of a water shortage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.647" offset="6334952">It has now as of last year been eliminated by the installation of a closed stock water system... I should say closed water system... because the main thrust really of this new water system as explained in this New Mexico Exhibit E-3 is to supply domestic water.</text>
            <text syncTime="1570.679" offset="6427112">That was how it apparently got started, to supply water to 20 homes and then it expanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.784" offset="6463579">But this saving of 2,000 acre-feet of water at the reservoirs will completely offset the effect of the Colorado diversion of 4,000 acre-feet at the river.</text>
            <text syncTime="1594.711" offset="6523243">The reason for that is mathematically very simple.</text>

            <text syncTime="2125.788" offset="8647520">Now New Mexico in its brief on remand represented to the Special Master... this was after it was remanded to him for the additional findings... represented to the Special Master that the period prior to the seventies was a period of stable supply for irrigation.</text>

            <text syncTime="2161.061" offset="8788686">He did not necessarily accept that, but he noted that even prior to that period the District did not irrigate substantially more water.</text>

            <text syncTime="2568.408" offset="10417995">--Well, I was going to get to the point, Justice Rehnquist, that the figures that the Special Master set forth in his report in his additional findings as to the amount of water coming to the District from other sources were about 45 percent.</text>
            <text syncTime="2585.869" offset="10487899">The District, in other words, gets about 35 percent of its water from the Chico Ricco and 10 percent from creeks which flow into the District's system.</text>
            <text syncTime="2596.225" offset="10529277">So the water that the District gets from the Vermejo is only a little over half of its total supply.</text>
            <text syncTime="2604.331" offset="10561773">Those other sources, of course, would not be affected in any way by the Colorado diversion, but I wanted to suggest this again that the diverters on the Vermejo other than the District would not be affected even in a low flow year because all but one are irrigators and the monthly figures at the Dawson gauge even in the low flow years show that there is sufficient water for that purpose.</text>

            <text syncTime="2647.860" offset="10735853">Well, I suggest that the Special Master very properly recognized that as being cumulative and cumulative in a way of minor significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.953" offset="10796248">New Mexico's exhibit F-29 gave a thirty-year picture of the spills at the Vermejo Conservancy District headgate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2673.808" offset="10839612">It showed that in only two years in a thirty-year period were there significant spills.</text>
            <text syncTime="2680.914" offset="10868033">Now, the new evidence that New Mexico proposed to the Special Master covered the years '81 and '82, and that evidence according to their offer of proof would have shown more than 4,000 acre-feet of water spilling past the District headgate in each of those years.</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.126" offset="10944937">That is particular significant because that is more than the Colorado entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2705.094" offset="10964790">They got the evidence in in effect because it is at page 50 of their brief, one of these charts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2712.434" offset="10994152">It shows that on only one day in 1981 did the spills exceed the capacity of the District canal, 600 cubic feet per second.</text>
            <text syncTime="2723.639" offset="11038978">Now Mr. Moots has testified that the District will start to spill at 450 cubic feet per second, but this evidence showed that the spills exceeded... the amount of water there exceeded 450 cubic feet per second on only one day.</text>
            <text syncTime="2741.351" offset="11109822">So this was water that the District was entitled to take and it could have taken presumably if its diversion system had been efficient according to its own testimony.</text>
            <text syncTime="2755.111" offset="11164888">So I suggest that that is the basic reason that the Special Master did not take that, the basic reason being that it was simply cumulative.</text>

            <text syncTime="3013.661" offset="12199024">I am relating it, Justice Marshall, to the question of conservation which I believe is up here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3023.267" offset="12237476">We felt that the pronouncements of this Court regarding protecting wasteful practices were particularly relevant to this question of conservation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.658" offset="12283034">Now there is another area that administration would have protected and dealt with that would have been a benefit to the Vermejo Conservancy District, and that is the overuse of water by other diverters.</text>
            <text syncTime="3049.167" offset="12341025">There was no administration and no surveillance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3052.017" offset="12352519">These other diverters were senior, had senior priorities, and there were not any records... the Special Master noted that... because of the absence of administration, but the interesting thing was that when one measurement was made as shown by a New Mexico exhibit, A-130, the seepage run on the Vermejo had shown the Phelps Dodge lessee irrigating after what New Mexico's own exhibit had said was the irrigation season, after September 15th, and using an amount of water, 300 acre-feet, which would have been equivalent to the total annual entitlement of that diverter.</text>
            <text syncTime="3095.462" offset="12526286">So this is the sort of thing that could have been dealt with and would have been dealt with by proper administration certainly in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="3104.718" offset="12563275">All of these factors, I suggest, are ones that the Special Master took into account.</text>
            <text syncTime="3111.490" offset="12590338">He noted also, and I would like to emphasize this in closing, the great benefits to Colorado and the Purgatory, the fact that the City of Trinidad needed water... the City of Trinidad put a moratorium on water taps... the fact that there was 29,000 acres of land, irrigable land, in the Purgatory Valley, 19,000 in the District and 10,000 above the district that needed water.</text>
            <text syncTime="3143.979" offset="12720323">The water was needed for coal washing purposes, for industrial development.</text>
            <text syncTime="3148.831" offset="12739758">He put that together with the picture of water administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3153.167" offset="12757104">One of the questions this Court propounded was, would there be conservation in Colorado, and he concluded that there would be because of the Colorado picture on water administration.</text>
            <text syncTime="3164.625" offset="12802870">So the benefits to Colorado, it is our position, of course, that with conservation measures dealing with the overuse, with the silting in the District canals and particularly this conservation measure that has been completed with the domestic water system which eliminates the 2,000 acre-foot waste, it is our contention that there will be no harm to New Mexico resulting from the Colorado diversion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3192.542" offset="12914570">But if there should be, the Special Master eminently concluded that any such harm would be outweighed by these benefits to Colorado, and that, we feel, Justice Marshall, fits into both the concepts and, as I say, the principles that were announced in the last paragraph of the Court's decision.</text>

            <text syncTime="3260.920" offset="13188124">So we suggested that there be that limitation that Colorado could not take anything below the points of diversion specified in the Colorado decree, and that along with that there be this ten-year running average which is used in Nebraska v. Wyoming, for example, and also used in the Colorado River compact.</text>

            <text syncTime="3349.645" offset="13542972">First of all, Colorado says that there is an Exhibit E-3.</text>
            <text syncTime="3356.481" offset="13570348">That exhibit has in it a figure of 2,000 acre-feet that could be saved if a closed stock water pipeline were put in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.920" offset="13604098">If you translate that 2,000 acre-feet in the reservoirs of the Vermejo Conservancy District into 4,000 acre-feet through all of the efficiency coefficients in route to 4,000 acre-feet at the diversion points in Colorado.</text>
            <text syncTime="3381.716" offset="13671285">As a matter of fact, that 2,000 figure is 2,145.</text>
            <text syncTime="3388.603" offset="13698766">It was estimated in that exhibit by taking the month of November, finding out how much water was released then after the irrigation season was over and when all of the canals were dry and multiplying it by nine.</text>

            <text syncTime="3409.968" offset="13784238">The fact of the matter is and according to the unimpeached testimony of Colorado if you look at their Table 4 of their exhibit number 6 the average amount of water released during the period of the life of the District has been 790 acre-feet, not 2,000 acre-feet.</text>
