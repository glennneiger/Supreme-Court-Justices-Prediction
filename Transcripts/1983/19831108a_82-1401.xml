            <label>Mr. John G. Kester</label>
            <text syncTime="22.709" offset="236501">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.694" offset="240471">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, this case is quite different from the one you just heard, although both involve personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.471" offset="275580">In that case, the central issue, which apparently was the one, the only addressed by the courts below, was jurisdiction over a publishing company.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.421" offset="315286">This case, however, concerns exclusively two individual corporate employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="48.731" offset="340572">It is not an appeal by a publisher.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.042" offset="349768">The corporate publisher here, the National Enquirer, Incorporated, is a Florida corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="57.306" offset="374845">It consented to the jurisdiction of the California courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="61.804" offset="392817">It is the publisher's employees, who are two residents of Florida, who have brought this appeal to this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="68.050" offset="417895">The plaintiff below, who is the appellee here, is Shirley Jones, a television actress.</text>
            <text syncTime="73.985" offset="441614">She and her husband complained that they were both libeled by an article in the National Enquirer that said that her husband's behavior was driving her to drink.</text>
            <text syncTime="82.841" offset="477036">Later, her husband dropped his complaint.</text>
            <text syncTime="84.951" offset="485500">Later still, Ms. Jones amended her complaint to say that she complains now only about two sentences in the article, two sentences that said that her drinking had occurred at her place of work and interfered with her work.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="97.337" offset="535028">Mr. Kester, does the record show why the husband dismissed his--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="john_g_kester" startTime="101.850" stopTime="284.088">
            <label>Mr. John G. Kester</label>
            <text syncTime="101.850" offset="553000">That is not in the record, Mr. Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.457" offset="571495">The plaintiffs sued the National Inquirer in a Los Angeles state court for $20 million, $10 million compensatory damages and another $10 million punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="118.562" offset="619874">She also sued in the same complaint John South, a National Enquirer employee whose by-line was on the story that the Enquirer published, and Ian Calder, who was the editor and the president of the National Enquirer, the Number Two man in its corporate organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.633" offset="692181">As I said, the Enquirer consented to jurisdiction in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.363" offset="715064">The case has not yet gone to trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.333" offset="723005">Calder and South, who are the appellants here, were served by mailing copies of the complaint to them from Florida addressed to them... from California, however, addressed to them in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="155.719" offset="768563">They entered special appearances in California to contest the jurisdiction of the California court.</text>
            <text syncTime="161.716" offset="792491">The Superior Court of Los Angeles County cited this Court's decisions in International Shoe against Washington, Culco against Superior Court of California, and Worldwide Volkswagen against Woodson, along with the First Amendment, and held that it did not have jurisdiction personally over these two Florida individuals, and it commented that really all that they would add to the California suit would be an opportunity for the plaintiff to try to collect additional punitive damage from them personally.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.702" offset="928432">Ms. Jones appealed that ruling.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.404" offset="939299">The California Court of Appeals sustained her position.</text>
            <text syncTime="202.091" offset="954032">It held that these two Florida individuals were required to come defend themselves in the California court.</text>
            <text syncTime="208.807" offset="980886">I will discuss its reasons in more detail in a moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="211.805" offset="992902">The Court of Appeal in California said it made this holding even though it found, and I quote,</text>
            <text syncTime="218.132" offset="1018189">"It may not be said that defendants' activities in California are extensive, wide-ranging, substantial, continuous, or systematic. "</text>
            <text syncTime="228.032" offset="1057790">The case comes before this Court on appeal rather than certiorari because the two individuals challenged in the lower courts the constitutionality of California's long arm jurisdiction statute as applied to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="241.512" offset="1111707">That statute is Section 410.10 of the California Civil Procedure Code, and this Court has jurisdiction under 28 USC 1257.2 and the Dahnke-Walker Milling Company doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.288" offset="1170848">I don't intend to address that aspect of the case further unless the Court wishes.</text>
            <text syncTime="261.535" offset="1191746">Now, the question in this case is very simple and straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.298" offset="1210868">It is whether the editor and the writer here, who never entered California in connection with this article, can be sued personally in California nevertheless.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.826" offset="1252977">It is whether the Constitution permits California to assert jurisdiction in a libel case not just over--</text>

            <text syncTime="290.195" offset="1306476">Now, where the record stands on that is that there is an uncontradicted affidavit from the writer saying that he never entered California in connection with this story.</text>

            <text syncTime="1504.423" offset="6163371">I think there is a case written 20 some years ago by Judge Friendly in which he suggested that the First Amendment certainly has a constitutional role in cases of this sort, but he said, why not turn forum non-convenience into a constitutional doctrine and deal with it at that point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.320" offset="6246963">I would suggest to you that as a practical matter there is a lot wrong with that approach, even though logically it seems fine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.912" offset="6277265">In the first place, forum non-convenience, as the term implies, is an inconvenient forum, and jurisdiction is more than a matter of convenience, as this Court has said many times.</text>
            <text syncTime="1544.079" offset="6321986">As a practical matter, to assert forum non-convenience, you have to come into the court, you have to submit to the jurisdiction, and then you have to try to convince the local judge that he is not a convenient person to hear the case.</text>

            <text syncTime="1635.448" offset="6687387">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court, I think Mr. Kester's presentation is indicative of the briefs that have been filed in terms of the differences in the perception of the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1648.146" offset="6738274">We feel that a more thorough view of the facts are essential to see exactly what Mr. Calder's and Mr. South's contacts with California were.</text>
            <text syncTime="1659.641" offset="6784249">First, Mr. Kester has referred to Mr. Calder as an employee of the Enquirer.</text>
            <text syncTime="1665.248" offset="6806610">In fact, not only was he the editor, but he was also the president of the Enquirer and the second person in command.</text>
            <text syncTime="1672.199" offset="6834404">He in deposition testimony acknowledged that the was in fact the person who oversaw the entire functioning of the Enquirer, including its editorial function.</text>
            <text syncTime="1683.414" offset="6879335">So, we are not dealing with an individual who was just remotely related or involved in the control of the publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1690.816" offset="6908906">Additionally, the evidence that was adduced in the court below makes it clear that he also had significant involvement in this particular article.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.672" offset="6948298">So we have combined in Mr. Calder both the elements of a general control of the publication and at the same time specific involvement in this article, and that involvement included awareness of the fact that Mr. Engles on behalf of himself and his wife had denied the truthfulness of the publication prior to publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1723.615" offset="7040145">He was also the person who had seen the page proof of the article before publication, the evaluation of the article before publication, and in fact admitted... I am sorry... and in fact had... was the person who could have precluded the story from being published.</text>
            <text syncTime="1744.045" offset="7121856">Additionally, he was the man who admitted specifically refusing to publish a retraction when a demand for such a retraction was made in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1755.321" offset="7166891">With respect to Mr. South, there is also, I think, a disparate view of the facts between the parties in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1762.631" offset="7196148">The trial court, contrary to the suggestion of Mr. Kester, and this is the trial court that ruled against the appellees in this case, stated,</text>
            <text syncTime="1774.532" offset="7243795">"In addition, Reporter South visited California at least once for purposes relating to the article. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1781.858" offset="7273052">Both the trial court and the court of appeals reached that same conclusion, that there was a pretrial visit by Mr. South to California with respect to this particular article, and as Mr. Kester has conceded, I don't view whether in fact there was such a visit or whether there were five telephone calls or 15, and I think we have a dispute in the record with respect to precisely how many investigative calls were made by Mr. South to California, the point being that the thrust of the investigation was aimed at California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.264" offset="7426652">We feel that the fact that Mr. South and Mr. Calder were employees has no bearing on the jurisdictional question in the facts, in the jurisdictionally relevant facts that are presented in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1837.929" offset="7497392">Were this the Keaton case, where it had been indicated had a great deal fewer jurisdictionally relevant contacts, possibly the employee status might have some additional significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1852.812" offset="7556847">In this matter, however, it is clear that both Mr. South and Mr. Calder were aware that the state of largest circulation of the Enquirer was California, in excess of or approximately 600,000 copies, and in fact that the Enquirer was a publication which proclaimed itself to be largest circulation of any paper in America, and in fact, as the record before this Court indicates, only 6 percent of the National Enquirer's publication was distributed in the state in which it was published, that is, in Florida.</text>
            <text syncTime="1887.097" offset="7694042">So, California was the largest state, and that was known to both Mr. South and Calder, and the facts here are even more compelling.</text>
            <text syncTime="1895.326" offset="7726956">The article dealt with a subject that were known to both Mr. South and Mr. Calder to be residents of California, in an industry that related to California, and clearly injury, if it were to occur, would be focused in California.</text>
            <text syncTime="1914.648" offset="7804279">Certainly in this case where you are dealing with celebrities of some national reputation, a claim for injury in many, if not all other states might be involved, but that is not before the Court because there was no forum shopping here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.033" offset="7861748">The lawsuit was basically filed in California, where the plaintiffs reside.</text>
            <text syncTime="1934.936" offset="7885363">With respect to the conduct of the defendants, it is clear that both Mr. South and Mr. Calder are joint tort feasors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.899" offset="7937294">As Mr. Kester has indicated, it is our belief that they could be subject to jurisdiction, and the sole question before this Court is whether or not the appellees who resided in California did nothing to bring this attack upon them in that state and nationally must now go to another jurisdiction, that is, Florida, to sue two of the primary participants in this publication.</text>
            <text syncTime="1974.732" offset="8044605">We think that the case of Worldwide Volkswagen in fact supports jurisdiction in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.650" offset="8080236">There was certainly no... the foreseeability of being sued in California was well known to both Mr. Calder and Mr. South, and in fact Mr. Calder had been sued in other celebrity litigation involving the National Enquirer in California and at that point did not even bother to object to personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.313" offset="8174904">The intent here on behalf of both Mr. Calder and Mr. South were clearly to inflict wilful and malicious injury to the plaintiff... I am sorry, to the appellee and her husband in the state of California, and we respectfully submit that the restatement, Section 36, restatement of conflicts, the effects doctrine, would certainly be applicable and justified in the context and facts of this case where you have wilful and knowing intentional conduct not only causing injury in California but aimed and intended to cause injury there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2057.792" offset="8376778">With respect to the difficulty of suit in California, we would submit that the added burden to Mr. South and Mr. Calder to be sued in California is certainly not as great as indicated by the appellants.</text>

            <text syncTime="2128.763" offset="8660677">In addition, in addition, we feel that the case of Church of Scientology versus Adams is extremely appropriate.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.383" offset="8715221">That is the Ninth Circuit's decision, which weighs and balances the minimum contacts and jurisdictional standard in the context of a libel case, and there the court indicated, and again, the court indicated that the contacts would basically turn upon the knowing foreseeability of the defamatory article causing injury in a particular state, namely, the state of California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2176.010" offset="8849699">It has also been referred by Mr. Kester that suing the individual defendants rather than the corporate entity allows them to have a certain detachment, and it is in fact that detachment that we feel is appropriate to eliminate, as has been suggested by the court, the--</text>

            <text syncTime="2195.206" offset="8926499">I thought he said... he was stating as a matter of fact that if your corporation which employs you is a party to the suit, but you are not, you have a certain detachment that you lose when you are named a defendant yourself.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.574" offset="8995985">I don't think he said that all personal... all persons ought to have a right to that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2216.698" offset="9012390">I understand, Your Honor, but I think that a malicious and intentional wrongdoer might not be entitled to that detachment, that in fact maybe it is the people at the Enquirer, for the Enquirer as a corporation could not itself do anything but for or through the people who work for it, that in fact those people not be permitted that detachment, that they in fact, their wrongful conduct be on the line, so to speak, that they be answerable for their conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2246.295" offset="9130777">It is in fact Mr. South and Mr. Calder and the other employees of the Enquirer who publish the articles which may and sometimes do lead to libel litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.806" offset="9172886">It seems that in terms of, again, considering the practicalities of the situation, that there is very little additional burden with respect to the individual defendants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.361" offset="9239132">They will likely be represented by the same counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2275.844" offset="9249059">It is very frequently the case in libel litigation that there are insurance companies involved in terms of providing counsel and at least a certain degree of... a certain degree of coverage, at least with respect to compensatory damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.853" offset="9317082">Turning to the First Amendment considerations, we feel that it is inappropriate to add an additional obfuscation to the already somewhat confusing and at least hard to articulate jurisdictional standards.</text>
            <text syncTime="2315.813" offset="9408928">The First Amendment is amply considered through these courts' prior precedents in New York Times versus Sullivan and its progeny, and the chill which this litigation might cast upon individual employees was also considered.</text>
            <text syncTime="2338.084" offset="9497954">It seems to me that the proper and primary focus of whether or not these employees should be subjected to any chill if any there be by virtue of being subjected to suit in California is determined by the substantive law of whether or not employees can in fact be sued for libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2363.263" offset="9598682">That law... we feel that that has been determined.</text>
            <text syncTime="2366.464" offset="9611534">The substantive law says they are responsible.</text>
            <text syncTime="2368.385" offset="9619162">Why should we now engraft upon standard jurisdictional analysis another burden for purposes of evading jurisdiction?</text>
            <text syncTime="2382.177" offset="9674332">Going back for a moment to the authority stated in the restatement, Section 37, the effects test, we feel that the effects test clearly is being applied if this Court is going to apply it in this case to Mr. Calder, who we have acknowledged had no direct contacts in terms of telephone calls, visits, or anything else with California.</text>
            <text syncTime="2414.679" offset="9804318">If this Court will apply that principle to him, we feel it is the clearest application of that principle, for of the various situations to which the effects principle could be directed, that is the one which... that is the one which basically has the strongest support with respect to this Court's prior precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="2440.591" offset="9907972">There can be no unfairness in subjecting someone to jurisdiction who has intentionally directed his wrongful conduct at a particular state.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.554" offset="9959903">With respect to the fiduciary shield doctrine, so to speak, the appellants here are asking this Court to in fact enshrine that principle, a principle which insulates employees from jurisdiction because they are employees and because acts which they have committed in the course of their employment may in fact... excuse me.</text>
            <text syncTime="2479.576" offset="10063975">Acts which they have accomplished in the course of their employment somehow don't count in terms of having any jurisdictional significance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.272" offset="10118728">Mr. Ablon, on the effects test which you ask us to apply, do you think that there would be jurisdiction over a writer who never entered California at all and made no telephone calls at all based on simply the foreseeability that the article might be published there?</text>

            <text syncTime="2551.639" offset="10352158">I might also add that that response is given considering the facts of this case where the article is aimed at the particular jurisdiction in terms of the subject matter of the article, the residence of the plaintiffs of the article, the knowledge of the extent and breadth of the circulation of that article within the jurisdiction.</text>

            <text syncTime="2722.617" offset="11036148">That is, the law would be that if in fact Mr. South or Mr. Calder engaged in wrongful conduct not authorized by the Enquirer, it is conceivable that agency principle might not apply, but certainly then the intentional wilful wrongdoing of those individuals would equally subject them to substantive liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="2739.906" offset="11105320">I would also pose to the Court the problem of in effect utilizing different jurisdictional standards, and that is really what is advocated here by the appellants.</text>
            <text syncTime="2760.071" offset="11185882">They are advocating a different jurisdictional standard for the media because of First Amendment considerations.</text>
            <text syncTime="2768.910" offset="11221304">They are advocating a different jurisdictional standard for employees of corporations rather than the corporations themselves.</text>
            <text syncTime="2778.656" offset="11260279">We feel that the standard jurisdictional analysis should be applied, and when that application is made in the facts of this... in this case, jurisdiction over both Mr. Calder and Mr. South is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="2791.854" offset="11313046">The cases for which... which are cited in support of the due process restriction on subjecting employees to jurisdiction for acts they committed in the course of their corporate employment we feel are largely inapposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2822.123" offset="11434150">They generally deal with the situation where there is an effort to impute jurisdiction by the corporation... I am sorry, impute jurisdiction from the corporation to the employee where the employee cannot be shown to have in fact had the contact himself, even if it was as an agent of the corporation with the jurisdiction, and under those circumstances, we have no problem with at least suggesting that in fact there may be a more serious due process problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2853.876" offset="11561105">Where, however, the jurisdiction is premised upon the acts of the individual, as is presented in the facts of this case, then it seems clear that those acts should be counted for purposes of jurisdiction over that individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2875.757" offset="11648667">If that individual is not responsible or liable for whatever the wrongdoing might be, then the substantive law is sufficiently adequate to ensure that they will not be subjected to any substantive liability.</text>

            <text syncTime="3408.886" offset="13781199">Certainly this case applies, as Mr. Justice White mentioned a while ago, to an author.</text>
            <text syncTime="3413.744" offset="13800635">The decision here would apply to authors who get sued, and I take it Mr. Ablon is saying, well, it doesn't apply to authors who don't get sued, but every author who gets sued is going to be facing a complaint that says he acted maliciously, wilfully, with the intent to harm people, and so on.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.238" offset="13866568">If effect is carried to that extreme, then all the limits on jurisdiction for individuals in libel cases are essentially eradicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.577" offset="13907946">I would mention that this Court from at least the time of International Shoe has also recognized that individuals are not the same thing as corporations when you are dealing with the question of personal jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3456.867" offset="13973147">When you have got a corporation, you are immediately faced with the question, where is it, because nobody can see a corporation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3463.833" offset="14000941">It is an incorporeal presence.</text>
            <text syncTime="3465.286" offset="14006793">It is a jurisdictional construct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3467.286" offset="14014839">An individual, you generally know where he is, what he is doing, and the individual has some rights under the Constitution that corporations don't always enjoy.</text>

            <text syncTime="3499.585" offset="14143988">We have to look, as the Court said in Hanson against Denckla, at the contacts of each defendant individually and say what were his contacts in the case, and in this case these individuals did not have those contacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="3515.017" offset="14205741">It is not necessary to decide this case even to reach the First Amendment, because this is not a close case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3521.685" offset="14232386">This case can be decided under the standard jurisdictional principles of the Fourteenth Amendment as they have always been applied, and what we have here are individuals.</text>
