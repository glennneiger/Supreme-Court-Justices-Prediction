            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="141381">We'll hear arguments next in United Building and Construction Trades Council against Mayor and Council of Camden.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.199" offset="186103">Mr. Kudatzky, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="steven_k_kudatzky" startTime="57.260" stopTime="311.376">
            <label>Mr. Steven K. Kudatzky</label>
            <text syncTime="57.260" offset="370318">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="60.883" offset="384842">We are here today to ask this Court of nip in the bud a trend which we believe is pernicious to our national unity, that trend being an attempt by the City of Camden, among other cities, to solve in a blunderbuss fashion the problem of its resident unemployment at the expense of non-residents who seek the opportunity to ply their trade, pursue their common calling, whatever the Court cares to describe it as, in the City of Camden without being discriminated against simply because they are non-residents in the State of New Jersey and the City of Camden.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.623" offset="567804">It is our view that the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the United States Constitution applies to protect non-residents against this sort of discrimination and that under the applicable tests set forth by this Court for privileges and immunities issues, set forth specifically in the Hicklin v. Orbeck case, that the invalidation of the Camden ordinance should follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="134.572" offset="679608">This case is before the Court on direct appeal from the ruling of the Supreme Court of New Jersey upholding the action of the administrative agency, the Department of the Treasury for the State of New Jersey, which approved and thereby gave life to the Camden Resident Preference Ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.856" offset="772708">The Supreme Court of New Jersey held essentially that the Privileges and Immunities Clause did not vie in this case either because the enactment was a municipal enactment or, more accurately in my view, because the discrimination on the basis of municipal residence is not a right protected by the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.942" offset="873123">We believe the fact that this was enacted by the City of Camden as opposed to be being enacted by the State of New Jersey to be insignificant and that the real question is does discrimination on the basis of municipal residence call into play the protection of the Privileges and Immunities Clause?</text>
            <text syncTime="202.456" offset="951177">Supreme Court of New Jersey, in our view, erred factually and legally in reaching that conclusion.</text>
            <text syncTime="209.970" offset="981165">The Court felt that the impact of this ordinance would be greater with respect to New Jersians who are non-residents of Camden than with respect to non-residents of the State of New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.201" offset="1038112">We have sought to demonstrate through census data that we have included in our reply brief that within the standard metropolitan statistical area of Philadelphia, which includes the City of Camden, certain other counties in the State of New Jersey, and certain counties outside of the City of Philadelphia in the State of Pennsylvania, that there would be more non-residents who are likely to be affected by this ordinance than New Jersey residents who are non-residents of Camden.</text>
            <text syncTime="253.229" offset="1154201">We do not believe that the fact that other New Jersians are adversely impacted by this ordinance either renders the privileges and immunities protection inapplicable or somehow serves to cure the harm done to the non-residents by putting them on an equal footing somehow with the New Jersians.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.912" offset="1248973">We believe that in assessing whether non-residents of New Jersey are treated the same as resident of New Jersey, that all residents of New Jersey must be factored into the equation including the favored class here, residents of the City of Camden.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.024" offset="1313443">Some New Jersey residents are clearly treated better than residents of Pennsylvania and for that reason we believe the fact that the discrimination is on the basis of municipal residence does not render the privileges and immunities protection inapplicable.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="311.376" offset="1386795">But the discrimination is not limited to non-residents, is it?</text>

            <text syncTime="317.992" offset="1413335">Clearly persons who are not residents of the City of Camden are victimized to the same extent.</text>

            <text syncTime="327.365" offset="1450743">Slightly more than a year ago this Court heard argument in the case of White versus Mayor and Council of the City of Boston, the case whose facts are replicated to some extent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="342.896" offset="1512914">However, we believe that the ruling in White does not foreordain the rejection of our arguments here, basically for the reason that we are dealing in this case with an issue reserved for decision in White; namely the extent to which the Privileges and Immunities Clause might afford greater protection than the Commerce Clause which was at issue in White.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.472" offset="1603193">We believe that the Privileges and Immunities Clause, being as it is a constitutional guarantee of equality of treatment to non-residents that it is personal to the individuals involved, is not something that Congress can waive or authorize a violation of by state.</text>
            <text syncTime="389.167" offset="1697965">We do have UDAG money involved in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.160" offset="1713952">One of the two projects to which the ordinance is presently being applied has in part UDAG money funding it as was the case in the Boston situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="404.325" offset="1758674">We also have here, however, money from the Department of Transportation funding the other large project presently being subjected to the ordinance, a transportation center for--</text>

            <text syncTime="514.139" offset="2197845">Even assuming that the could do so in-house, as you are positing, I don't believe that would answer the question in this case because these people are clearly private employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="525.956" offset="2245179">It cannot be seriously argued in my view that these employees would enjoy or not enjoy rather the protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act as would be the case with in-house employees of the city if they were doing the construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="542.907" offset="2312992">They are different.</text>

            <text syncTime="560.779" offset="2384463">It is not this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="562.591" offset="2391673">The city is seeking to go far beyond influencing direct distributions of its own resources by trying to regulate private employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.856" offset="2432738">And, we believe that is a distinction of constitutional dimension that we believe sets this case apart from Boston and really undercuts the analogy in the White case of these employees being city employees in an informal sense as Justice Rehnquist stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="590.878" offset="2504836">We believe that the right being asserted here is a right which has traditionally been held to be within the protection of the Privileges and Immunities Clause as interpreted by this Court and that in light of that fact it is the burden of the city to come forward with a showing that the non-residents here are a peculiar source of the evil that the city is trying to deal with in its ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="624.041" offset="2637538">That evil, we think, is a broader one than the city's characterization of it in its brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="630.926" offset="2665019">It is simply a problem of high unemployment among the residents of Camden.</text>
            <text syncTime="635.238" offset="2682259">It is not necessarily low employment of Camden residents on Camden public works projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.643" offset="2707859">I think for the same reasons that Hicklin v. Orbeck invalidated that rationale as a savings rationale, it should be invalidated here.</text>
            <text syncTime="652.277" offset="2750387">There is just simply no showing that whatever the causes of the unemployment problems in Camden are that they are fairly traceable to the activities of non-residents.</text>

            <text syncTime="675.145" offset="2841920">I don't just mean geographically, but didn't they try to regulate virtually all private employment in the state?</text>

            <text syncTime="680.718" offset="2864176">It was unfortunate that the Hicklin court did not really address the propriety of the... if I can call it the first-tier regulation... the regulation of the employees who were working directly on the pipeline as opposed to those further down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="696.677" offset="2928019">Clearly the Alaska higher statute had what was termed the ripple effect all the way down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="703.522" offset="2955396">The City of Camden here is limiting its ordinance in a very precise way to persons who are going to be employed by contractors with whom the city deals or subcontractors of those contractors on projects, either funded directly by the city or through grants administered by the city, which need not and are not, to my understanding, limited to public works projects.</text>
            <text syncTime="731.361" offset="3066782">In fact, to our understanding, with the nursing home project presently half way done, I would say, if I can tell by looking at it yesterday, is a privately-owned project or at least not a city-owned project.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.320" offset="3122579">We further believe that the city has attempted really to use a shotgun approach to a problem that requires a surgically precise remedy.</text>
            <text syncTime="764.511" offset="3199379">There has been no attempt to limit the benefits of the ordinance to unemployed persons, to persons of a certain economic level, or to persons who are qualified to work in the construction trades.</text>
            <text syncTime="780.082" offset="3261655">We also do not believe that the city has asserted justification that this also promotes minority hiring is enough to say the ordinance--</text>

            <text syncTime="1289.117" offset="5297848">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1292.208" offset="5310178">The City of Camden here, of course, takes quite a different position than Appellants in this matter and asks that this Court, if it would, to dismiss the appeal and, in the alternative, to affirm the decision of the New Jersey Supreme Court based on what we think are three very critical and important premises.</text>
            <text syncTime="1311.421" offset="5386978">First, that this case before the Court is not ripe for decision because Appellants have established no case of controversy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1318.615" offset="5415817">Secondly, because the Camden ordinance provides a basis for good or best-faith effort to provide hiring preference for 40 percent of those persons employed on construction projects for Camden residents does not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause and, of course, the equal protection question raised by the Duration Residency Clause has been mooted by amendment and revision of our ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1345.422" offset="5523023">We noted, Your Honors, with a great deal of interest, that the Appellants here have not established any injury either to themselves or any member of their unions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1357.621" offset="5571820">There is no record of any injury, there is no record of any person being denied a job, there is no record of any individual outside the State of New Jersey being denied employment because of the ordinance here that the City of Camden has established.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.622" offset="5635768">There are no concrete facts for this Court to determine whether, in fact, if not an actual privileges and immunities issues has been raised by the Appellant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1383.717" offset="5676205">We have no factual backdrop to determine how many persons, if any persons, have been injured by this ordinance passed by the City of Camden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1391.854" offset="5708702">We think that one of the reasons why there has been no factual backdrop or no clear definition of a concise injury or concrete establishment of a fact of injury is because Appellants here clearly misapply and misunderstand, in our opinion, the Privileges and Immunities Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1414.438" offset="5799085">The Privileges and Immunities Clause itself is a clause historically which is established to develop national unity, a national republic, out of a number of independent sovereign states at the beginning of this country's history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1432.090" offset="5869721">The purpose of it was to form a comity of interests among the states, among the citizens of those states, assuring to the citizens of each state the same fundamental rights and privileges of citizens of other states.</text>

            <text syncTime="1789.684" offset="7300081">In other words, it was never heard by the Appellate Division, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="1793.166" offset="7313979">It went directly to the New Jersey Supreme Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1795.197" offset="7322129">One of the points we try to make on this case is that no one is... No state citizens of New Jersey is advantaged or given an advantage because of state citizenship and no out-of-state citizen is denied an advantage because of out-of-state residency in this particular ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1814.959" offset="7401123">There is no benefit to being a New Jersey resident just as there is no disadvantage to being an out-of-state resident.</text>
            <text syncTime="1821.423" offset="7427037">Therefore, we do not feel that this matter falls under ambit of the Privileges and Immunities Clause as traditionally has been argued.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.109" offset="7461727">We feel that in terms of the Hicklin case, which was argued by the Appellants, that there is a different case altogether.</text>
            <text syncTime="1839.185" offset="7498090">There are similarities however, we feel that the Hicklin case goes much further than the Camden ordinance in terms of its ripple effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1848.001" offset="7533303">If we look at the Hicklin case, we can see where the advantages of the Alaskan hire law even went to suppliers of subcontractors and it was very difficult, as this Court has stated for the Court to even determine how remote or how the attenuating factors involved in this case affected or achieved the goals that were to be affected by this hire law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1875.971" offset="7645211">Our particular ordinance is specific, it is to the point, and applies only to persons working on public works projects for the City of Camden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1886.740" offset="7688261">Another point that I think is important in terms of privileges and immunities argument is that no person is denied any fundamental right here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1900.328" offset="7742596">There is no fundamental right to work on a construction project for the City of Camden.</text>
            <text syncTime="1906.471" offset="7767255">And, when we weigh that particular factor with the interest the city has or the state has in developing its urban infrastructure or the development of those citizens within our city, we feel that weighing the fundamental right alleged here and the interest of the state far outweigh the particular argument being made by counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1928.127" offset="7853877">What we also want to impress upon this Court, that the City of Camden, like so many other cities in the northeastern part of our country and throughout this country, as they become older, find that one of the remaining resources available to those cities is the rehabilitation, revitalization, remodernization of the city's infrastructure.</text>
            <text syncTime="1950.280" offset="7942485">We feel that the development of a city for those persons who continue to live there, for those new industries or services who wish to move there, redevelopment of highways, facilities such a bridges, sewers, whatever, is a new resource and new industry facing our cities, the redevelopment of our transportation systems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1969.744" offset="8020330">And, we feel that the City of Camden, as well as the State of New Jersey, has an interest in seeing to it that its citizens benefit directly from the need to rehabilitate and revitalize the infrastructure of our cities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1983.622" offset="8075814">The important factor here again is that the City of Camden is not here attempting to develop some sort of obstructionist goal or doctrine of trying to keep people out.</text>
            <text syncTime="1998.432" offset="8135059">In fact, we welcome people to come into the City of Camden.</text>
            <text syncTime="2000.933" offset="8145090">What we are attempting to do here is to pass affirmative social legislation to benefit the citizens of our city and we do not in any way violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause in doing so.</text>

            <text syncTime="2054.219" offset="8358250">I think the point is very interesting here about unions' posture in this entire case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2061.294" offset="8386462">We see several things here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2064.185" offset="8398060">Number one, the unions obviously must have some people who belong to it who benefit from our ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.831" offset="8432646">Keep in mind that our ordinance says make a best-faith effort to hire 40 percent residents in terms of manpower.</text>
            <text syncTime="2080.756" offset="8464307">Obviously, it would seem to me, that a union that would come into Camden or a construction company that would come into Camden to work would normally, ordinarily hire persons who worked in the City of Camden.</text>

            <text syncTime="2354.543" offset="9559464">I would like to say this case is not here, but I am not clear, Your Honor, if the case would fail for that reason.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.098" offset="9585691">I think one of the things that was very important in the Hicklin case, and even in the case of Toomer against Witsell, was that those cases indicated that the Privileges and Immunities Clause is not an absolute; that there can be distinction made between citizens and non-citizens and one of the factors was whether or not a state had a possessory interest in any of the factors concerned such as its own resources, money, or whatever.</text>
            <text syncTime="2389.598" offset="9699690">There is another factor that I would like to argue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="2392.170" offset="9710034">There has been some discussion about the White case, White against Massachusetts Council of Construction Employers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2399.934" offset="9741068">That case, of course, was founded on the Commerce Clause, found that that case did not violate the Commerce Clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="2407.589" offset="9771683">I think it is important for us to point out that we feel that the Commerce Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause are mutually reinforcing doctrines, each attempting in its own way to establish a certain sense of national unity; one vis a vis the flow of commerce, the other through the flow of persons and privileges and fundamental rights of citizens through the states.</text>
            <text syncTime="2431.804" offset="9868545">We feel that there are times, for instance, when a state does get involved in commerce, as long as it is acting as a market participant rather than a market regulator, that it may get involved in commerce and somehow involve itself in the flow of commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="2453.149" offset="9953913">As long as the state is using its own money and it may distinguish and favor citizens of that state which was certainly the case in this Court's opinion in Hughes v. Alexandria Scrap, Reeves and Stake.</text>
            <text syncTime="2468.569" offset="10015562">I think the same thing can be said true about the Privileges and Immunities Clause, that there are times when the state... when it can in the protection of certain vital state interests find that it can and should favor or distinguish or make distinction between its own citizens and other citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="2491.134" offset="10105841">I don't feel that when those vital interests are... When those particular factors are prevalent that there is a violation of the privileges and immunities of any particular individual.</text>
            <text syncTime="2501.860" offset="10148787">We also find it interesting that here a Council of Trade Unions, who probably feel that a clause in a contract that says buy American is patriotic, but on the other hand, a clause in a contract that says hire local is unconstitutional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2524.126" offset="10237812">We do not feel that the statute here or the ordinance of the City of Camden, which attempts to ameliorate certain local evils, addresses specifically those evils, and simply requests of those contractors who do business with it to try to hire our own.</text>
            <text syncTime="2545.820" offset="10324643">In the Appellant's brief, they speak in strong terms of our ordinance being exclusionary, denying access to out-of-state persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="2559.880" offset="10380859">The concern that we have here is that that is not true and if one reads that ordinance carefully you can see that it excludes no one and denies no one access and impinges upon no one's constitutional right.</text>
            <text syncTime="2574.719" offset="10440209">It is merely an effort by the City of Camden to address a very grave social issue by passing what it thinks is an affirmative, positive, social legislation to cure a local ill.</text>
            <text syncTime="2588.908" offset="10496947">And, we feel that we should pass reference the Privileges and Immunities Clause because we do not feel as though it reaches that level.</text>

            <text syncTime="2975.026" offset="12041410">We started this case as early as we could.</text>
            <text syncTime="2979.861" offset="12060741">We didn't want to wait and file a 1983 action after people had actually lost jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="2985.344" offset="12082684">The ordinance came into effect upon its approval by the state affirmative action officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2992.137" offset="12109851">Under New Jersey law, the exclusive method of reviewing state administrative agency action is by appeal to the Appellate Division.</text>
            <text syncTime="2999.153" offset="12137959">At that point, once the ordinance came into play, non-residents, out-of-state residents, seeking to work on construction projects were the victims of a diminution in their job market, that diminution being 40 percent of the component of that job market represented by City of Camden public works projects, which is not an insubstantial amount.</text>
            <text syncTime="3027.022" offset="12249450">While I cannot name an individual who has suffered the loss of a job at this point, it seems undeniable to me that some day someone is going to actually lose a job, but presently people are having a diminution.</text>

            <text syncTime="3060.361" offset="12382779">I will agree that no specific individual has done that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.794" offset="12396467">We do assert, nevertheless, the standing does exist because these persons are likely to suffer the detriment.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.240" offset="12430321">That detriment is traceable to the ordinance and, in fact, they are presently suffering a detriment in the reduction of their employability represented by the resident preference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3082.317" offset="12470550">I would again note that we are representing or asserting rather the rights of out-of-state employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="3089.931" offset="12501061">We are not here defending the contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3092.642" offset="12511928">It is irrelevant in my view what penalties or non-penalties might exist for contractors.</text>
            <text syncTime="3098.396" offset="12534916">In this case, even if one out-of-state resident loses a job or an employment opportunity, I think that is sufficient to confer standing and to create a privileges and immunities controversy cognizable by this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3115.239" offset="12602312">With respect to the point that we are asserting a right to work on Camden public works projects, I disagree that the right being asserted is so specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="3126.876" offset="12648810">In Hicklin v. Orbeck people could have work on non-oil and gas related jobs in Alaska, yet the fact that those jobs were denied them was deemed sufficient to trigger the applicability of the clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3140.163" offset="12701995">In Toomer, the shrimp people could have gone and fished for something besides shrimp or fished beyond the three-mile limit, yet that constriction of their employability was sufficient.</text>
            <text syncTime="3154.075" offset="12757583">We see a trend already under way in New Jersey where two other jurisdictions have enacted protectionist preference ordinances perhaps as a result of the New Jersey Supreme Court's ruling here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3172.084" offset="12829681">I think the Privileges and Immunities Clause would be gutted, literally gutted if it is not applicable to municipal residents' discrimination.</text>
            <text syncTime="3182.242" offset="12870328">It would be no different than allowing the state to accomplish via the backdoor what it cannot accomplish directly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3188.657" offset="12895928">In State of New Jersey versus City of Philadelphia, New Jersey could vend Philadelphia's trash on a county-by-county or municipality-by-municipality basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="3198.793" offset="12936470">If it could do that, but couldn't do it directly, this Court's ruling would have been eviscerated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.837" offset="12964682">We see a day coming when people will only be able to work where they live.</text>
            <text syncTime="3212.202" offset="12990178">Philadelphia surely has cause now to enact a retaliatory resident preference ordinance and a number of Camden residents would be penalized by that certainly.</text>
            <text syncTime="3225.599" offset="13043677">Other municipalities in New Jersey have reason to do that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3230.885" offset="13064888">1984 is coming.</text>
            <text syncTime="3233.366" offset="13074814">We would not like to see this Court encourage in any way a system which could lead ultimately to an internal passport system where people--</text>

            <text syncTime="3265.817" offset="13204591">That, nevertheless, in the building and construction trades these days is virtually the entire field.</text>
            <text syncTime="3273.402" offset="13234893">There is little... Certainly in Camden, there is little going on that is not public-works related in the broadest sense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.446" offset="13267076">With respect to the divided loyalty question, clearly some members of our unions are Camden residents and are being benefited, however, they, I believe, would rather see this type of protectionism struck down because they know that they are going to be the victims when it is Philadelphia or another Camden suburb that enacts the ordinance.</text>
            <text syncTime="3307.274" offset="13370416">There is no reason to think this is going to stop at Camden's door.</text>
            <text syncTime="3312.677" offset="13392045">There are 521 municipalities in New Jersey.</text>
            <text syncTime="3315.329" offset="13402599">All of them could do the same thing and certainly a vast number more throughout the country.</text>
            <text syncTime="3322.405" offset="13430916">The goal of revitalization cited by the city simply is not well served by pitting Camden against its neighbors, particularly its out-of-state neighbors in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3336.032" offset="13485459">We believe the Privileges and Immunities Clause applies here and limits the rights of the city in preferring its own residents or trying to ensure to them the benefits of some of its expenditures when they try to do it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3353.975" offset="13557244">Regulation of private employment is simply beyond any concept validated by this Court of state or municipal sovereignty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3364.251" offset="13598308">There are differences.</text>
            <text syncTime="3366.594" offset="13607712">They are doing it in a constitutionally impermissible fashion in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3370.925" offset="13625058">It is not to say that they cannot do it in some other fashion and accomplish substantially a similar result.</text>
