            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="152693">We'll hear arguments next in Michigan against Clifford.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.360" offset="198042">Mrs. Bartee, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <label>Ms. Janice M. Joyce Bartee</label>
            <text syncTime="15.321" offset="213924">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="17.802" offset="223851">Fifteen years ago this Court decided the landmark case of Terry versus Ohio.</text>
            <text syncTime="23.016" offset="244749">It looked to the language of the Fourth Amendment to articulate a promise previously unrecognized; that is although all seizures of persons, while within the Fourth Amendment, not every seizure requires probable cause to arrest to be reasonable under the first clause of the Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.139" offset="317160">Today we ask this Court to again focus its attention upon the language of the Fourth Amendment and recognize that it contains two separate, distinct, and coequal clauses, the reasonableness clause and the warrant clause, and to hold that administrative inspection oriented searches fall without the warrant and within the reasonableness clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="64.663" offset="411305">More specifically, with regard to this case, we are urging this Court to hold if there is a fire and firefighters must enter the premises to distinguish the fire, fire investigators may also enter the premises within reasonable time after the flames have been extinguished to conduct an investigation of reasonable scope and intensity to determine the cause and origin of the fire.</text>
            <text syncTime="92.041" offset="520811">We contend this initial uncontested, unwarranted investigative intrusion, with or without probably cause, is justified by the mere fact that a fire has occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="106.359" offset="578071">The bare language of the Fourth Amendment requires only that searches and seizures be reasonable and that if and when a warrant shall issue it must be based upon probable cause to believe sizeable items will be found in the premises, supported by a sworn affidavit and particularly describing the place to be searched and the items to be seized.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.417" offset="670335">Two views have emerged from this Court regarding the Fourth Amendment requirements.</text>
            <text syncTime="135.050" offset="692801">The prevailing view to date holds that a search warrant is always required except when the facts and circumstances fit within a few carefully defined exceptions.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.934" offset="732402">This view focuses upon whether the failure to obtain a warrant is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.018" offset="756749">The second view recognizes that this Court, starting with Camara, has forced administrative searches unnaturally into the warrant clause and that this causes serious problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.858" offset="808053">In applying the warrant preference indiscriminately to all searches, rather than simply applying them to the seizure-oriented searches as intended, this Court has been forced to distort the concept of probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.009" offset="868657">It is our contention, as is maintained by the second view, that the Fourth Amendment guarantees searches will not be unreasonable and that neither the absence of a warrant nor the practicability of not obtaining a warrant is dispositive of whether the Fourth Amendment has been violated.</text>

            <text syncTime="198.560" offset="946920">Mrs. Bartee, I suppose you could also prevail if the Court were to say that the facts of this case fitted within the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement, could you not?</text>

            <text syncTime="211.750" offset="999687">The precise holding by this Court in Michigan v. Tyler dealt with a subsequent entry which was made after initial entry was made while the flames were smoldering.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.859" offset="1052037">The precise issue before this Court now deals with an initial entry which was made six hours after the flames had been distinguished.</text>

            <text syncTime="247.784" offset="1143779">In that connection, I would like to know whether, in the jurisdiction in question, the arson squad would have visited the Cliffords' home even without a report that the fire was of suspicious origin.</text>

If there is a major explosion or a homicide on the scene, they leave wherever they are... If they are in the middle of an investigation, they leave and go to that site.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.068" offset="1420886">And, in this case... This case was determined to be a priority case because a police officer was involved and they always investigate a police officer's house if they possibly can.</text>

            <text syncTime="1186.438" offset="4898411">For example, an administrative search might be justified by a legislative scheme which authorizes periodic inspections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1196.804" offset="4939893">The fourth question then is, once the quantum of information is met and once the search is deemed permissible, the fourth question would be what safeguards does the reasonableness clause require in order to insure that the execution of this search is reasonable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1212.054" offset="5000811">Once again, in the administrative arena, the reasonableness clause might require prior notice and no inconvenient time of execution.</text>
            <text syncTime="1221.330" offset="5038009">Now, if, on the other hand, the answer to the second question is that the search is... the sole purpose of the search is to seize items, then the answer to the third question, as to the quantum of information, is always probable cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1239.601" offset="5111047">And, the fourth question would still apply in that the search must be executed in a reasonable manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1870.994" offset="7636566">I believe that reasonable time, to follow up your answer... The starting point for reasonable time would be that time within which the fire may rekindle, but it could not end within time within which a fire may rekindle because there may also be factors beyond the control of the investigators which precludes or hinders their initial investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.718" offset="7719531">For example, in Tyler the steam and darkness hindered the investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.390" offset="7738234">It may be unsafe to make that initial investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.901" offset="7748265">A bulldozer may be required to remove some debris to make that initial investigation or, as in the instant case, water may have to be pumped out of the basement to make that initial investigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.910" offset="7796331">So, reasonable time would require several factors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1913.141" offset="7805212">Some of these factors were discussed by this Court in Tyler such as the attempt to secure the premises, the continued use of the premises.</text>

            <text syncTime="1930.574" offset="7874907">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1941.119" offset="7917121">As the Court is well aware petitioner in this case is, in effect, asking this Court to overrule Camara versus Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco, a 1967 case, dealing with warrantless searches of the physical condition of premises by building inspectors; asking the Court to overrule See versus City of Seattle, a fire inspection case, 1967; asking the Court to overrule Marshall v. Barlows, Inc., a warrantless search under the occupational heath and safety provisions; and they are asking the Court to overrule Michigan v. Tyler.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.410" offset="8098306">The reason that petitioner perceives it necessary to ask this Court to overrule those cases is because whether this search is viewed in the context of an administrative search or whether it is viewed in the context of a criminal search, it is clear a warrant was required under any case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2008.305" offset="8185869">I submit to this Court that the Court need not reach the question of whether these cases should be overruled.</text>
            <text syncTime="2017.452" offset="8222440">And, the reason it need not reach those questions is because clearly a police officer has no right to enter a private home, which this Court through the years has protected and drawn the line that the threshold of the home which the police officers or not officials may enter, absent compelling cause, exigent circumstances for a warrant.</text>

            <text syncTime="2101.565" offset="8558897">Thereafter, when the firefighters had left the scene of those premises, the Cliffords had their insurance agent boarding those premises up.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.232" offset="8597558">The purpose of the Fourth Amendment is so a police officer will not enter someone's private bedroom, go through that person's closets, go through the drawers of their dresser drawers to see if there is any evidence in there that they can convict them of a crime.</text>

            <text syncTime="2149.467" offset="8750531">Mr. Chief Justice, I think that I can fairly concede that that is within plain view.</text>
            <text syncTime="2154.472" offset="8770489">And, in fact, in this case we have a plain view situation and the plain view is because the origin of the fire here was very easily determined as being in the basement... There was an odor of flammable liquid, there was a definite burn pattern emerging from the stairwell of the basement stairwell and there was a can of Coleman fuel found in that basement next to the point of origin.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.736" offset="8867560">The firefighters found that can of fuel and they took that can of fuel and seized it because it was in plain view and they put it outside and then they gave a report to the arson squad of probable arson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2191.435" offset="8918342">This fire is probable arson, started in the basement.</text>
            <text syncTime="2195.259" offset="8933702">Now, at that point, it is our contention that it turned into a criminal investigation and if it was not criminal at that point it was certainly criminal by the time Lieutenant Beyer, who, by the way, I would like the Court to know is a police officer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2213.239" offset="9005591">Lieutenant Beyer is a member of the Detroit Police/Fire Arson Squard.</text>

In People v. Tyler, the Michigan Supreme Court set forth a clear rule for arson investigators to follow.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.075" offset="11424948">The Michigan Supreme Court said when the fire has been extinguished, there is no danger of its recurrence, and you have left the scene, your duties are over.</text>
            <text syncTime="2827.893" offset="11464236">If you want to go back in to determine cause and origin, get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.527" offset="11482731">This Court said in Tyler, well, that took an unrealistic and narrow view of the firefighting function.</text>
            <text syncTime="2840.080" offset="11512928">The Court viewed the re-entry by Chief See four hours later as a continuation of the original entry.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.586" offset="11550962">And, Justice White, I think you said in Tyler, in your concurring opinion, that that line of demarcation, the continuation, will not aid firefighters, it will confuse them.</text>
            <text syncTime="2861.384" offset="11598192">In other words, you predicted that there are going to be situations, because of this continuation theory, where firefighters or arson investigators could have easily have gotten a warrant and they are not going to do so because of this continuation theory in Michigan v. Tyler.</text>
            <text syncTime="2882.068" offset="11680948">I submit to the Court that if you create an exception to the warrant requirement, and I think the Court has in effect created an exception in Michigan v. Tyler called the continuation exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2895.867" offset="11736118">The exception will be expanded.</text>
            <text syncTime="2898.799" offset="11747821">The police and the firefighters will take it to the limits.</text>
