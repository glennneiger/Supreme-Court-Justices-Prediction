            <text syncTime="68.796" offset="412125">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="73.019" offset="429052">This is an exigent circumstances case.</text>
            <text syncTime="76.402" offset="442531">On that proposition I think there is agreement between the State and the Defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="81.986" offset="464892">The issue in this case is whether an exigent circumstances doctrine will justify the arrest of the Defendant in his home.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.934" offset="512644">The Wisconsin Supreme Court calling Fourth Amendment standards upheld the right of police without a warrant and without establishing consent to enter a home at night to arrest the householder for a traffic offense that was not committed in the officer's presence.</text>

            <text syncTime="118.327" offset="610237">About what time was it?</text>

          <turn speaker="gordon_b_baldwin" startTime="119.619" stopTime="201.533">
            <label>Mr. Gordon B. Baldwin</label>
            <text syncTime="119.619" offset="615462">The officer reportedly heard the call at 8:49 p.m. There was some dispute as to how long it took the officer to get to the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.284" offset="646077">I think it is generally agreed it is about 9:00.</text>
            <text syncTime="129.307" offset="654227">That was about a week before we would have gone on to daylight savings time so it was dark.</text>
            <text syncTime="138.303" offset="690172">The Wisconsin Supreme Court justified the traffic arrest applying its traffic arrest statute, and it held that exigent circumstances justified the arrest.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.852" offset="748373">It did so for three reasons: first, that the arrest was justified by a hot pursuit doctrine; secondly, that the Defendant who as I said was arrested in his home in his bedroom constituted a possible threat to public safety; and third, that the arrest was necessary in order to secure evidence of possible intoxication.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.347" offset="846384">Now on the facts we do not know exactly what the arresting officer knew.</text>
            <text syncTime="184.812" offset="876164">The arresting officer relied on an eye witness who saw a car driven erratically, crossed in front of oncoming traffic and stopped or got stuck in an open field or cemetery.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="201.533" offset="943037">When you said at the outset that this was truly an exigent circumstances case, did you mean that the exigent circumstance is the need of the officers to apprehend this gentleman while he might still be subject to a breathalyzer test or observation?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Gordon B. Baldwin</label>
            <text syncTime="219.635" offset="1015449">The officers justified, Mr. Chief Justice, the entry into the home as required by the need to obtain a blood-alcohol test, Officer Daley said, within two hours of the event to be proved.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="236.885" stopTime="238.668">

            <label>Mr. Gordon B. Baldwin</label>
            <text syncTime="238.668" offset="1091622">This was to preserve... As Officer Daley said, yes, to preserve evidence of intoxication he felt he had to enter the home under those circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.505" offset="1134985">The officer had been called by a passing motorist and spoke to the eye witness.</text>
            <text syncTime="255.769" offset="1160063">We do not know exactly what the eye witness said, but there is a discrepancy between what the eye witness testified on the stand where he said he thought that the errant driver was either drunk or sick and what the officer said he said.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.492" offset="1226936">The officer said he received the opinion that the errant driver was definitely intoxicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="279.675" offset="1255671">There was a difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.796" offset="1260164">My point is that we would know what the arresting officer knew or thought if we had a warrant applied for during the course of that next hour or so.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.076" offset="1321290">The officer did trace the automobile to the Defendant's home which was about half a mile away, went quickly to the home, knocked on the door.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.653" offset="1363609">That is clear.</text>
            <text syncTime="307.714" offset="1367788">What happened at the door is in dispute because the sixteen-year-old step-daughter who answered the knock was not available to testify to when this hearing occurred about two years later.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.483" offset="1426930">The officer went upstairs to the bedroom where he encountered Edward Welsh--</text>

            <text syncTime="338.596" offset="1491295">Its rationale was that the witnesses who are relevant to the question of consent were not then available.</text>
            <text syncTime="344.668" offset="1515641">The Circuit Court held, Judge Frankel held that the exigent circumstances doctrine including the hot pursuit doctrine justified this pursuit and entry into the home.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.314" offset="1606234">The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, however, had reversed the trial court because there was no finding of consent.</text>
            <text syncTime="374.977" offset="1636850">In turn, the Wisconsin Supreme Court by a vote of four votes to two found that consent was not necessary to be shown in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="607.864" offset="2568376">Yes, Justice O'Connor, I believe it does for two reasons, and I think they are illustrated by the law of Wisconsin.</text>
            <text syncTime="613.718" offset="2591782">The first point is that reasonableness under Fourth Amendment standards requires a balancing of the actual governmental interest asserted to justify invasion.</text>

            <text syncTime="627.997" offset="2648938">That is determined by the legislature.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.860" offset="2656356">The legislature may view some offenses more seriously than other states balanced against the seriousness of the intrusion.</text>

            <text syncTime="1517.982" offset="6208905">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1520.692" offset="6219667">As indicated by the Petitioner the State in this case relies on the exigent circumstances doctrine which established the reasonableness of a warrantless entry under that doctrine the warrantless entry to arrest or to search that he made if the police possessed probable cause and exigent circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.237" offset="6305872">In this case the primary exigent circumstances relied upon by the state is the need to obtain evidence before it is lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.153" offset="6341607">The police were after Mr. Welsh to arrest him for drunk driving and as the Court has indicated in Schmerber in a case for drunk driving or intoxication offense the evidence will dissipate gradually in the blood and over a period of time will disappear.</text>
            <text syncTime="1572.237" offset="6425930">Therefore, there was a need to immediately enter the home in order to obtain the evidence as soon as possible.</text>
            <text syncTime="1579.741" offset="6455919">A delay that may have been occasioned by obtaining a warrant during a delay even if not all evidence of intoxication would have been lost there would have been a period of some dissipation of the alcohol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1592.721" offset="6507850">It is just unknown how much would have been lost.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.813" offset="6520180">It is also important because there is no way until the police have contacted the suspect for them to know when he stopped drinking so he may have already stopped several hours before, still be intoxicated and by the time they get a warrant no longer be intoxicated.</text>

            <text syncTime="2078.311" offset="8450211">The police officer at that point also checked the license plate on the car to obtain some identification of the driver and at that point went to the address listed to that person.</text>
            <text syncTime="2088.838" offset="8492321">So before he had gotten to he house he had talked to Mr. Jablonic.</text>

            <text syncTime="2108.410" offset="8570583">In the Mackey v. Montrym case the Court said then in order for the State to protect people from drunk drivers the State has to have the authority to obtain a breathalyzer test for evidence of intoxication at the earliest possible moment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2123.769" offset="8632023">Again, that is simply what this officer said he was trying to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2126.591" offset="8643308">That is why he went to the house and did not try to get a warrant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2130.024" offset="8656996">I think the exigent circumstances prong of this to get into a house has been satisfied with a need to obtain this evidence.</text>
            <text syncTime="2142.112" offset="8705375">The other prong is probable cause which in this case the Petitioner says is not a problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.045" offset="8725124">So under those two tests it would appear that the police were justified in going in the house.</text>
            <text syncTime="2153.960" offset="8752814">However, as I understand Petitioner's objection now is that we cannot apply this exigent circumstances test because drunk driving was not a felony and was not a serious enough offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2166.118" offset="8801401">Our first response to that on this major-minor distinction is that drunk driving is a very serious offense.</text>

            <text syncTime="2807.497" offset="11366939">I would like to answer Justice Steven's question insofar as I have been informed by the principle counsel for Mr. Welsh.</text>
            <text syncTime="2818.026" offset="11409049">He was convicted at a jury trial in early 1982 at which his refusal to take the blood test was in evidence which is permitted now under South Dakota v. Neville.</text>
            <text syncTime="2832.194" offset="11465682">Secondly, Officer Daley testified as to what he saw in the bedroom and Mr. Jablonic testified.</text>
            <text syncTime="2838.970" offset="11492850">Mr. Jablonic incidentally did not smell the errant driver's breath.</text>
            <text syncTime="2844.823" offset="11516255">For one reason or another he did not smell it, but the jury did convict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2848.804" offset="11532138">One of the jurymen was the wife of one of my law students, and this is one of the sources of my information.</text>
            <text syncTime="2855.830" offset="11560245">Secondly, this Court has considered the problem of carnage on the highways in a number of instances, but I want to call your attention to and remind you of Craig v. Boren, an interesting case because of the way Justice Frennan dealt with the problem of statistics which Oklahoma had shown that there was a very high probability or a higher probability of drunken driving offenses committed by young men than by young women but that despite the statistical features which were really quite overwhelming it did not justify a deprivation of the Fourteenth Amendment claim to equal protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2894.435" offset="11714681">Similarly this Court in South Dakota v. Neville in a footnote indicated that perhaps the blood alcohol test would not have been appropriately taken or would not have been appropriately mentioned in the case if it had been forced upon the Defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.649" offset="11799527">My point is that this Court has recognized that in the battle against drunk drivers there still are Fourteenth Amendment protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="2922.873" offset="11828471">Similarly in Mincey v. Arizona this Court has declined to find a murder scene exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="2930.288" offset="11858146">My final slogan and I think this is a helpful one is that exigency is not the same as expediency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.414" offset="11894613">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
