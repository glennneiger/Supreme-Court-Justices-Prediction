            <text syncTime="18.648" offset="222183">The issue in this case is whether the establishment clause prohibits a municipality from including a creche in a traditional and dominantly secular Christmas celebration.</text>
            <text syncTime="32.643" offset="278190">The city of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, has for over 40 years sponsored an annual Christmas celebration.</text>
            <text syncTime="41.042" offset="311835">It consists of parties, Christmas carols, the lighting and decoration of public buildings, and a display situated on the grounds of a museum in the center of the commercial area of the city.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.599" offset="382053">The display, which is laid out over 40,000 square feet, consists of a wishing well, colored lights, a 40-foot high lighted spruce tree, figures of Santa Claus, a live Santa Claus, and various figures of stars and bells and lights and a large Season's Greetings, 48 feet long and lighted.</text>
            <text syncTime="86.839" offset="495006">Included in this display, covering approximately 14O square feet out of the total 40,000 square foot area, is a creche.</text>

            <text syncTime="120.776" offset="630738">The creche consists of a small stable and approximately 15 figures ranging in height from one foot to five feet.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.679" offset="682356">The District Court has permanently enjoined the city from continuing its practice of including the creche in its Christmas celebration.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.816" offset="726869">It did so by applying the three-part test set forth by this Court in Lemon against Kurtzman, concluding that the city's sponsorship of the creche violated each portion of that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="157.341" offset="777024">The Court of Appeals, by divided vote, affirmed, agreeing with the District Court as to the first two parts of the Lemon test, but further invalidating the city's sponsorship of the creche under the strict scrutiny analysis applied by this Court in Larson against Valente.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.130" offset="860198">It is the position of the city before this Court that the public recognition of the nativity scene in the American Christmas is not a promotion of religion, but really is an acknowledgement of the religious heritage of the American Christmas.</text>

            <text syncTime="238.698" offset="1102405">The private group has changed the location of the creche, but it is in the same area, but the city is enjoined from the practice of continuing it, and I might note that the record indicates that the particular creche in question had a useful life which was close to expiring and would probably have to be replaced in any event.</text>

            <text syncTime="317.398" offset="1417233">The city has had nothing whatever to do with the creche since this injunction was issued, and in fact the creche, while still in the same general area, has been moved.</text>
            <text syncTime="327.224" offset="1456521">It is submitted by the city that the distinction between the promotion of religion and the recognition of religion must be determined by examining the context in which the religious element is presented.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.840" offset="1531022">We respectfully submit that in this context the city is celebrating a legitimate national holiday and not promoting religious dogma.</text>
            <text syncTime="361.178" offset="1592358">Furthermore, we will contend that the Lemon test was inappropriately applied by the courts below because it was applied only to the creche, as though it existed in a vacuum, and it will be our submission that the appropriate focus for the Lemon test should be to the entire government activity and not really to the religious element contained within it.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.965" offset="1703535">This Court has frequently recognized that the traditions of the American people are saturated with religious influences.</text>
            <text syncTime="399.849" offset="1747003">As recently as the end of the last term, in March against Chambers, this Court sustained legislative prayer and legislative chaplaincies, noting that they have been imbedded in our traditions since the adoption of the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="414.592" offset="1806040">With respect to holidays, the Thanksgiving tradition also goes back to the First Congress, which requested President Washington to declare a day of national prayer and thanksgiving.</text>
            <text syncTime="431.041" offset="1871764">In McGowan against Maryland, this Court held that the recognition of Sunday as a day of rest was a legitimate public activity notwithstanding the fact that in so doing, it was aiding religions who attract worshippers on that day and who in fact receive some substantial portion of their financial support on that day.</text>

            <text syncTime="1156.070" offset="4771878">It follows in our view that a non-coercive acknowledgement of this undisputed fact... that one of the constituent elements of this recognized holiday is religious... is similarly constitutional.</text>

            <text syncTime="1192.523" offset="4917746">For the non-religious as well as for the religious, it is the most joyous of our holidays.</text>
            <text syncTime="1197.834" offset="4938957">Regardless of one's religious beliefs, Christmas is a time of homecoming.</text>
            <text syncTime="1203.691" offset="4962363">It is a time for family and friends, for gifts and parties.</text>
            <text syncTime="1208.187" offset="4980335">It is also a time of good will, and of concern for the needs of our fellow human beings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1214.590" offset="5006040">It is an eclectic holiday, and it has its symbols.</text>
            <text syncTime="1218.450" offset="5021400">One of those symbols is the creche, which is a reminder that of all the sources from which the American Christmas has grown over the years, one of them is religious.</text>
            <text syncTime="1230.585" offset="5069987">Neither in the Christmas context nor any other does the First Amendment require that we exclude enriching and important aspects of our history and our traditions as illegitimate and therefore as non-existent.</text>
            <text syncTime="1246.624" offset="5134144">It was not by governmental decree that Christmas acquired its religious aspect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1253.343" offset="5160998">That came about as a matter of undeniable historical fact, and to deny its existence, to exclude it from our national consciousness is nothing less, I submit, than intellectual and historical dishonesty.</text>
            <text syncTime="1268.336" offset="5220975">It is cultural censorship, if you will, which is a First Amendment concern, but not because the First Amendment requires it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1276.284" offset="5252740">Every single argument raised by the lower courts and by respondents against the creche are equally applicable to Christmas itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1285.701" offset="5290461">If Christmas can survive the First Amendment, as every party to this case concedes that it can, then so can an acknowledgement of the fact, the undisputed fact, that religion is one of its ancestors.</text>
            <text syncTime="1299.790" offset="5346781">The in-between position, which would keep Christmas as a national holiday but force a pretention that it is something other than what it is will not withstand analysis.</text>

            <text syncTime="1364.436" offset="5605393">Nevertheless, I simply submit that if you will take a sample of the efforts of other courts, state and federal, that have grappled with this issue of religious symbols and the First Amendment in the context of such things as the national motto and the pledge of allegiance and the creche and a number of other things, the madonna on the seal, you come away, I submit, with the unmistakeable conclusion that we have really lost sight of what the ultimate First Amendment inquiry is and that these three tests themselves have become the ultimate inquiry, and the reason is that they impart a kind of an artificial objectivity, and to use Justice Powell's language, analytical tidiness that in fact is non-existent, and they give the impression of having really accomplished the purpose without our ever examining what the true First Amendment values are.</text>
            <text syncTime="1424.395" offset="5845197">And for that reason, we submit that a test, if you want to put it in terms of purpose and effect, fine, but that it ought to concentrate on such things as a recognition first that it is a symbol, and starting from that premise, ask yourselves what it is a symbol of, and is it legitimately adjunct to something else, rather than being, is it promotional or is it merely commemorative.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.496" offset="5953658">And the final question that I would ask is, is it coercive?</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.526" offset="5965778">Now, with respect to the creche, I submit that of all of the possible symbols that government might have selected or that might be used by government, the least potential for coerciveness, or that there is none that has less potential for coercion than does the symbol.</text>
            <text syncTime="1472.768" offset="6038712">I like the use of, say, an anthem, or an oath of office, or a pledge, of allegiance whose religion-acknowleding words, the individual must either affirmatively state or be noticed for declining to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="1490.199" offset="6108407">The presence of an outdoor creche leaves the individual completely free to react to it however he or she pleases without anyone else knowing what that reaction is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1501.664" offset="6154278">Now, it is true that the primary issues presented by the creche are... we pidgeonhole them, we categorize them as establishment clause issues.</text>

            <text syncTime="1732.083" offset="7075982">It is, as all of the parties agree and acknowledge, the biblical account of the birth of Christ, the Christian Messiah, the Redeemer, according to the gospels of Matthew and Luke as contained in the New Testament.</text>

            <text syncTime="1984.966" offset="8087444">I have to admit that, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.369" offset="8097057">However, there is a big difference between an acknowledgement of religion without actually sponsoring a religious point of view as opposed to in this particular case, where we are not only acknowledging religion, but we are acknowledging a particular form of religion, notably Christianity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2006.082" offset="8171976">I do not think anyone can argue that the nativity scene does not depict the historical birth of Christ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2012.516" offset="8197680">We all acknowledge that Christ was born approximately 2,000 years ago.</text>
            <text syncTime="2016.248" offset="8212622">What the nativity scene does, it acknowledges the divinity of Christ.</text>
            <text syncTime="2020.312" offset="8228923">It acknowledges that the Christian Messiah has come, and that in conjunction with Easter, I think, in biblical terms any way, is indicative of and personifies precisely what Christians believe, to the exclusion of course, of all the non-believers and those individuals who do not have Christian philosophy or religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.033" offset="8319724">Approximately one week after this suit was filed, there was a press conference held at... in the display, in front of the nativity scene.</text>

            <text syncTime="2253.338" offset="9160972">The first was economic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2255.650" offset="9170271">The second was cultural and traditional, and the third was aesthetic.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.273" offset="9184691">The District Court, since there was no evidence offered as to the aesthetic value of the creche, made a finding that there was obviously no evidence to support that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.001" offset="9235682">He went on to address the issues... the reasons of economic, cultural, and traditional.</text>
            <text syncTime="2276.844" offset="9255013">The District Court found in applying the secular purpose test that the city's own witnesses... they had two witnesses, two merchants testify, and they admitted that the deletion of the creche from the display itself would have no economic impact on the downtown area, the commercial... the commercial area of Pawtucket.</text>
            <text syncTime="2298.397" offset="9341217">One of the reasons, obviously, that the city gave for including the creche was because it attracted shoppers.</text>

            <text syncTime="2306.940" offset="9375385">Also, as it related to the cultural and traditional reasons advanced by the city, the District Court found that the primary purpose and effect of the nativity scene was to advance religion.</text>

            <text syncTime="3358.327" offset="13580890">No, it would not be unconstitutional in my view.</text>
            <text syncTime="3361.388" offset="13593220">I believe that the Ten Commandments as contained in the frieze in this courtroom is not put there to advance religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.164" offset="13620283">I believe that it, in conjunction with other aspects of the freeze, it is intended to suggest the beginnings of law, the codification of law and how it began.</text>

            <text syncTime="3381.256" offset="13672632">Well, that is the argument, of course, of the city, that the display of the nativity scene is there to explain the origins of the Christmas holiday observation.</text>

            <text syncTime="3393.703" offset="13722474">But I think that in this setting here in this courtroom, the Ten Commandments in and of themselves do not suggest or advance religion, nor would anyone suggest that the purpose of having the Ten Commandmets in this courtroom is this Court's attempt to advance religion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.426" offset="13805334">Conversely, the Ten Commandments in Stone versus Graham, of course, was found to be a violation of the establishment clause because of its setting, and because of the use that it was being put to.</text>
            <text syncTime="3427.547" offset="13857788">This Court found, as you know, that the utilization of the Ten Commandments, even though the avowed purpose put in there by the school or by the state was merely to inculcate in children morals and a knowledge of the Ten Commandments, contained religious references to God and</text>
            <text syncTime="3450.086" offset="13947963">"Thou shalt not have strange gods before me. "</text>
            <text syncTime="3451.942" offset="13955382">and a variety of other religious references, and on that basis the Court found that there was a violation of the establishment clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.378" offset="13985161">I think that, as I said earlier, ultimately the courts will be asked to decide in each instance whether the erection of various religious symbols are permissible.</text>
            <text syncTime="3469.420" offset="14025285">An affirmance in this case will make clear to government, to people of this country of all religious persuasions, that sponsorship of religious symbols is not the business of government, and that government represents all people equally on the basis of their citizenship, and not on the basis of their religious affiliation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3488.212" offset="14100518">Thank you.</text>

            <text syncTime="3495.021" offset="14127685">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3497.115" offset="14136044">It is respectfully submitted that just as common sense tells us that the Ten Commandment in the frieze of this courtroom is not promoting religion but is symbolizing law, so on the record in this case common sense will tell us that the city is celebrating Christmas and not promoting religious dogma.</text>
            <text syncTime="3519.978" offset="14227578">The respondents in oral argument here have stressed the circumstances surrounding the religious element as determinative of its constitutional effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="3535.599" offset="14290062">That, we would respectfully submit, is precisely what the courts below refused to do in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3544.358" offset="14325066">The District Court stated that the city was overemphasizing the importance of context in evaluating the constitutional import of a symbol, and we respectfully submit that as respondent's argument has demonstrated here today, it is impossible to overstate the importance of context, because context makes the symbol what it is.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.066" offset="14447946">In response to questions of the Chief Justice, I would submit that the legislative prayers, the public prayers of the first Congress and the Thanksgiving proclamation of George Washington in 1789 were anything but perfunctory, and they were in fact an acknowledgement of the religious content in American life in a very sincere and forthright manner.</text>
            <text syncTime="3609.974" offset="14587545">The heart of the respondent's position in this case and the decisions below is that it is impermissible for government to keep Christ in Christmas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3626.512" offset="14653687">We would respectfully submit to this Court that it would be impermissible for government to put Christ in Christmas, it would be impermissible for government to take Christ out of Christmas.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.446" offset="14705409">The establishment clause requires strict neutrality.</text>
            <text syncTime="3643.662" offset="14722232">Christmas was put... Christ was put in Christmas by the traditions of the American people.</text>
            <text syncTime="3651.535" offset="14753788">This Court may recognize them, and the government may recognize them in the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3659.545" offset="14785762">Thank you.</text>
