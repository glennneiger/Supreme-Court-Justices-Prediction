            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="14.760" offset="204475">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.262" offset="218476">This case involves a dispute over the appropriate amount of federal financial reimbursement due a provider of medical services under the Medicare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="28.233" offset="258287">The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the district court concluded that reimbursement of the amount at issue was clearly precluded by the Medicare Act and the governing regulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="40.891" offset="308965">The Court of Appeals, on the other hand, held that the Government was estopped from relying on those statutes and regulations and must instead provide reimbursement contrary to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="51.180" offset="350134">We have sought certiorari because the Court of Appeals' decision is inconsistent with the repeated holdings of this Court that the Government may not be equitably estopped from enforcing the law.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.655" offset="399975">Respondent Community Health Services is a provider of health care under Part A of the Medicare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.076" offset="429650">Under Part A, the Federal Government, acting through private insurance companies, called fiscal intermediaries, reimburses providers for the reasonable costs of providing necessary medical services to Medicare beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="85.836" offset="488687">Congress set up a system under Medicare in which intermediaries make interim payments to providers on a monthly basis for the estimated cost of furnishing services, and then the providers' annual cost reports are audited later to determine the actual costs incurred and corrective adjustments are then made to account for overpayments or underpayments.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.134" offset="585967">In 1975 CHS began to receive grant funds from the Federal Government under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, or CETA, and the purpose of these grants was to provide job training and employment opportunities for unemployed workers.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.513" offset="655453">During the next several years, CHS hired a number of CETA workers and used the federal CETA grant funds to pay their salaries and fringe benefits.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.868" offset="696831">In addition, when CHS filled out its Medicare cost reports for the years in question it included the salaries it paid to the CETA workers as a reasonable cost attributable to the Medicare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.028" offset="753464">CHS did not, however, offset against those costs the amount of the federal CETA funds it received to pay those salaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="160.850" offset="788782">The obvious result of this bookkeeping was that CHS got reimbursed twice by the Federal Government for a single group of expenses, once by CETA and then again by Medicare.</text>
            <text syncTime="173.108" offset="837787">Not surprisingly, this double reimbursement was plainly contrary to Medicare regulations, which prohibit the inclusion in a provider's cost reports of expenses covered by so-called restricted grant funds, such as CETA.</text>
            <text syncTime="188.551" offset="899541">In fact, the published regulations expressly state that if restricted grant funds such as CETA funds were not offset from a provider's expenses, the provider would receive reimbursement for the same expenses twice, and that of course is precisely what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.079" offset="965683">Now, CHS included the salaries of the CETA workers in its cost reports, but did not deduct the corresponding CETA grant in part because the representative of its fiscal intermediary, Travelers Insurance Company, orally informed CHS on several occasions that the CETA grant did not have to be offset.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.128" offset="1061918">Travelers appears to have given CHS this erroneous advice by misreading the Secretary's so-called CETA grant was not.</text>
            <text syncTime="249.458" offset="1143211">In 1977, after CHS again asked Travelers if the CETA grants fell within the seed money exception, Travelers decided to ask the Department of Health and Human Services for its advice on the matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.449" offset="1195142">A month later HHS advised Travelers that the CETA grants did not fall within the seed money exception and that the grants therefore should have been offset on CHS' cost reports for the years in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="278.294" offset="1258568">Travelers then reopened CHS' cost reports for 1975 to 1977, as the statute required it to do, and determined that CHS had received overpayments in the amount of some 63,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="292.637" offset="1315933">Community Health Service sought administrative and judicial review of the intermediary's determination, and after an evidentiary hearing both the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, which is the expert administrative agency, and the district court agreed with the Secretary that the amount spent on the salaries of CETA workers was plainly not reimburseable under the Medicare Act because CHS had already recovered those expenses from its CETA grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="322.740" offset="1436305">The district court also rejected CHS' argument that the Secretary should be estopped from recovering the erroneous overpayments.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.179" offset="1474130">The district court found that CHS had not acted reasonably in relying on the intermediary's advice and that there was no evidence that the intermediary or the Secretary had been guilty of any misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="345.419" offset="1527107">As I mentioned a moment ago, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals reversed the district court's judgment.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.839" offset="1552707">The Court of Appeals did not find that the payments CHS had received for the CETA workers were in fact reimbursable under the Medicare Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="359.827" offset="1584680">Instead, the court held that the Government should be estopped from enforcing the governing Medicare statutes and regulations to recover the misspend funds because of what it termed the affirmative misconduct of the intermediary in giving CHS erroneous legal advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="379.240" offset="1662316">Now, the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case is impossible to square with the repeated pronouncements of this Court on the issue of estoppel.</text>
            <text syncTime="388.862" offset="1700873">The Court has consistently held, from the earliest days of the nation to as recently as two terms ago in Schweiker versus Hansen and last term in INS versus Miranda, that the Federal Government cannot be equitably estopped by the actions of its employees from enforcing public laws.</text>
            <text syncTime="408.326" offset="1778718">And this rule has always been applied with particular force in the context of suits for public funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="416.932" offset="1813095">The Court has said time and again that the lower courts must observe the conditions imposed by Congress for charging the public treasury.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="426.204" offset="1850189">Mr. Geller, can I ask you a question right there.</text>
            <text syncTime="428.323" offset="1858653">Supposing, instead of having an intermediary like Travelers as we have in this case, the query had been to somebody in the Department itself, perhaps to the General Counsel, and the General Counsel had given the answer that Travelers gave, and then later the General Counsel was replaced and a new General Counsel came in and said, my predecessor made a mistake.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.737" offset="1940364">Would the case be any different?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="449.670" stopTime="455.122">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="449.670" offset="1944021">The case would be no different, for reasons that I will get to in a little while, Justice Stevens.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.138" offset="1957918">The case would be exactly the same.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="455.122" stopTime="468.015">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="455.122" offset="1965859">Mr. Geller, do you see room in any case for a so-called "affirmative misconduct" kind of an exception for application of this rule?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="468.015" stopTime="524.301">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="468.015" offset="2017477">We have argued in our brief that there is no exception, because it's inconsistent with the whole analytical framework of the rule that the Government cannot be estopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="480.622" offset="2067841">The Court has alluded to it in the past, although it's never applied it, it's alluded to it, though never in the context of a case involving public funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.859" offset="2096785">The notion seems to have arisen in suits to deprive people of citizenship, and there may well be some due process notions that lurk in cases of that sort, but not in cases of this sort involving suits for public benefits where there is no statutory entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="503.138" offset="2157911">In any event, here the Court of Appeals, by invoking the doctrine of estoppel based on the alleged misconduct of Travelers Insurance Company, has prevented the Secretary from recovering amounts from CHS that are not authorized by the statute and as to which CHS has absolutely no statutory entitlement.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="524.301" stopTime="539.744">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="524.301" offset="2242548">Assuming, Mr. Geller, there is a statutory entitlement if someone had followed the correct procedure, but there was a representation by the General Counsel that this is the way to go about it and then it turns out it really wasn't?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="539.744" stopTime="555.203">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="539.744" offset="2304406">That would be very much like Schweiker versus Hansen, where there arguably was a statutory entitlement, but the procedures were not followed, and this Court said that the procedures are a part of the statutory entitlement.</text>
            <text syncTime="550.968" offset="2349232">Congress has required that the particular procedures be followed.</text>
            <text syncTime="553.837" offset="2360726">So the case I think would be no--</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>

            <text syncTime="556.655" offset="2372011">I think Schweiker versus Hansen holds as much.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="559.057" stopTime="571.132">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="559.057" offset="2381624">Would it be correct to say that CHS was no worse off so far as what it was entitled to get from the Government after it had followed the intermediary's advice than before?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="571.132" stopTime="574.951">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="571.132" offset="2429898">Well, I think that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="571.982" offset="2433347">It got the CETA funds in any event.</text>
            <text syncTime="573.834" offset="2440765">It just didn't get double.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="574.951" stopTime="577.769">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="574.951" offset="2445154">Now it has to pay them back, and it's because it wasn't entitled to them.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="577.769" stopTime="1235.442">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="577.769" offset="2456439">Yes, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="578.753" offset="2460409">Now, Respondents understandably have made little effort to defend the Court of Appeals decision, in light of this Court's precedents.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.142" offset="2489980">Instead, they have candidly urged the Court simply to abandon its long settled holdings in the estoppel area, calling them outmoded and socially unacceptable.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.516" offset="2535433">And the Court of Appeals for its part, while terming this Court's estoppel decisions archaic, found in some of the decisions what it took to be an affirmative misconduct exception that it applied in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="611.507" offset="2591440">We have explained at some length in our brief why both of these assertions are incorrect.</text>
            <text syncTime="617.242" offset="2614323">As to Respondents' contentions, there simply are a number of significant constitutional and policy reasons why it would be wholly inappropriate to prohibit the Government from enforcing a law concerning public benefits because of the erroneous statements of its employees.</text>
            <text syncTime="633.937" offset="2681092">If this Court were to adopt such a rule, it would really have the effect of raising employees of the Federal Government to the status of legislators, because it would give to their actions and words the force of law, even though those actions and words were inconsistent with the actions and words of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.882" offset="2748906">Here, for example, the Medicare Act and the regulations governing it clearly provide that the expenses covered by the CETA program are not reimbursable as reasonable costs.</text>
            <text syncTime="664.808" offset="2804599">Yet Travelers would in effect be allowed to repeal this portion of the Act and overrule the judgments of Congress simply by giving its providers advice to the contrary.</text>
            <text syncTime="676.449" offset="2851201">And needless to say, such a rule would create tremendous administrative burdens, opportunities for abuse and evasion of statutory mandates, especially in the context of massive social welfare providers like those under the Social Security Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="691.209" offset="2910238">The Court noted these very considerations only recently in adhering to its estoppel rulings in the Hansen case.</text>
            <text syncTime="699.379" offset="2942943">Let me give the Court some notion of the extent, the magnitude, of the medicare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.267" offset="2962483">There are some 16,000 providers.</text>
            <text syncTime="707.469" offset="2975231">In the last fiscal year more than $38 billion was expended.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.389" offset="2994979">Intermediaries and providers are constantly having discussions, most of it oral, about how particular costs should be handled.</text>
            <text syncTime="721.144" offset="3029983">If every time an intermediary orally gave a provider advice about how costs should be handled, if the Secretary were bound by that even though that advice was contrary to the Medicare statute the system would break down.</text>
            <text syncTime="736.571" offset="3091632">And of course, providers could frequently claim that they received oral advice even if they never got it.</text>
            <text syncTime="742.808" offset="3116605">That was, of course, one of the concerns that prompted this Court's decision in Schweiker versus Hansen.</text>
            <text syncTime="750.514" offset="3147430">But even if this Court were otherwise disposed to reconsider its estoppel decisions, as Respondents urge, or to imply an affirmative misconduct exception, as the Court of Appeals suggested, we think this would be a wholly inappropriate case in which to do, and we think that for two reasons.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.459" offset="3219214">First, we submit that CHS failed even to meet the requirements for estoppel under the law applicable to private persons.</text>
            <text syncTime="778.581" offset="3259756">And second, the actions of Travelers fell far short of any showing of affirmative misconduct as that term has been construed in this Court's prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="789.039" offset="3301552">I'd like to discuss each of these points in turn.</text>
            <text syncTime="792.491" offset="3315345">First, whatever the proper rules are for applying estoppel against the Government, it seems obvious that those rules should be at least as strict, at least as strict as the rules that would apply in private litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="806.500" offset="3371351">In other words, at a minimum the party seeking to estop the Government should have to meet the traditional requirements for estoppel in non-Government cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.790" offset="3408550">One of those requirements has always been that the party asserting estoppel show that it reasonably relied on the other party's erroneous advice, and it's clear from the very framework of the Medicare Act that a provider such as CHS could never reasonably rely on the advice of an intermediary as being the final definitive word on legal questions that may arise under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="841.655" offset="3511995">Now, Congress, as I mentioned earlier, chose to fund providers under the Medicare program on an interim reimbursement basis, making it clear that the final determinations would be made later on and there would be retroactive adjustments to take account of overpayments or underpayments.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.600" offset="3575838">And perhaps more to the point, the Secretary under this express statutory mandate has promulgated regulations making it clear beyond any doubt that determinations by an intermediary on the treatment of costs are subject to reopening and revision by the Secretary within a three-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="878.013" offset="3657445">Now, the relevant regulation that covers this situation is reprinted at page 4 of our brief.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.500" offset="3683358">It's 42 U.S.C. 405.1885, and it bears careful scrutiny in light of CHS' estoppel claims in this case, because this regulation specifically informs providers that an intermediary's determinations HHS within a three-year period notifies the intermediary that its determinations were</text>
            <text syncTime="916.222" offset="3810313">"inconsistent with the applicable law, regulations on general instructions by the Secretary. "</text>
            <text syncTime="923.809" offset="3840615">And this language, we submit, could not be clearer.</text>
            <text syncTime="926.844" offset="3852736">It unambiguously notifies all providers, such as CHS, that the Secretary and the courts and not intermediaries have the final word on what payments are permissible and what payments are not permissible under the medicare programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="944.037" offset="3921490">This statute and this regulation unambiguously notify all providers such as CHS that an intermediary simply doesn't have the authority to make any final determinations concerning the interpretation of statutes or regulations or otherwise to bind the Secretary to erroneous advice.</text>
            <text syncTime="964.200" offset="4002156">The Respondents have never suggested how they could have reasonably relied on the intermediary's advice in this case in light of this regulation, which expressly states that every piece of advice, every determination that an intermediary makes in determining cost bases is subject to reopening by the Secretary within a three-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="984.448" offset="4083136">And this regulation even allows the Secretary, Justice Stevens, to reopen her own prior determinations.</text>
            <text syncTime="991.970" offset="4113229">So that it is clear under the Medicare program the way Congress has set it up, that all determinations are subject to reopening within a three-year period if the Secretary determines that the preliminary determinations were contrary to law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1008.645" offset="4179998">Now, the Court of Appeals did not address this reasonable reliance point.</text>
            <text syncTime="1013.633" offset="4199956">It simply assumed that CHS had satisfied the traditional estoppel requirements and then it went on to discuss this more cosmic question of whether the Government can ever be estopped.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.857" offset="4244782">As I mentioned earlier, the Court of Appeals held that this Court had given what it called tacit recognition to the theory that the Government could be estopped in the instances where there was affirmative Government misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1039.784" offset="4304550">And the Court of Appeals reached this conclusion by attempting to distinguish away five of this Court's decisions and by reading the language of the Court, negative implications in the language of the Court in several of these decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1054.126" offset="4361915">On a number of recent occasions this Court in fact has alluded to the possible existence of an affirmative misconduct exception to the rule against estopping the Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1063.416" offset="4399009">But the important thing is that in each of those cases the Court found it unnecessary to resolve the question because the conduct at issue did not constitute affirmative misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1074.088" offset="4441745">Nonetheless, the lower courts have seized on the dictum in this Court's decisions and have branded as affirmative misconduct a number of actions that aren't really misconduct at all, such as in INS versus Miranda, much less affirmative misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1089.281" offset="4502558">Here, for example, the Court of Appeals concluded that Travelers' actions in erroneously advising CHS in good faith about some legal question that arose under the Medicare Act is affirmative misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1103.974" offset="4561281">But it's baffling how this sort of good faith error of judgment, giving advice of this sort, could be considered affirmative misconduct within the meaning of this Court's prior decisions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1114.015" offset="4601405">The conduct of Travelers here doesn't seem appreciably different from the Government agent's conduct in the Merrill case, where a Government agent told someone erroneously that his wheat crop would be covered by Government insurance; or in Montana versus Kennedy, where a Government agent told some woman that she needed a passport to return to the United States even though she didn't; or more recently in Schweiker versus Hansen, where a Government social security representative told a claimant that she was not entitled to social security benefits, even though she was, and told her not to even apply for them, which was in fact contrary to an internal manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1153.057" offset="4757618">In each of those cases the Court found not merely that the Government's actions did not constitute affirmative misconduct, but they fell far short of constituting affirmative misconduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.133" offset="4809967">And we think the Court's decisions in this consistent line of cases compel the conclusion that the intermediary's actions in this case also fell far short of the sort of conduct that might conceivably estop the Government if there was an affirmative misconduct exception.</text>
            <text syncTime="1182.243" offset="4874333">I'd like to turn to just one more point, because the Court of Appeals' decision... there are a couple of errors that seem to pervade the Court of Appeals' decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1190.080" offset="4905680">I'd just like to discuss them briefly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1191.699" offset="4912158">One is this notion that CHS did everything it could here to get the right answer to its problem and therefore it acted reasonably; and second is this notion that the intermediary violated some mandatory duty in not seeking advice from HHS.</text>
            <text syncTime="1209.076" offset="4981644">As to this first point, CHS was getting double reimbursement for a single expense from two parts of the Federal Government.</text>
            <text syncTime="1217.564" offset="5015603">The district court said that should have raised a red flag.</text>
            <text syncTime="1220.214" offset="5026261">It should have proceeded with extreme caution since that's so unusual, to get double reimbursement for one set of expenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="1226.251" offset="5050398">If CHS had looked at the governing regulations and the statute, it would have had substantial doubts that what it was being told by the intermediary was correct.</text>

            <text syncTime="1460.134" offset="5985895">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.619" offset="6003867">While the facts here are not in dispute, the emphasis placed on the facts is far different from the standpoint of CHS.</text>
            <text syncTime="1475.394" offset="6046917">If we turn the clock back to 1975 and a little bit earlier, we find that the Federal Government had a task force for the comprehensive health planning program in the United States and a local task force in western Pennsylvania.</text>
            <text syncTime="1495.306" offset="6126643">Crawford County had been designated as an underserved community medically and at this point in time the only agency that provided any Medicare services to any of the residents... these are home health services... was Community Health Services, and they provided them only in a small part of the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1527.027" offset="6253494">Now, the Medicare Act provides, I believe, seven different types of services that might be rendered by a home health agency.</text>
            <text syncTime="1543.721" offset="6320262">At the point we begin the story CHS was only into one aspect of it, this nurse, visiting nurse thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="1554.596" offset="6363730">The other areas were not being covered for Medicare beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1560.148" offset="6385987">Under the definition of a home health service, it has to be not only a non-profit organization; it also has to be qualified as a charitable organization.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.376" offset="6450875">Now, under Medicare when an agency such as CHS renders a service to which Medicare beneficiaries are entitled they must also render the same service to everyone in the community.</text>
            <text syncTime="1595.254" offset="6526421">So in effect, they now have to offer charitable services identical to those which they offer to the Medicare beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1605.529" offset="6567485">Now, faced with this situation in 1975, being unable to serve the community... and parenthetically, it is interesting to note that perhaps the Secretary of Health and Human Services had an obligation under the Public Health Act to provide the employees to do this.</text>
            <text syncTime="1628.394" offset="6658914">But at any rate, there was money available from the Department of Labor in the CETA program, and while this does provide... one part of it provides for training.</text>
            <text syncTime="1640.202" offset="6706143">Other parts provide for the expansion of public services.</text>
            <text syncTime="1643.904" offset="6720981">And it is under this aspect, the expansion of public services and particularly health services that many of the CETA people worked.</text>
            <text syncTime="1654.526" offset="6763508">Now, it also must be noted here that CHS not only was involved in providing services to Medicare beneficiaries; they were involved in providing services to non-Medicare beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1671.221" offset="6830277">So that in the testimony it's pointed out that only about 50 percent of the CHS services were for Medicare beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="1681.862" offset="6872805">Their other services were directed to other people that did not involve Medicare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1686.247" offset="6890359">Now, how does this become important?</text>
            <text syncTime="1689.199" offset="6902166">When Mr. Wallach approaches Mr. Reeves about this problem... he has the opportunity from the grants from the Department of Labor; he needs to expand services to Medicare beneficiaries; he can see, however, the opportunities, that if you have this seed money concept applying you're going to generate additional income which you can then use in the seed money concept of the expansion of your services to fill these needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1728.408" offset="7059005">At the time Mr. Wallach visited with Mr. Reeves, CHS didn't even have a Medicare manual.</text>
            <text syncTime="1735.830" offset="7088680">They had no bookkeeping set up.</text>
            <text syncTime="1737.297" offset="7094532">So it wasn't just a question of seed money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1739.732" offset="7104354">He was with Mr. Reeves on setting up the entire bookkeeping system for CHS so that they could account for everything in a proper manner.</text>

            <text syncTime="1778.424" offset="7259103">But my point is that it was not just a simple question about the seed money situation, it was concerned with setting up a whole bookkeeping program so that everything would be done in a proper fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="1790.331" offset="7306751">But one thing that has not been analyzed here, but it's this hypothetical question: If at the time Mr. Wallach went to Mr. Reeves for the answer the answer had been to offset, at that point CHS had the opportunity to use the CETA employees for services in the community not at all involved with Medicare.</text>
            <text syncTime="1819.951" offset="7425242">In other words, one of the services that the CHS made available in the community is a homemaker service.</text>
            <text syncTime="1827.273" offset="7454499">Now, the cost for homemaking service is not covered by Medicare.</text>

            <text syncTime="1888.292" offset="7698587">I mean, this is the hypothetical as to what would have occurred, the ability to use the employees on the Department of labor grants in a non-conflicting way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1898.666" offset="7740070">But at any rate, as to this question of whether this was proper, could this be interpreted as seed money grant, it was in fact interpreted as a seed money grant and acted out as a seed money grant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1912.490" offset="7795345">Seed money grants were not new.</text>
            <text syncTime="1916.128" offset="7809869">Back in the sixties in the mental health, mental retardation program, the Secretary had this rule about not deducting restricted funds.</text>
            <text syncTime="1929.952" offset="7865144">The funds for mental health and mental retardation were restricted funds and the Secretary nonetheless said that, because this was for the expansion of services, that they would not offset the mental health, mental retardation staffing grants.</text>
            <text syncTime="1947.063" offset="7933689">And so that's the history of the interpretation by the Secretary in other factual circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="1955.769" offset="7968485">But in this case there was certainly an arguable basis that these were seed money grants according to an interpretation of them, although people may argue about the interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1968.511" offset="8019476">In any event, it was in fact treated as seed money.</text>
            <text syncTime="1972.479" offset="8035254">It was treated as seed money and used that way, and it would not have been except for this inducement to do it this way.</text>
            <text syncTime="1980.652" offset="8067959">As a consequence of what happened on this instruction of Mr. Reeves... it was repeated and repeated and repeated for nearly three years... other employees were hired, CETA people provided services to Medicare patients, which they didn't otherwise have to do, and they developed a program to try to solve the health community problem for the entire community.</text>
            <text syncTime="2007.902" offset="8177046">Now, you can't unscramble the situation three years later and go back and retroactively put CHS in the position it was.</text>
            <text syncTime="2018.258" offset="8218424">Now, there's much that's suggested in the brief that there was some excess of funds and it makes it out as if CHS was a profiteer.</text>
            <text syncTime="2025.948" offset="8249144">Far from that, as a charitable institution every time they expanded and offered a new service to help the Medicare beneficiaries they had to take in people on a charitable basis that were not eligible Medicare beneficiaries.</text>
            <text syncTime="2042.559" offset="8315600">Now, who paid that?</text>
            <text syncTime="2044.392" offset="8322914">Every year CHS ended up in a deficit situation because it was trying to do all these things for so many people.</text>

            <text syncTime="2267.136" offset="9213898">And Blue Cross in its history, in order to minimize the cost to its subscribers and with a position of leverage over hospitals, was able to make that arrangement so they got the benefit of restricted money that went into charitable institutions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3130.040" offset="12665510">On the other hand, he may contend, well, it was the Secretary's duty to publish all this information and put it out and to have a policy, and in the absence of any policy what was I to do?</text>
            <text syncTime="3141.245" offset="12710336">I might note here that one of our contentions below was that in 1975 when Mr. Reeves made the decision, he has testified that there was no policy by the Secretary, and he had searched high and low and there was none.</text>
            <text syncTime="3158.957" offset="12781180">When he testified later before the Provider Benefit Review Board, he said he still wasn't aware of any that had ever existed back at that period of time.</text>

            <text syncTime="3228.236" offset="13058287">Shouldn't there be... should our system of jurisprudence today he brought up to the point where, if the Government has a serious contention that someone's raiding the Treasury... and I don't mean for the money here... that they would prove that, that they would prove why a court would not grant equitable relief.</text>
            <text syncTime="3247.131" offset="13133938">That's my contention, that if you use the ordinary principles of estoppel... that is, full knowledge of the facts to the other party, detrimental reliance, change of position, et cetera, et cetera... where is the Government harmed by that if they have the opportunity to show that a court of equity under the circumstances that they contend exist should not give equitable relief?</text>

            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="3284.790" offset="13284507">I'd just like, if I could, to clear up a few points made in Mr. Hasley's argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="3289.544" offset="13303525">The first, as I understand it the Respondent claims that the affirmative misconduct here was Travelers' violation of this mandatory duty it apparently had to communicate with HHS about this question it had gotten.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.886" offset="13364965">There's nothing in the statute or the Medicare regulations or in the contract that intermediaries sign with HHS that in any way imposes a mandatory duty to communicate every question they get from the provider.</text>
            <text syncTime="3317.611" offset="13415851">Obviously, an intermediary can't consult HHS on everything or else the whole system would break down.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.148" offset="13438003">There'd be no reason to have intermediaries if every time an intermediary got a question it had to pass it along to HHS.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.502" offset="13463394">Obviously, an intermediary has to use some discretion, and perhaps here bad judgment was exercised, but it was not a violation of a mandatory duty.</text>
            <text syncTime="3338.190" offset="13498189">And I might add that some perhaps some duty would arise to pass along to HHS a question when the provider specifically asks the intermediary to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3348.398" offset="13538940">But once again, I repeat here, there's no evidence that CHS ever asked Travelers to get an interpretation from HHS.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3357.588" stopTime="3370.329">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3357.588" offset="13575720">Mr. Geller, if the intermediary is negligent in some way, is it your thought that it could be held liable?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="kenneth_s_geller" startTime="3370.329" stopTime="3460.552">
            <label>Mr. Kenneth S. Geller</label>
            <text syncTime="3370.329" offset="13626711">Now, there the Government has taken the position that intermediaries are agents of the Government and therefore they have no independent liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="3377.182" offset="13654088">There is in fact a regulation, 42 CEP 421.5, which explains that the Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administrator is the real party in interest in any suit arising under the Medicare Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.925" offset="13713125">As Mr. Hasley mentions, however, they have sued Travelers in this case and that is an issue that the Third Circuit has not yet adjudicated.</text>
            <text syncTime="3399.679" offset="13744054">But Respondents claims here time and again that it has an entitlement to a binding answer of any question it has under the Medicare program.</text>
            <text syncTime="3408.018" offset="13777490">That's what it perceives as the affirmative misconduct here, a violation of this entitlement to a binding answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3414.106" offset="13801836">But there obviously can't be under the Medicare Act, where there are only interim payments and subsequent adjustments, a binding answer.</text>
            <text syncTime="3420.844" offset="13828795">And the regulation that I read earlier, 405.1885, is conclusive that an intermediary can't give a binding answer and that an answer that even the Secretary gives can be reopened within a three-year period.</text>
            <text syncTime="3434.419" offset="13883025">It is, once again, quite instructive that the Respondent has not yet explained what that regulation means or how it could have reasonably relied on the intermediary's advice in the face of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="3445.643" offset="13927956">The Respondent says it all boils down to the scope of authority of an agent, and as this Court has said on many occasions, employees of the Executive Branch, it is not within their authority to amend Acts of Congress; they are subject to Acts of Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="3459.219" offset="13982290">Thank you.</text>
