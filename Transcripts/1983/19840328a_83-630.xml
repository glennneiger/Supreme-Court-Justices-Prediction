            <label>Mr. Cornish F. Hitchcock</label>
            <text syncTime="35.782" offset="278831">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="39.594" offset="294086">Eleven years ago in the case of In Re Griffiths, this Court held that it was a violation of the equal protection clause for a state to require United States citizenship as a condition for being admitted to a state bar.</text>
            <text syncTime="52.370" offset="345182">The question before the Court today is whether, in light of the Griffiths decision, a state may constitutionally require citizenship as a condition for being licensed as a notary public.</text>
            <text syncTime="63.068" offset="388022">The Petitioner in this case is a lawful resident alien who in 1978 applied to the Texas state authorities for a license as a notary public, and he desired to use license in connection with his job as a paralegal with a legal aid organization in Texas.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.467" offset="457613">The state authorities denied his application solely on the basis that he was not a United States citizen and therefore ineligible under the statute at issue before you.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.355" offset="501185">This Court has indicated that in assessing state classifications and restrictions involving aliens, the general standard of review is strict scrutiny, although there are exceptions in some areas.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.442" offset="549459">For example, the Court has held that states are able to deny aliens certain rights, such as voting or running for elective office.</text>
            <text syncTime="110.534" offset="577880">And especially pertinent for today's case is the Court's holdings that citizenship may be a relevant factor if the state imposes the restriction in connection with certain appointive positions where the individual is exercising powers of the state that go to the heart of representative self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.245" offset="660741">Our position is that the statute in this case is to be judged under the strict scrutiny standard of Griffiths, but even under the more deferential standard applied for certain of these appointive positions we are still entitled to prevail.</text>
            <text syncTime="144.224" offset="712672">Let me focus for a minute, if I may, on the qualifications it takes to become a notary public in Texas and also on the nature of the function.</text>
            <text syncTime="152.220" offset="744646">In order to become a notary public in the State of Texas, one must fill out a one-page application... and Mr. Bernal's application is part of the record... that gives one's name, address, and requires the answers to four questions: Are you 18 years of age; are you a citizen of the United States of America and Texas; are you a resident of the county for which you are applying; have you ever been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude?</text>
            <text syncTime="177.366" offset="845165">There's a requirement of notifying the Secretary of State and the county clerk of any changes of address.</text>
            <text syncTime="183.036" offset="867840">What's interesting is what is not required.</text>
            <text syncTime="186.160" offset="880378">There is no requirement that one say one is familiar with what a notary does in Texas, nor, interestingly enough, is there a requirement that the application be notarized.</text>
            <text syncTime="195.202" offset="916532">The functions of a notary are relatively straightforward.</text>
            <text syncTime="198.779" offset="930847">A notary in Texas is allowed to witness signatures on documents, to administer oaths, take depositions, and authenticate documents.</text>
            <text syncTime="207.229" offset="964597">And the nature of the functions of this office are important because the Court has discussed these in a number of situations when the lesser standard of review has been applied.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="216.023" offset="999810">Do those functions differ much from the functions of notaries public generally?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="cornish_f_hitchcock" startTime="220.396" stopTime="238.685">
            <label>Mr. Cornish F. Hitchcock</label>
            <text syncTime="220.396" offset="1017364">No, they are rather similar to the functions of notary publics.</text>
            <text syncTime="223.583" offset="1030112">They are similar to the functions that Mr. Bernal performed when he was a notary public in Indiana four years, and they're also identical to the functions that are performed by commissioners of the superior court, an office to which lawyers are appointed in Connecticut, which was in the Griffiths case.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="249.275" offset="1132826">--as opposed to statutory authorization, such as in Griffiths?</text>

            <label>Mr. Cornish F. Hitchcock</label>
            <text syncTime="253.008" offset="1147768">--In our view, Justice O'Connor, there is no difference between the fact that an office is created in the constitution and the fact that the office, such as commissioner of the superior court, is created by statute.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="263.519" stopTime="268.704">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="263.519" offset="1189773">Well, does it indicate that the state considers the office more important?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="cornish_f_hitchcock" startTime="268.704" stopTime="672.325">
            <label>Mr. Cornish F. Hitchcock</label>
            <text syncTime="268.704" offset="1210566">I would say it indicates that the state does consider the office slightly more important.</text>
            <text syncTime="274.202" offset="1232509">But I think it's important to focus on the nature of what the statute and the constitutional provision are involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="280.777" offset="1258840">In the first place, the Texas constitution merely states that the office is created, and there is discretion that is left to the legislature to decide the qualifications, the standards, what regulation should be imposed.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.335" offset="1313071">Interestingly enough for this case, the state's argument that this is an important position because it is in the state constitution really cuts both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="304.206" offset="1352568">It took a century before, until 1945 at least, that a residency requirement was imposed by the Texas legislature, that one be a citizen of the state, an ambiguous phrase at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="315.170" offset="1396453">Citizenship of the United States was not required until 1965.</text>
            <text syncTime="319.668" offset="1414426">So in that sense the argument does cut both ways.</text>
            <text syncTime="323.464" offset="1429577">One final point, if I may.</text>
            <text syncTime="324.931" offset="1435428">The state's argument that this is an important post because it's in the constitution has the problem with it that what the state is saying in effect is that, we have greater discretion to discriminate provided we name the post in our state constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="339.677" offset="1494465">And we're not aware of any authority that gives the state that leeway, and there would be the potential hazard that states would seek to get more deferential review by simply naming posts in their constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="350.733" offset="1538664">With respect to the Griffiths case, the office of commissioner of the superior court was a public office, it was created by the statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="360.152" offset="1576385">Now, the restriction in Griffiths on being admitted to the state bar carried with it the restriction on being a commissioner of the superior court, and let me focus specifically on what a commissioner of the superior court does.</text>
            <text syncTime="372.054" offset="1623928">Despite the very grandiose name, the commissioner of the superior court is essentially a notary public, and lawyers sign documents, notarize documents in Connecticut as commissioners of the superior court with their own signature.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.158" offset="1676382">They don't need a seal.</text>
            <text syncTime="385.908" offset="1679412">When one is admitted to the Connecticut bar as an attorney, one takes a second oath immediately after that attorney oath as a commissioner of the superior court, and that is the nature of the office.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.997" offset="1731761">What's important about Griffiths and important about the restriction with respect to commissioners of the superior court is that the State of Connecticut in Griffiths raised precisely the same arguments that are being advanced here, that lawyers as commissioners of the superior court are being entrusted with the actual performance of government power and that the state has given meaning to the phrase that they are officers of the court.</text>
            <text syncTime="423.066" offset="1827996">And this Court answered the question in language which we think is highly pertinent here, where the Court said that giving a lawyer the authority to issue writs and subpoenas or to witness signatures or to administer oaths is not a matter of state policy or a matter of such unique responsibility that only citizens can be entrusted with that responsibility.</text>
            <text syncTime="443.886" offset="1911275">In light of the similarities between what Texas notaries public do and Connecticut commissioners of the superior court do, we submit that Griffiths is controlling and that the statute should be judged on constitutional... under strict scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="457.535" offset="1965923">The state here has presented no evidence that aliens as a class are so untrustworthy, disloyal to the United States, or incompetent that they must all be excluded from performing this role, from administering oaths, from witnessing signatures, and so forth.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.294" offset="2036871">The Secretary of the State has the power to issue qualifications.</text>
            <text syncTime="479.043" offset="2051918">There's a bonding requirement, a recordkeeping requirement, civil liability for negligence or for intentional wrongdoing, and criminal liability.</text>
            <text syncTime="487.945" offset="2087549">These are the sorts of regulations that should assure proper performance regardless of citizenship.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.099" offset="2112104">If the state's argument is accepted in this case, what will happen is a very curious anomaly.</text>
            <text syncTime="501.064" offset="2140003">Under the state's argument, an alien in the State of Texas can go to law school, can be admitted to the Texas bar, can practice law, and can draft a whole host of legal documents that have a significant impact on the public.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.607" offset="2194128">But that alien, that lawyer, will not be able to notarize the documents that he or she has drafted.</text>
            <text syncTime="520.355" offset="2217116">We believe that this anomaly is inconsistent with the equal protection standards of this Court and that it should be struck down under the strict scrutiny test.</text>
            <text syncTime="530.225" offset="2256613">Let me turn now, if I may, to the state's argument that a more deferential standard of review is appropriate here because we're dealing with an office involving execution or formulation of policy factors that go to the heart of representative self-government.</text>
            <text syncTime="546.844" offset="2323069">This Court indicated in Sugarman against Dougall and most recently in Cabell versus Chavez-Salido that there are two standards that must be met.</text>
            <text syncTime="555.918" offset="2359431">First, in order to take advantage of this more deferential standard, the state must show that the restriction is sufficiently tailored to meet its ends, that it's not over-inclusive or under-inclusive; and secondly, that we really are dealing with one of these significant sovereign functions of the government.</text>
            <text syncTime="572.614" offset="2426200">The restriction in this case fails on both counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="576.004" offset="2439784">The restriction is over-inclusive because it denies qualified resident aliens such as Mr. Bernal, who performed the functions of a notary for four years in Indiana, the opportunity to get a commission.</text>
            <text syncTime="587.484" offset="2485655">And it's also under-inclusive because there's another state office which performs similar functions, the office of court reporter.</text>
            <text syncTime="594.761" offset="2514808">Court reporters are officers of the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="597.698" offset="2526511">They are licensed by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="599.494" offset="2533720">There, I believe, is a committee to deal with unauthorized practice of court reporting.</text>
            <text syncTime="603.930" offset="2551484">And they certainly perform functions that we find it hard to believe are less important than those that are performed by notaries public.</text>
            <text syncTime="612.021" offset="2583771">But however, these court reporters are not required to be citizens.</text>
            <text syncTime="615.441" offset="2597459">Finally, there is another anomaly here, that the Secretary of the State of Texas, who actually is responsible for licensing notaries, is not required to be a citizen.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.250" offset="2636747">What the Texas statutory scheme has done is what was aptly described in Cabell: The state has indiscriminately swept in a variety of menial occupations, while leaving out some of the state's most important political functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="638.665" offset="2690351">Turning now to the second part of the standard, the application of the Sugarman exception for sovereign functions of government.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.646" offset="2726295">There are several common themes that run through the Court's cases in which this restriction, in which this lower standard, more deferential standard, has been applied.</text>
            <text syncTime="657.268" offset="2764852">In the first case, the cases where the standard has been applied involving policemen, school teachers, deputy probation officers, all involved public employees, state municipal employees, who were on a public payroll.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="672.324" offset="2825038">Do you think all those cases are consistent?</text>

          <turn speaker="cornish_f_hitchcock" startTime="674.245" stopTime="705.279">
            <label>Mr. Cornish F. Hitchcock</label>
            <text syncTime="674.245" offset="2832666">Well, I think that if some of the cases had come out differently we would have an easier time in this case, Justice Blackmun.</text>
            <text syncTime="682.492" offset="2865684">But your question leads me to the other common threads here.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.194" offset="2880522">What the Court has done is identified several important functions, two important functions, law enforcement and education, and has allowed there to be restrictions in deference because of the importance of law enforcement and education to the exercise of the state's functions.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="705.279" stopTime="714.432">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="705.279" offset="2956800">I suppose it's fair to say the Court's been cutting back from what, a more extreme position taken in Griffiths?</text>

            <text syncTime="714.432" offset="2993475">Well, the restrictions have... the last three cases have applied a more deferential standard and have upheld the restrictions.</text>
            <text syncTime="723.990" offset="3031719">Our position again is that this case is governed by strict scrutiny and this discussion of the more deferential standard comes in only if the Court says that strict scrutiny is not applicable in this situation.</text>

            <text syncTime="746.654" offset="3122311">No, Griffiths would have to be overruled in order for the state to prevail in this particular action.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.840" offset="3143105">The other thread that I was referring to is that we are dealing with functions that go to the sovereign functions of government, the exercise by the state entrusting individuals with the performance of state functions.</text>
            <text syncTime="768.550" offset="3209978">It's one thing to give individuals the power to build bridges, such as civil engineers do in Flores de Otero, but when engineers build bridges they're not exercising the sovereign function of the state even though they're licensed by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.123" offset="3264208">When lawyers draft contracts, they may be licensed to do that, but they're not exercising sovereign power.</text>
