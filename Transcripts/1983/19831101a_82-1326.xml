            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="151664">We will hear arguments first this morning in Secretary of the Interior against California and others, and the consolidated cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="12.978" offset="203491">Mr. Solicitor General, you may proceed whenever you are ready.</text>

            <text syncTime="16.960" offset="219478">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="20.913" offset="235256">Oil and gas leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf occurs in four distinct stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="27.831" offset="262946">The first stage is the preparation by the Secretary of Interior of a five-year leasing plan.</text>
            <text syncTime="33.375" offset="285097">It is followed by the lease sale, exploration, and finally production and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="39.748" offset="310593">The statutes also provide for step-by-step decision making throughout these four stages in a process which has two major aspects.</text>
            <text syncTime="49.650" offset="350195">The first aspect is that each decision is made at a time when an optimum amount of information needed to support that particular decision is available.</text>
            <text syncTime="60.380" offset="393140">The second aspect is that the decision to proceed through any given stage of the total OCS process does not imply a commitment to any later stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.860" offset="439011">The question in this case is one of statutory interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="74.968" offset="451445">It is whether the substantive requirement of Section 307(c)(I) of the Coastal Zone Management Act that federal activities directly affecting a state's coastal zone be conducted in a manner that is consistent to the maximum extent practicable with approved state coastal zone management programs applies at the lease sale stage, the second of the four stages, in all instances.</text>
            <text syncTime="101.427" offset="557293">The most helpful guide to what the statute means is what the statute says.</text>
            <text syncTime="107.595" offset="581953">What brings the CZMA's substantive requirements into play is not a functional relationship or a link in a chain of events, it is rather a direct effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.293" offset="628764">Out of the several accepted meanings, dictionary meanings, meanings approved by decisions of this Court of that word "direct", not one of them, not one, supports the Respondents' position in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="131.554" offset="677875">And, indeed, the Respondents have not even suggested any.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.851" offset="686965">There are several meanings of the word that are directly helpful to the issue before this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.490" offset="709535">Among other things, it is language of proximity, of certainty, of immanence, language that says there will be no intervening agency or event.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.951" offset="751435">Just last term in Bowsher versus Merck this Court, in construing the word "direct" in another context said, and I am quoting,</text>
            <text syncTime="158.574" offset="785917">"That whether the reference that the word obviously. "</text>
            <text syncTime="167.196" offset="820399">"It is plain from the face of the provisions that these are words of limitation requiring some close connection between the type of record sought and the particular contract. "</text>
            <text syncTime="176.753" offset="858642">There is the requirement of some close connection between the thing directly affected and the directly affecting entity.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.562" offset="893855">In any event, whether the reference is to this Court's ruling in Bowsher or whether it is to any ordinary dictionary definition, it is very clear that the words "directly affecting" are the complete antithesis of the remote and speculative circumstances that obtain at the lease sale stage of Outer Continental Shelf phase development.</text>
            <text syncTime="205.742" offset="974626">At that stage, it is uncertain, for example, whether there will be any hydrocarbons found at all; whether if they are found, they will be oil or gas and how and where they will be brought ashore.</text>
            <text syncTime="219.410" offset="1029274">There may be effects on the coastal zone from what happens on the Outer Continental Shelf, but in this case and almost all cases those are effects from what may or may not happen years after the lease sale at the time of exploration or production and development.</text>

            <text syncTime="329.002" offset="1467608">In 1976 and 1978, Congress amended respectively the CZMA and the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="338.829" offset="1506897">Though the hearings for the amendments to the two statutes were held in tandem and certainly the two have to be considered in tandem, and it was in those amendments that specific provision was made for phased decision making.</text>
            <text syncTime="355.009" offset="1571680">The OSC leasing process is one which, by its very nature, lends itself to decision making by stages.</text>
            <text syncTime="362.304" offset="1600833">The total process takes years, and in some instances, even decades, but there are identifiable points along the line at which decisions have to be made whether to proceed further.</text>
            <text syncTime="373.063" offset="1643883">Now, as an integral part of this comprehensive change to phased decision making, Congress provided in Sections 11 and 25 of the OCSLA, added in 1978, and in Section 307(c)(3)(B) of the CZMA which is the only section that deals expressly with Outer Continental Shelf transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="397.070" offset="1739909">That these consistency certifications with their substantive capacity to halt further development would be made at the exploration stage and at the production/development stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="415.283" offset="1812738">That is expressly dealt with by Section 19 of the OCSLA which provides for state input of information regarding the size, timing, and location, which, analogous to NEPA the Secretary of Interior must take into account and must give reasons for his rejection of the state's suggestion.</text>

            <text syncTime="763.486" offset="3205587">My reliance on what happened in '76 and '78 simply... strengthens our view as to (c)(1).</text>
            <text syncTime="771.900" offset="3239233">During the course of the legislative debates, the Executive Branch expressed its concerned that at the lease sale stage we simply don't know enough.</text>
            <text syncTime="782.180" offset="3280297">And, if you will look at page 30 of our brief, you will see that Congress shared that view.</text>
            <text syncTime="787.928" offset="3303285">They shared that concern that the leases were being stopped at the lease sale stage and as a consequence they opted for the phased development.</text>
            <text syncTime="797.548" offset="3341842">The net result was that the original language, which included leases within its consistency certifications requirements, was dropped and in its place or instead rather Section 307(c)(3)(B) was added.</text>
            <text syncTime="816.511" offset="3417702">It was a new section.</text>
            <text syncTime="817.618" offset="3422090">It is the only part of the entire statute that deals with OCS transactions.</text>
            <text syncTime="822.603" offset="3442048">And, as a net result, the provisions of the CZMA which deal with CZMA applicability to OCS transactions are identical to the provisions of the OCSLA dealing with CZMA applicability to OCS transactions namely, that CZMA's substantive requirements apply only at the exploration and production and development stages and that is what expressly Section 307(c)(3)(B) says in the CZMA and that is what Sections 11, 19, and 25 of the OCSLA says.</text>
            <text syncTime="857.979" offset="3583527">And, any other view puts these two necessarily related statutes out of sync with each other.</text>
            <text syncTime="866.535" offset="3617800">At the lease sale stage what happens is it is a procedural requirement of coordination, involvement, cooperation that the Secretary is required to consider, but there is no substantive authority to stop the project.</text>
            <text syncTime="884.765" offset="3690629">Now, the Respondent's contention is that a CZMA obligation at the lease sale stage is imposed on the federal government by the directly affecting language and this gets to Justice Steven's question.</text>
            <text syncTime="900.335" offset="3752905">There are at least two flaws in that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="902.831" offset="3762936">The first one is that it flies in the face of what the statute says for reasons already discussed, means direct.</text>
            <text syncTime="909.561" offset="3789894">It simply cannot mean something that may or may not come about depending on events which have not yet occurred.</text>
            <text syncTime="918.059" offset="3823853">That is an undisputed description of the lease sale circumstance and it fits no definition of the word "direct".</text>
            <text syncTime="926.586" offset="3857917">Second, if Congress... If the reason that Congress eliminated the blanket requirement of consistency determinations at the lease sale stage from the only part of the statute that expressly deals with OCS transactions after months of consideration of the issue was because of some sudden discovery that it was already contained in another part of the Act that was already in existence, Congress surely would have said so.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.167" offset="3972229">If Section 307(c)(1), which is the directly affecting section, already contained a CZMA lease sale requirement, why did Congress give such extensive consideration to whether that self same requirement should be written in the OCS subsection?</text>
            <text syncTime="971.942" offset="4039416">There is not one word in the legislative history that so much as hints that the reason that leasing was not included, indeed, was deleted from Section 307(c)(B) was redundancy.</text>
            <text syncTime="985.844" offset="4095004">It was rather impracticability, incompatibility with the phased development of the OCS that was the centerpiece.</text>

            <text syncTime="1142.715" offset="4722466">There is a regulatory definition within the Department of Commerce as to the policy matters the Secretary of Commerce may consider.</text>
            <text syncTime="1150.054" offset="4751827">To my knowledge, no successful appeal has yet been invoked, but I should add that this statute still is rather new to us.</text>
            <text syncTime="1159.176" offset="4788294">There is little experience under it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1162.096" offset="4799997">I would like to also amplify, Justice Stevens, one of the answers that the Solicitor General gave to one of your questions.</text>
            <text syncTime="1173.576" offset="4845868">At the later stages, under 307(c)(3)(B), it is not simply a matter of lessee compliance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1181.246" offset="4876588">The Secretary of the Interior, under Section 11 and Section 25 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, is directed not to approve the requisite permits for exploration or production and development unless consistency is achieved.</text>
            <text syncTime="1199.847" offset="4950985">So, he doesn't step out of the picture.</text>
            <text syncTime="1202.113" offset="4960075">He is very much into the picture.</text>

            <label>Mr. E. Edward Bruce</label>
            <text syncTime="1223.571" offset="5045862">--I would go back even further.</text>
            <text syncTime="1225.946" offset="5055370">I would go back to 1953 and consider what Congress did in reaction to this Court's decisions in the so-called tidelands oil controversy, look at that determination, and then ask the question whether the statutory language that they used in 1972 and the legislative history associated with the 1972... radically changed that.</text>
            <text syncTime="1248.532" offset="5145754">The Plaintiffs say that it did, but the Plaintiffs offer no definition, as the Solicitor General has told us, of the term "directly affecting" that begins at all to comport with their position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1259.903" offset="5191207">To the contrary, it is their position in their briefs... California's position that the meaning of these terms are unclear and they urge upon this Court what they themselves characterize as a broad, liberal, or expansive definition in order to suit their needs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1277.175" offset="5260275">They not only ignore the language of Section 307(c)(1), they ignore the very specific arrangements of Section 19 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, where in 1978 Congress addressed this very question, what role shall we create for the states in the OCS tract selection process at the leasing stage and provided an arrangement quite different than the one that emerges from their interpretation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1304.007" offset="5367690">They ignore 307(c)(3)(B) and what it says about the role of the CZMA in the OCS process and they ignore Sections 11 and 25 that interlock these two.</text>
            <text syncTime="1313.974" offset="5407501">Now, how do they justify this?</text>
            <text syncTime="1316.552" offset="5417845">They do it ultimately on a policy argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1319.238" offset="5428608">They say really that OCS leasing is simply so important that we simply must have this authority, we must have input at the leasing stage.</text>
            <text syncTime="1328.842" offset="5466955">There are three, at least three dispositive answers to that argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.056" offset="5487853">In the first place, this Court has repeatedly held in recent years and in past years that we start with the language with which Congress expressed itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1344.913" offset="5531217">We don't ask the judges to delve into policy and create a different scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.753" offset="5554622">A second answer is this: In 1978, when the OCS Lands Acts was completely revised, Congress addressed the very policy question upon which Plaintiffs stand here; that is the need for state input into the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1368.465" offset="5625466">That was defined as a major policy goal of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1373.199" offset="5644379">When Congress did that it adopted Section 19.</text>
            <text syncTime="1377.867" offset="5663083">Indeed, it adopted it at the urging of California, Massachusetts and other states who, notwithstanding the existence of the 1972 CZMA said, we need a role in the tract selection process and Congress gave them that role.</text>
            <text syncTime="1395.094" offset="5731942">And, that role was for governors to make recommendations; that role was for the Secretary of the Interior to have final authority to assess a balance between state and national interests subject, of course, to judicial review in a well-defined means.</text>
            <text syncTime="1411.352" offset="5797039">Indeed, even in 1976, when Congress was addressing policy under the CZMA, in making these major amendments to that Act, taking into account the need to have an aggressive OCS program, it addressed the policy question and it said we are giving the states a right to apply their programs at these later stages, at exploration and development.</text>
            <text syncTime="1436.421" offset="5897244">And, the conference report said that this would satisfy state needs for complete information on a timely basis about the details of the oil industry's plans.</text>
            <text syncTime="1447.652" offset="5942175">That is, by the way, in our brief at page 42.</text>
            <text syncTime="1451.182" offset="5956386">Congress made this policy statement at exactly the time it was rejecting a proposal to make leases subject to consistency review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1460.084" offset="5991912">Congress has rejected their policy argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1462.896" offset="6003197">Congress has found an expression or place for the policy to be achieved elsewhere.</text>
            <text syncTime="1467.720" offset="6022528">A final answer to their policy argument, we submit, can be found in their steady resistance to offer to this Court or any court what would flow from adopting their directly affecting argument.</text>
            <text syncTime="1482.513" offset="6081669">What consequences would we have?</text>
            <text syncTime="1483.995" offset="6087625">In the lower court, certainly in the trial court, they said they would have final authority, recognizing the improbability, shall I say, of that position.</text>
            <text syncTime="1493.288" offset="6124719">They now retreat to some undefined degree of deference that would have if (c)(1) applies as they say it applies.</text>
            <text syncTime="1500.320" offset="6152931">The point to nothing in the CZMA, the OCS Lands Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, general principles of administrative law, that this Court or any court could consider in deciding how much deference they were due.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.123" offset="6208102">They would create, it seems to me, litigation over the years trying to make these case-by-case adjustments as the Ninth Circuit itself recognized.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.088" offset="6243942">Now, sometimes, indeed, all too often, this Court is confronted with statutory schemes where Congress hasn't been specific enough and litigation must be resorted to to solve these kinds of problems.</text>
            <text syncTime="1534.397" offset="6289186">We submit in this case the confusion implicit in the Plaintiff's position could be achieved only be ignoring Congress' repeated statements time and time again as to how these two statutory schemes are to work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1548.674" offset="6346342">We submit that the Court should hold that the leasing stage, the selection of tracts itself, does not directly affect the coastal zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1556.983" offset="6379569">The Court, in its opinion, should also recognize that Section 19 provides a ready means for state input into the process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1565.448" offset="6413424">In so holding, the Court would harmonize the two statutes, the CZMA and the OCSLA.</text>
            <text syncTime="1571.228" offset="6436516">It would recognize the basic policy position upon which the Plaintiffs stand, the need for state input, and it would channel disputes into a congressionally defined administrative mechanism with judicial review.</text>
            <text syncTime="1583.925" offset="6487298">We submit that this is a far better way to resolve the issues in this case rather than to indulge Plaintiffs in their expansive and liberal approach to the legislation which raises far more problems than it settles.</text>
            <text syncTime="1601.339" offset="6556993">If the Court has no questions, I will sit down.</text>

            <text syncTime="1615.725" offset="6614462">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1620.299" offset="6632853">I am going to try and explain this morning why it is important to apply state coastal zone management programs which are federally approved to the Department of Interior's Outer Continental Shelf leasing activities and how that process can, in fact, work.</text>
            <text syncTime="1639.761" offset="6710697">But, before I get to that point, I am going to be addressing what Petitioners' definition of the directly affecting test is.</text>
            <text syncTime="1650.239" offset="6752598">And, let me just say at the outset that they would like to have this Court define the phrase 307(c)(3) of the Coastal Zone Management Act solely be reference to the purposes and policies of an entirely different statute, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="1673.466" offset="6845489">Now, as Justice Stevens pointed out earlier, those amendments were not passed until 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="1680.745" offset="6874642">This entire system of phased development that they are relying on for their definition of the directly affecting test was a subsequently enacted statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="1691.286" offset="6916751">The words 1972 and that is the statute that is before the Court for construction.</text>
            <text syncTime="1700.922" offset="6955308">Let me also emphasize that it is a phrase we are talking about, "directly affecting the coastal zone".</text>
            <text syncTime="1710.324" offset="6992924">Petitioners would like to have the Court simply define the word "directly".</text>
            <text syncTime="1715.572" offset="7013927">That is not the issue here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1717.589" offset="7021973">It is legislative intent on that phrase in the Coastal Zone Management Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1722.524" offset="7041721">It is also important--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="1724.584" offset="7049976">When you say that the issue is not the meaning of the words "directly affecting", but instead it is the legislative intent in using those terms?</text>

            <label>Ms. Theodora Berger</label>
            <text syncTime="1734.692" offset="7090413">--It is the meaning of the phrase "directly affecting the coastal zone".</text>
            <text syncTime="1738.439" offset="7105355">It is not one word "directly", as Petitioners would have it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.467" offset="7121447">It is also important to focus on how Petitioners have suggested that that phrase be defined.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.011" offset="7155615">According to Petitioners, no federal activity directly affects the coastal zone unless it has immediate physical impacts on the coastal zone without subsequent governmental approvals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1766.238" offset="7216533">You will find that test in the Solicitor's brief and in the letter to California refusing to do a consistency determination for Lease Sale 53.</text>
            <text syncTime="1776.081" offset="7255925">Now, we have to ask ourselves where did that test come from?</text>
            <text syncTime="1780.172" offset="7272330">You can't find it in the legislation history.</text>
            <text syncTime="1782.546" offset="7281839">To the contrary, all of the legislative history contradicts that test.</text>
            <text syncTime="1786.590" offset="7297930">It doesn't really foster the purposes of the Act because this was an Act that was designed for the long-term management of the coastal zone through a process of federal/state coordination and cooperation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1801.349" offset="7356967">I submit that that process would not be fostered by a restrictive definition such as the one put forth by Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1809.114" offset="7388105">The only thing they can site for this narrow definition is the dictionary.</text>
            <text syncTime="1815.610" offset="7414018">Now, if you look... Again, the dictionary definition is only of the word "directly".</text>
            <text syncTime="1820.375" offset="7433140">It doesn't give us any definition of the phrase.</text>
            <text syncTime="1823.078" offset="7443902">But, if you look at the dictionary definition, you will not find the definition offered by Petitioners.</text>
            <text syncTime="1830.932" offset="7475354">The dictionary doesn't say that you have to have physical impacts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1835.307" offset="7492804">The dictionary doesn't say anything about subsequent governmental approvals.</text>
            <text syncTime="1840.383" offset="7513179">The only thing... The closest thing that they can find in the dictionary is the notion of intervening cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1847.442" offset="7541391">And, the trial court analyzed that test and said even under that test Lease Sale 53 would directly affect the coastal zone because this is the activity that sets in motion the whole chain of events which lead to the coastal zone impacts with which we are concerned.</text>
            <text syncTime="1865.356" offset="7613071">This is the key activity.</text>
            <text syncTime="1866.807" offset="7618818">The other important thing to understand about Petitioners' definition is that it virtually exempts all of the Department of Interior's significant OCS decision making; that is tract selection and the imposition of lease stipulations.</text>
            <text syncTime="1885.208" offset="7692484">Now, Mr. Bruce said this morning that under their definition tract selection is exempt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1891.845" offset="7719024">You will that also in the Joint Appendix at page 72.</text>
            <text syncTime="1896.454" offset="7737414">In the letter to California refusing to do the consistency determination, the Department of Interior explained that under their definition tract selection is not an activity that requires compliance with the Coastal Zone Management Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1910.353" offset="7793003">In fact, as I must admit, it is only in the rarest of cases under their definition that lease sales would ever come into this process of coastal zone management that was anticipated by Congress.</text>
            <text syncTime="1925.657" offset="7854234">And, in fact, there has only been on instance in the entire history of OCS leasing since 1972 that I am aware of where they have ever actually applied consistency to a lease sale.</text>

            <label>Ms. Theodora Berger</label>
            <text syncTime="1937.997" offset="7903553">That was an instance in Alaska, Your Honor, in 1977.</text>
            <text syncTime="1942.887" offset="7923197">That was a particularly unusual situation where the Department of Interior imposed a stipulation requiring the lessee to immediately build gravel islands and the Department felt that the gravel islands themselves would cause impacts on the coastal zone.</text>
            <text syncTime="1961.035" offset="7995713">Therefore, they did a consistency determination on the effect of building the gravel islands, but no consistency determination on the effect of the lease sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="1970.531" offset="8033747">Now, One of the main arguments of the Department of Interior is that you simply cannot apply the consistency process to their OCS leasing activities.</text>
            <text syncTime="1986.008" offset="8095605">It would be unworkable.</text>
            <text syncTime="1987.010" offset="8099680">You would have a morass of litigation and the very important federal OCS leasing program would grind to a halt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1994.895" offset="8131236">Well, I submit that that has been disproven, Your Honors, because as a result of litigation in this case, the Department of Interior has been forced to prepare consistency determinations all over the country for a great number of states.</text>

            <text syncTime="2073.271" offset="8444706">In five instances, the state said, no, we think there are problems for coastal zone management if you go ahead exactly as you have said, but they sat down together and they tried to resolve the problem in a way that would allow the lease sale to proceed while still taking into account these coastal zone management concerns.</text>
            <text syncTime="2093.607" offset="8525999">In each of those five instances, the Department of Interior reached a memorandum of understanding with the state which in no way interfered with the holding of the lease sale.</text>

            <text syncTime="2234.905" offset="9091184">These are very expensive propositions when you hold a lease sale.</text>
            <text syncTime="2238.248" offset="9104559">Lease Sale 53 alone, the total bids were over $2 billion, and Chevron bid $333 million for one tract in Lease Sale 53.</text>

            <text syncTime="2256.084" offset="9175925">The oil companies are not putting up that kind of money for the mere ability to apply for subsequent permits.</text>

            <text syncTime="2283.413" offset="9285222">307(c)(3) is, as the Court pointed out earlier, at a subsequent stage.</text>

            <text syncTime="2299.778" offset="9350737">The lessees come to the state for a consistency review under Section 307(c)(3) on a piecemeal, random basis, often one tract at a time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2311.575" offset="9397862">There is no way at that point to address the coastal zone impacts, if you will, of the lease sale as a whole.</text>

            <text syncTime="2388.293" offset="9704748">One of the major parts of the Department of Interior's decisions at the lease sale stage is the question of tract selection.</text>
            <text syncTime="2398.225" offset="9744559">That is the determination of where in a given area they are going to allow development through leasing and what areas they are going to exclude from development.</text>

            <text syncTime="2813.524" offset="11405737">The California Coastal Zone Management Program contains a policy which requires the consolidation of onshore support facilities for offshore oil and gas development.</text>

            <text syncTime="3451.556" offset="13957796">I might point out that the oil industry was lobbying heavily at that point asking that the consistency requirements be changed.</text>
