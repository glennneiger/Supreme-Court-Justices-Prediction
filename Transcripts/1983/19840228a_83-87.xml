            <label>Chief Justice Warren E. Burger</label>
            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="145003">We will hear arguments first this morning in Board of Education of Paris Union School District against Vail.</text>
            <text syncTime="11.389" offset="190456">Mr. Miller, you may proceed when you're ready.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_reed_miller" startTime="14.524" stopTime="245.024">
            <label>Mr. Thomas Reed Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="14.524" offset="203099">Mr. Chief Justice, may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="18.812" offset="220236">This case concerns an action brought by an Illinois public school teacher against its employer, the board of education, pursuant to U.S. Code Section 1983.</text>
            <text syncTime="35.423" offset="286691">More specifically, in final analysis this is a breach of contract case in which both the district court and the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in a two to one decision agreed that the public school teacher had a property right protected by the United States Constitution to continued employment, which was deprived of him when the board of education did not renew his probationary contract and did not provide to him reasons for nonrenewal, nor a hearing prior to that termination.</text>
            <text syncTime="75.581" offset="447292">Now, this case arises within a statutory framework called the Illinois tenure scheme, and I think because of its bearing on the case I would like to spend a few moments to elaborate in regard to that particular statutory scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.857" offset="512389">Illinois, like many states, has a statutory tenure scheme which applies to public school teachers.</text>
            <text syncTime="99.696" offset="543736">Specifically, in Illinois the tenure act is found in Sections 24-11 and 24-12 of the Illinois School Code.</text>
            <text syncTime="108.718" offset="579785">For the Court's identification, these statutory provisions are set forth at pages 56 through 61 of the appendix to the petition for writ of certiorari.</text>
            <text syncTime="119.860" offset="624402">In essence, the statutory scheme provides as follows: A public school teacher who is employed for two consecutive years in full-time service, that being the probationary period, acquires what we call tenure, contractual continued service in the State of Illinois.</text>
            <text syncTime="139.254" offset="701934">Once the teacher acquires tenure, a teacher cannot be dismissed for other than cause and only after a rather elaborate procedural process has taken place.</text>
            <text syncTime="151.929" offset="752716">To the contrary, the nonrenewal of a probationary teacher, whether it be a first year probationary teacher or a second year probationary teacher, is a rather simple procedure.</text>
            <text syncTime="163.287" offset="798064">The first year probationary teacher is entitled to nothing more than notice of nonrenewal to be given to that person at least 60 days before the end of the current school term.</text>
            <text syncTime="175.878" offset="848428">For a second year probationary teacher, a notice of nonrenewal must contain the reason or reasons for the nonrenewal.</text>
            <text syncTime="185.735" offset="887925">There are no express provisions found in Section 24-11 dealing with the termination of a probationary teacher in the current contract term.</text>
            <text syncTime="199.812" offset="944245">It should be noted that another provision of the Illinois School Code, that being Section 10-22.4, empowers a board of education in Illinois to dismiss teachers, whether they be probationary or tenured teachers, for the following reasons: incompetency, cruelty, negligence, immorality, or other sufficient cause, and, important to this case, whenever in the opinion of the board of education the interests of the school require the dismissal.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.185" offset="1089695">It is, as I have suggested, within this statutory framework that the facts of this case came to pass.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="245.024" stopTime="251.695">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="245.024" offset="1125013">Could the board dismiss in the middle of the first year for no cause?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_reed_miller" startTime="251.695" stopTime="270.139">
            <label>Mr. Thomas Reed Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="251.695" offset="1151762">In my judgment, yes, it could.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.413" offset="1162629">And the reason I say that is because whenever the interests of the school requires the dismissal means to me that the board can dismiss for any reason or no reason.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="270.139" stopTime="275.893">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="270.139" offset="1225532">Well, I would think you would apply to a tenured teacher.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas Reed Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="275.893" offset="1248520">It would, except for the statutory provision found in Section 24.12 which specifically says that a tenured teacher must be dismissed for specific cause.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="289.970" stopTime="298.776">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="289.970" offset="1304840">Well then, what about the provision that says you may dismiss a probationary teacher if you give him 60 days notice before the end of his first year?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="thomas_reed_miller" startTime="298.776" stopTime="322.124">
            <label>Mr. Thomas Reed Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="298.776" offset="1340053">That provision, of course, I think has been interpreted to mean the nonrenewal aspect of a probationary teacher's contract.</text>
            <text syncTime="306.581" offset="1371295">In other words, that person will serve out that first year and his contract will not be renewed for a second year.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.835" offset="1396268">Under the statutory scheme, unless that nonrenewal notice is given the teacher is automatically re-employed for the second year.</text>

            <text syncTime="322.574" offset="1435243">But that notice is just notice and not any sort of a hearing.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas Reed Miller</label>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="331.230" offset="1469829">Am I correct in recalling that none of the three judges on the Court of Appeals agreed with your analysis of state law?</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas Reed Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="338.550" offset="1499191">I think that can be gleaned from the fact that the dissenting justice did not discuss that in his dissent.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="346.056" stopTime="349.708">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="346.056" offset="1529179">He assumed there was some kind of a contractual right?</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Mr. Thomas Reed Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="349.708" offset="1543808">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="351.460" offset="1550809">The district court, after a bench trial, made the following findings which are pertinent to this case:</text>
            <text syncTime="359.547" offset="1583096">First of all, that the Respondent teacher had executed a one-year employment contract with the board of education.</text>
            <text syncTime="368.420" offset="1618623">Secondly, that a consensus of the board of education, a consensus of the board, had promised, and made the promise through an oral representation of the superintendent to the teacher, that his contract would be renewed at the end of the first contract year.</text>
            <text syncTime="386.147" offset="1689571">And that representation was made at the time of initial employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.768" offset="1708066">It was not made at the end of the first contract year.</text>
            <text syncTime="394.887" offset="1724471">Rather, it was made at the time of initial employment.</text>
            <text syncTime="398.607" offset="1739413">The Respondent relied in part upon this representation, as evidenced by the fact that he left his job in Joliet, Illinois, and moved to Paris, Illinois, to assume his coaching and administrative responsibilities.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.050" offset="1805137">Another finding was that the Petitioners in fact did notify the Respondent on March the 3rd, 1981, that his contract would not be renewed, and that renewal without more did meet the strict requirements of the probationary nonrenewal notice provisions of the school code.</text>
            <text syncTime="437.516" offset="1894998">The Respondent was given no reasons for his nonrenewal and, furthermore and finally, the Respondent was not given a pre-termination hearing.</text>
            <text syncTime="447.605" offset="1935331">As a matter of fact, he was not given a hearing by the board of education at all in this matter.</text>
            <text syncTime="453.759" offset="1959991">He did in fact bring suit in the federal district court a little more than a month after the notice of nonrenewal was given.</text>
          </turn>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>

            <text syncTime="473.089" offset="2037313">In addition to the findings made by the district court, the district court also made certain conclusions of law, which I think are important also.</text>
            <text syncTime="484.463" offset="2082766">The district court concluded that on the basis of the representation that was made at the time of employment that the board of education had bound itself to a two-year term contract with the Respondent teacher, and that this contract was enforceable under Illinois law, that being a one-year term written contract followed by a one-year implied promise or oral contract for the second year.</text>
            <text syncTime="514.499" offset="2202930">That was as a matter of finding enforceable under Illinois law.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.470" offset="2222783">The second finding or conclusion of law was that that two-year employment contract was property within the meaning of Section 1983.</text>

            <text syncTime="537.629" offset="2295507">You have a fairly tough row to hoe in this Court, I suppose you realize, because, you know, the district judge is obviously formerly an Illinois lawyer and three judges of the Court of Appeals did not take issue with that finding.</text>

            <text syncTime="552.171" offset="2353604">This is true, except I think that this Court has the opportunity to take a look at Illinois law in this case because of the fact that not one Illinois court has ever interpreted this particular provision, that being Section 24-11.</text>
            <text syncTime="574.435" offset="2442734">It has never been required to interpret that.</text>

            <text syncTime="577.337" offset="2454332">Do you really think that's why we would grant certiorari in a case like this, in order to look at Illinois law and see if it were properly applied by a district court and affirmed by a Court of Appeals?</text>

            <text syncTime="598.717" offset="2539805">But I think that the state law issue comes into play quite significantly when we talk about the property right, because as we know from this Court's prior decisions, property rights, particularly property rights in employment, are created by state law and not the Constitution.</text>
            <text syncTime="616.628" offset="2611485">And I realize that I have a tough row to hoe when it comes to this Court looking at state law.</text>
            <text syncTime="623.565" offset="2639174">But this is one of the points that we have raised, and we think that if the Illinois Supreme Court had been given the opportunity, had this case been filed in the state court system, that it would have held that Section 24-11 does not allow for more than two successive one-year term contracts.</text>
            <text syncTime="647.081" offset="2733320">And we say that primarily on the strength that under Illinois law public entities have only those powers that are granted to them by the state legislature.</text>

            <text syncTime="659.388" offset="2782534">Well, Mr. Miller, what if the board had given Vail the initial one-year contract, but at the same time had given him the statutory notice that he'd be re-employed for another year at the end of the first year?</text>
            <text syncTime="674.565" offset="2843243">Wouldn't that have given him a valid two-year contract?</text>

            <text syncTime="695.728" offset="2927880">So I think the argument that they can't have a two-year contract is essentially a weak one.</text>

            <text syncTime="703.584" offset="2959331">Well, the history of the Illinois Supreme Court in interpreting the tenure provisions has been that the court has strictly construed those provisions dealing with nontenured teachers and in fact has given a tremendous amount of flexibility to boards of education in dealing with the nontenured teachers.</text>

            <text syncTime="735.538" offset="3087122">As I would suggest to the Court, there are four points on which I think this Court can reverse this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="744.577" offset="3123276">The first we have discussed.</text>
            <text syncTime="745.611" offset="3127351">I will move on again into the other points.</text>
            <text syncTime="748.813" offset="3140203">The second is that under the Illinois statutory scheme a probationary contract is not a property interest within the meaning of the Constitution and Section 1983, and I say that because there is no for-cause standard for discharge found in Section 10-22.4, that being the statutory provision that sets forth when a board can or what a board can dismiss a teacher for.</text>
            <text syncTime="779.150" offset="3261516">It is our reading of this Court's cases, Both and Bishop, that a for-cause standard is necessary within the statutory framework to create the kind of property interest which is protected by the Constitution.</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="795.927" offset="3328703">This is only slightly different from your first argument, it seems to me, because you're really saying that if he had sued in state court he would be met with your point that there was no breach of contract because we can fire for no cause at all.</text>

            <text syncTime="3202.129" offset="12953467">I do, Mr. Chief Justice.</text>
            <text syncTime="3205.382" offset="12966528">Just briefly, I would like to go back to the remedy issue and, contrary to what counsel I believe was attempting to imply, there is no federal common law remedy to reinstatement under the facts of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3221.425" offset="13030685">As a matter of fact, I believe this Court's decision in Bishop, footnote number 14, would indicate that reinstatement for the failure to provide pre-termination hearings are very rare indeed and only occur in those situations in which the statute itself is a for-cause provision.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="3248.142" stopTime="3274.377">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="3248.142" offset="13137473">But Mr. Miller, if the law were perfectly clear, and I don't suggest it is, that the Constitution required a public employer to give a pre-termination hearing... say that was clearly the law... and you fired a man without giving him such a hearing, he promptly went into federal court and asked for an injunction, saying I want that hearing before the discharge becomes effective, are you saying a federal court would not in those circumstances have power to enter a temporary restraining order?</text>

            <text syncTime="3274.377" offset="13242485">No, I do not believe that... I believe that the federal court has that power to certainly issue that injunction.</text>
            <text syncTime="3281.547" offset="13271116">But what I am saying is that under Illinois law and I think the stated law of this Court that if there is shown a breach of contract that there is no remedy to reinstatement for an employee of this classification--</text>

            <text syncTime="3311.902" offset="13392533">What I am stating to the Court is that the board's interpretation of Illinois law was that no reason need be given to the Respondent for his discharge, because of the fact that Section 10-22.4 says that whenever in the best interest of the school a discharge is warranted you may discharge that person.</text>

            <label>Mr. Thomas Reed Miller</label>
            <text syncTime="3341.337" offset="13510293">This case I believe from my point of view cries out for state court determination, because of the facts that... or the points that there has been no state law determination of the probationary term contract, there has been no state law determination as to whether a term contract in a probationary framework is a property right.</text>
            <text syncTime="3368.671" offset="13619589">And the Seventh Circuit holds in this case that a term contract is a property right, and where do we draw the line?</text>
            <text syncTime="3379.977" offset="13664833">Do all elements of term contracts then have property vestage?</text>
            <text syncTime="3385.781" offset="13688030">Let's take, for an example, an element of the Respondent's contract, a fringe benefit that's a part of that total package.</text>
            <text syncTime="3395.720" offset="13727841">If that stick, if you will, is taken away from the Respondent without a pre-termination hearing, is that a violation of the Constitution?</text>
            <text syncTime="3406.544" offset="13771099">It appears to me that if this Court were to hold that all term contracts, and specifically in the backdrop of a state statutory tenure scheme, are property rights, that we certainly do open up the floodgates for the federal courts to determine not only whether this is or is not a property right, but also what process is due.</text>
            <text syncTime="3433.012" offset="13876947">What form does that pre-termination hearing take?</text>
            <text syncTime="3437.380" offset="13894502">Will that not be litigated extensively.</text>
            <text syncTime="3440.082" offset="13905264">If the Respondent was not satisfied in this case with the form of the pre-termination hearing that he got, that would be an issue that the federal courts would have to decide likewise.</text>
            <text syncTime="3453.941" offset="13960748">So for these reasons, the Petitioner board of education feels strongly that the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals decision should be reversed.</text>
