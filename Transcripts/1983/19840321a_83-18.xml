            <text syncTime="65.792" offset="413656">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="68.594" offset="424837">The issue before you today is whether the First Amendment's limitations on presumed and punitive damages apply to non-media defendants in actions for defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="80.802" offset="473738">Petitioner Dun &amp; Bradstreet has urged the Court to confirm that the First Amendment protects all speech against the award of presumed and punitive damages, absent actual malice.</text>

            <text syncTime="92.893" offset="522117">Mr. Garrett, would suggest that we would be ratifying what someone else has already said is correct.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gordon Lee Garrett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="103.317" offset="563808">Fully recognizing, Your Honor, the footnotes in several opinions dealing with private defamation, we believe that this Court's opinion in Gertz versus Robert Welch leads to the inescapable conclusion that on the one hand the states have no substantial interest in awarding presumed and punitive damages against any speech when balanced against the First Amendment protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="130.235" offset="671433">We believe that's why the word "confirm" is appropriate.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gordon Lee Garrett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="140.591" offset="712915">Your Honor, I agree with you.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.742" offset="721483">I think in this Court's opinions "private defamation" has been used to signify the status of the plaintiff, from a public figure, to a public official, to a private figure.</text>
            <text syncTime="156.583" offset="776863">But defamation by definition includes a publication to a third party.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.670" offset="801209">I think Your Honor is correct that there really is no such thing as private defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="169.642" offset="829108">When I speak of private defamation in this case, I am really referring to a private party, not a public figure or a public official.</text>
            <text syncTime="179.448" offset="868291">We believe a ruling which would--</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="183.050" stopTime="203.147">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="183.050" offset="882711">I thought perhaps you had it the other way around, that there is some concept that a private party does not share all the protections that all other persons share under the First Amendment.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gordon_lee_garrett" startTime="203.147" stopTime="254.113">
            <label>Mr. Gordon Lee Garrett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="203.147" offset="963064">--Absolutely not, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.998" offset="970482">We believe that the decisions of this Court recognize that the First Amendment is a freedom which is enjoyed by all, and that this Court doesn't make distinctions based on the speaker or his message in connection with defamation cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="225.060" offset="1050731">We believe that a ruling recognizing that neither presumed nor punitive damages could be allowed, absent actual malice, would do two very important things.</text>
            <text syncTime="236.802" offset="1097751">First, it would recognize the very legitimate and important state interest in protecting the reputational interests of citizens by allowing private defamation plaintiffs to recover damages for actual injury.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="254.113" stopTime="262.169">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="254.113" offset="1166923">Well, that isn't the result of any limitation.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.198" offset="1175282">That's the result of the basic state general damage award.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gordon_lee_garrett" startTime="262.169" stopTime="263.771">
            <label>Mr. Gordon Lee Garrett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="262.169" offset="1199211">I'm sorry, Justice Rehnquist?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="263.771" stopTime="274.160">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="263.771" offset="1205584">I thought you were saying the reasons why we should have this limitation on the states' authority are two, and one is the state ought to do what it isn't limited to do by this limitation.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gordon_lee_garrett" startTime="274.160" stopTime="373.575">
            <label>Mr. Gordon Lee Garrett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="274.160" offset="1247171">No, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="275.110" offset="1250933">My point was that if you recognize the rule which we suggest in our case you would do two different things: One, you would recognize that the states have an interest in protecting the reputations of their citizens, and that interest is satisfied by awarding damages for actual injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="296.140" offset="1335047">The second point is that it would also recognize that, absent actual malice, the states have no interest in awarding either presumed or punitive damages, and that when balanced against the First Amendment freedoms it precludes such an award.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.204" offset="1407354">Let me emphasize that Dun &amp; Bradstreet seeks only the same result that would be required in actions brought against newspapers, television, syndicated columnists.</text>
            <text syncTime="326.861" offset="1457927">Whatever the term "media" means, we believe that all citizens are entitled to that freedom under the First Amendment.</text>
            <text syncTime="335.650" offset="1493140">As I mentioned earlier, we believe that that ruling would flow naturally from the Court's holding in Gertz versus Robert Welch, which significantly recognized that the states have no interest in securing for defamation plaintiffs gratuitous awards of money damages far in excess of any actual injury.</text>
            <text syncTime="354.445" offset="1568269">We believe the highlights of the case before the Court recognize the very concerns which troubled this Court in Gertz: jury awards of presumed and punitive damages in wholly unpredictable amounts, bearing no relationship to the actual harm caused.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="373.575" stopTime="384.164">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="373.575" offset="1644755">Well, why are these damage awards so much different than awards in personal injury cases?</text>
            <text syncTime="378.694" offset="1665235">They're all going up nowadays.</text>
            <text syncTime="380.212" offset="1671295">Why shouldn't they go up against libel defendants, too?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="gordon_lee_garrett" startTime="384.164" stopTime="415.102">
            <label>Mr. Gordon Lee Garrett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="384.164" offset="1687178">Some of my colleagues at the libel bar would agree with you, Your Honor, that they are going up.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.235" offset="1711420">There is one fundamental difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="392.404" offset="1720092">In the case before the Court, where there was libel per se charged, the jury was instructed that damages are presumed.</text>
            <text syncTime="402.595" offset="1760843">Other torts do not allow a court to give presumed damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="409.265" offset="1787593">I should not say "allow".</text>
            <text syncTime="411.148" offset="1795116">States do not give damages for presumed injury.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gordon Lee Garrett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="417.202" offset="1819358">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.904" offset="1822074">And in an ordinary negligence case, for example, one of the key elements is injury, and that is why.</text>
            <text syncTime="425.141" offset="1851018">Plus... and I tend to forget this, too... we are balancing defamation laws against a corresponding First Amendment right, and in ordinary negligence cases there is not even that corresponding First Amendment right except as due process would require.</text>

          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="442.870" stopTime="464.150">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="442.870" offset="1921967">Your client isn't exactly in the position of the New York Times in New York Times against Sullivan, where the Court talks about the dangers of self-censorship and that sort of thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="454.294" offset="1967629">Really, no great social harm would be done if Dun &amp; Bradstreet did a little self-censorship when it comes to defaming people's business reputations, would it?</text>

            <label>Mr. Gordon Lee Garrett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="464.150" offset="2007126">I think, Your Honor, that it's important to focus on what chilling effect it would have on Dun &amp; Bradstreet.</text>
            <text syncTime="470.572" offset="2032830">I do not mean to suggest to the Court that Dun &amp; Bradstreet is going to go out of business.</text>
            <text syncTime="475.624" offset="2052997">In fact, it's been in business for a number of years.</text>
            <text syncTime="478.410" offset="2064177">But I think we must look, Your Honor, at two interests, one in the interest of the free flow of information generally, and secondly the interest in the recipients of Dun &amp; Bradstreet reports to get prompt, accurate information.</text>
            <text syncTime="494.437" offset="2128229">And let me be specific.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.954" offset="2134290">If Dun &amp; Bradstreet or any other non-media speaker, whatever that means, is subject to unlimited awards for presumed and punitive damages, I think two things will happen.</text>
            <text syncTime="509.281" offset="2187580">One, rather than publish something that cannot be triple checked and guaranteed, that information simply will not be published.</text>
            <text syncTime="519.070" offset="2226763">For example, Dun &amp; Bradstreet will oftentimes include in its reports information about how a creditor thinks a particular corporation or proprietorship pays its bills.</text>
            <text syncTime="534.096" offset="2286845">Now, when that person that is the subject of the report calls Dun &amp; Bradstreet and says, I don't agree with you, I was not slow 90 days, and then Dun &amp; Bradstreet calls the creditor to check that information and they say, well, we believe that's correct, but it's in our files, we can't be sure, if Dun &amp; Bradstreet is subject to unlimited awards, they simply won't publish that.</text>
            <text syncTime="557.012" offset="2378587">And it's important in the free flow of commercial information that the recipients of those reports know that.</text>

            <text syncTime="599.888" offset="2550055">And I think the Court struck the appropriate balance when in the Gertz case it says private defamation plaintiffs may be compensated for their actual injury.</text>

            <text syncTime="925.849" offset="3853878">But yet, in the instructions to the jury you got a special instruction for the privilege for credit reporting agencies, which kind of suggests maybe you're in a special narrow category.</text>

            <text syncTime="948.880" offset="3946038">You see, they also say this is commercial speech and it's not something distributed at large, that you don't need robust debate on whether somebody went into bankruptcy or not.</text>
            <text syncTime="955.967" offset="3974355">It's kind of a different, specialized area.</text>

            <label>Mr. Gordon Lee Garrett, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="959.869" offset="3989924">Your Honor, I must admit that I have a great deal of difficulty in deciding what is "media" and what is non-media.</text>
            <text syncTime="968.892" offset="4026078">As we indicate in our reply brief, many of the functions that Dun &amp; Bradstreet does are very analogous to what a newspaper does.</text>
            <text syncTime="978.815" offset="4065784">We send reporters out to get information.</text>
            <text syncTime="981.434" offset="4076233">The information is edited and sent to clients or prepaid subscribers of Dun &amp; Bradstreet.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.588" offset="4100892">The information relates to matters about commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="992.173" offset="4119178">Not much different, we suggest, than what's in the Wall Street Journal every day or the business page of any newspaper.</text>
            <text syncTime="1000.163" offset="4151152">Moreover, as I was reviewing the transcript of the case last night, I came across something which struck me, which I think directly goes to your question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1010.184" offset="4191276">One of the recipients of the Dun &amp; Bradstreet report was the manager of a local bank.</text>
            <text syncTime="1015.588" offset="4212801">He testified that the bankruptcy notice, which was quickly corrected, had nothing to do with the relationship between the bank and Greenmoss.</text>
            <text syncTime="1024.861" offset="4249895">But he also said: You know, I look at newspapers because I'm concerned about bankruptcies, and I use newspapers to inform me about that just as well as I do Dun &amp; Bradstreet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1037.086" offset="4298796">And I think that points out that many of the same functions done by Dun &amp; Bradstreet are done by newspapers and vice versa.</text>
            <text syncTime="1044.758" offset="4329516">And I believe the second aspect of your question dealt with the commercial speech doctrine.</text>
            <text syncTime="1051.345" offset="4355847">Your Honor, whatever commercial speech is, it is not speech about commerce.</text>
            <text syncTime="1057.115" offset="4378940">I don't think anyone would seriously contend that the statement Greenmoss is bankrupt, if it appeared on page 17 of the Vermont Daily Free Press, was commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1070.925" offset="4434215">We were not advertising anything.</text>
            <text syncTime="1073.277" offset="4443619">We were not promoting any of our products.</text>
            <text syncTime="1075.627" offset="4453023">This simply is not commercial speech.</text>
            <text syncTime="1078.463" offset="4464308">And we suggest blur is nothing more than an attempt to get around what we believe to be the central issue in the case, balancing the First Amendment rights of all speakers on the one hand against the states' limited interest in securing only awards of actual damages for private plaintiffs.</text>
            <text syncTime="1101.211" offset="4555318">We believe that the facts of this case highlight the very concern the Court recognized in Gertz.</text>
            <text syncTime="1108.284" offset="4583635">In July 1976 Dun &amp; Bradstreet sent the special notice to five subscribers of Dun &amp; Bradstreet.</text>
            <text syncTime="1116.488" offset="4616445">None of these subscribers was a customer of Greenmoss, a local building concern.</text>
            <text syncTime="1121.908" offset="4638179">It did state that Greenmoss had filed a petition in bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="1126.412" offset="4656151">As I indicated earlier, a retraction in the form of a correction notice was issued promptly.</text>
            <text syncTime="1134.615" offset="4688961">The complaint in this case sought damages of $7500 and $15,000 in punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="1143.957" offset="4726368">Yet, after a two-day trial the jury awarded $50,000 in compensatory damages and $300,000 in punitive damages.</text>

            <text syncTime="1971.487" offset="8036396">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1981.311" offset="8075789">It was not until 2:30 this afternoon that we heard for the first time that Dun &amp; Bradstreet claims that it is a media defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1990.250" offset="8111524">They never suggested that in this case before.</text>
            <text syncTime="1992.952" offset="8122287">So, in response to your question, this case came to the Court as a non-media defendant case, and they never asserted a media defendant position below.</text>
            <text syncTime="2005.510" offset="8172546">The questions that you asked about the facts I think raise some serious questions about just what went on here and I think show why the Gertz formula should not be used in this type of litigation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2019.686" offset="8229284">You asked the question, did they retract the whole way?</text>
            <text syncTime="2022.738" offset="8241405">Well, that was a major part of the trial in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2026.423" offset="8256242">Contrary to what's been said to you, in this case what happened was, after our client found out about the false report of bankruptcy they asked to find out who the report was submitted to so that they could engage in what Gertz says is the first remedy of a defamed plaintiff, self-help.</text>
            <text syncTime="2049.855" offset="8349970">And they couldn't get the answers to those very simple questions until the lawsuit was filed and until discovery was submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2058.711" offset="8385392">So Greenmoss found itself in the position of knowing that this information was being disseminated, but not knowing to whom and not knowing the breadth of the dissemination.</text>
            <text syncTime="2071.351" offset="8435860">And as the trial indicated, as the president of the company testified at length, he had a bizarre problem.</text>
            <text syncTime="2076.922" offset="8458221">Every customer that he visited with, he would not know whether that customer had heard about the bankruptcy.</text>
            <text syncTime="2084.442" offset="8488314">So he was forced into the awkward position of saying: Do you know that we're not bankrupt?</text>
            <text syncTime="2090.346" offset="8511929">That's a very extraordinary position for a businessman to find himself in.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.234" offset="8531469">So I think it is a whole course of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2098.686" offset="8545261">That's the way this case was tried.</text>
            <text syncTime="2101.304" offset="8555710">And with respect to whether Gertz was raised at the trial court level, we submitted some extensive information to the court in our brief about the fact that Gertz was not properly raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="2114.211" offset="8607328">In this case, the common law privilege was an open question in Vermont and that appeared to be all that Dun &amp; Bradstreet wanted.</text>
            <text syncTime="2125.003" offset="8650482">They only suggested Gertz as, in their words, "a second rationale" behind the protection that common law extended.</text>

            <text syncTime="2832.920" offset="11482156">Number one, there were no compensatory damages in fact awarded because what the trial court said was that, assuming there's a high enough level of culpability... that is, using that state common law test for commercial credit reporting agencies, Greenmoss had to prove culpability far higher than negligence to receive any verdict.</text>

            <text syncTime="2874.514" offset="11648504">The trial court said that substantial damages were not permitted unless Greenmoss proved they in fact occurred; and in the very next sentence said compensation had to be specifically related to damages that were actually caused by D&amp;B.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.227" offset="11723423">Further, compensatory damages here were only lost profits and and out of pocket losses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2900.481" offset="11752471">Now, the court allowed the jury to assess pre-judgment interest at Vermont's statutory rates on a per annum basis from the date of injury to the date of verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="2915.357" offset="11811926">Dun &amp; Bradstreet in its brief says that the most actual damages we showed was $36,000.</text>
            <text syncTime="2924.196" offset="11847243">When you calculate the interest on $36,000 at the rates the trial court allowed the jury to do, you come up with a figure of $50,022.30.</text>
            <text syncTime="2939.022" offset="11906593">I think that is exactly what the compensatory damage award did in this case.</text>

            <text syncTime="3215.093" offset="13010842">But the presumption that allows substantial damages without even an offer of evidence of actual injury, which is what you had in Gertz, is one thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3226.901" offset="13058071">But here the legitimate state function of presumed damages is that the intuition of common experience as it has found its way in the common law through centuries of defamation precedent counseled that it's certain that the harm proved is causally related to the defamation when those two things coexist in time.</text>
            <text syncTime="3252.801" offset="13161725">And I think that's really the function that the states have here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3257.003" offset="13178548">Bear in mind what Dun &amp; Bradstreet is asking this Court to do is to say that the states' interests don't matter, and the effect of this case if Dun &amp; Bradstreet is right will be without question to totally constitutionalize the state law of defamation.</text>
            <text syncTime="3275.648" offset="13253049">Now, I think there is another role or another state interest that states have in defamation, and that is the interest, as the Vermont Supreme Court pointed out, in the difference between an individual who lives in a world that is increasingly dominated by large commercial entities, may well be less able to bear the burden of the consequences of the falsehood than the business that sells the report.</text>
            <text syncTime="3304.734" offset="13369451">I think that's another legitimate state interest involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3308.555" offset="13384706">Finally, Vermont, different than Gertz and in fact different than many states, has a specific constitutional provision that protects the reputation of its citizenry.</text>
            <text syncTime="3323.214" offset="13443325">Our constitution specifically says that the character of our citizens has special protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3329.968" offset="13470388">So I think the key to this case here is to say, does a constitutional interest apply?</text>

            <text syncTime="3576.459" offset="14456353">They focused on the entire gamut of conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.344" offset="14471922">It wasn't really looking at the speaker and saying that speech is bad and we're going to punish it by way of punitive damages.</text>
            <text syncTime="3589.034" offset="14506613">It really looked at the entire course of conduct under traditional common law rules.</text>
            <text syncTime="3597.623" offset="14540990">One thing that I'd like to point out finally is that, let's suppose, to follow up on your point, Your Honor, that Dun &amp; Bradstreet got the same protection that Robert Welch, Incorporated, got.</text>
            <text syncTime="3616.603" offset="14616954">Under this trial what would happen is that constitutional protection for actual damages would apply because of Gertz, and then the constitutional damages for punitive damages under New York Times would apply.</text>
            <text syncTime="3635.648" offset="14693127">But in addition to that, not only would the plaintiff, but Dun &amp; Bradstreet would look for the common law punitive damage charge just to get to the question of any compensatory damage, and then common law malice to think about and focus upon the other activity that this defendant engaged in.</text>
            <text syncTime="3656.844" offset="14777869">So you would have four separate things for the jury to handle.</text>
            <text syncTime="3661.565" offset="14796781">I think that would just hopelessly confuse a jury.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.682" offset="14805245">There's been a lot of commentary about the difficulty between actual malice and common law malice and constitutional malice, and essentially what they're asking the Court to do is to have a trial where there are those four instructions.</text>

            <text syncTime="3743.536" offset="15124670">My final point is this.</text>
            <text syncTime="3745.419" offset="15132193">I mentioned earlier that if this case is extended, if Gertz is extended to this type of a defendant, what we will have is the total constitutionalization of the state laws of libel.</text>
            <text syncTime="3762.263" offset="15199589">And I think we really have to ask ourselves whether that's appropriate policy.</text>
            <text syncTime="3767.231" offset="15219442">Now, we have made accommodations as a society to the reputation of our citizens for the benefit of strong First Amendment protections.</text>
            <text syncTime="3776.170" offset="15255178">But if Gertz applies here, I'd suggest to the Court it will mean that reputation is so cheap and so unvalued in our society that it can be destroyed by the local gossip monger or by a huge company that pays an untrained high schooler $200 a year to perform a task she was never trained to do.</text>
            <text syncTime="3798.901" offset="15346084">If private reputation can be so easily damaged, then we have to ask the other question: What benefit is there to a good reputation?</text>
            <text syncTime="3809.224" offset="15387358">I think the Court will have to question what such a result will do to the positive normative benefits that reputation contributes to our society, and at the same time consider what it will do to the goal that the framers had in mind for the First Amendment if over-the-fence rumor and idle gossip at the water cooler receives constitutional protection.</text>
            <text syncTime="3835.792" offset="15493624">Every constitutional... every libel case in the country will have the Gertz standard if Dun &amp; Bradstreet is correct in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3845.314" offset="15531762">I think enough speech has been protected under the New York Times formula where you look at the plaintiff and enough speech has been protected when you look at media defendants.</text>
