            <label>Mr. Richard N. League</label>
            <text syncTime="40.625" offset="312965">Thank you.</text>
            <text syncTime="42.160" offset="319025">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="43.743" offset="325399">This case is presenting the issue of whether or not cause is sufficient grounds to excuse the procedural default in the context of a habeas corpus proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="54.385" offset="367926">Our position is that in this particular case it isn't.</text>
            <text syncTime="58.837" offset="385794">Briefly, the facts of this case are that Daniel Ross in 1969 was convicted in Wake County, North Carolina of first degree murder in a trial that he put on evidence of self-defense in.</text>
            <text syncTime="72.362" offset="439920">The instructions of the trial judge gave the state the benefit of a presumption of unlawfulness and malice because a deadly weapon was used, and also put the burden of proof in one of two contexts on Mr. Ross to negate self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="91.926" offset="518183">Mr. Ross appealed his case.</text>
            <text syncTime="95.562" offset="532707">He did not assign this error, the instructions in this regard, and that is where we urge that the procedural default comes in, at that time and under present day law as well, although it's now changed in terms of the particular statute.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.554" offset="596654">North Carolina required an issue that could be raised on appeal to be so raised.</text>
            <text syncTime="117.458" offset="620269">It could not be raised if it were a matter of record on post-conviction review after the appeal under ordinary circumstances.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.731" offset="649317">We have an initial problem in this case as to whether we do have a forfeiture because of some language in the North Carolina Supreme Court's decision on the matter, and I'll address that first.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.122" offset="694875">And the language they used was this: that the burden of proof was properly allocated in the case.</text>
            <text syncTime="142.693" offset="721206">That was used, however, not in the context of an issue being raised about this matter, but it was made as a part of a discussion that... whether or not... on whether or not it was proper for the court not to have charged on the offense of involuntary manslaughter.</text>
            <text syncTime="162.237" offset="799365">There's a reference in the instructions on down the line that the court... or pardon me... in the opinion on down the line that the court was waiving its rule with regard to assignments of error to parts of the charge.</text>
            <text syncTime="177.782" offset="861536">However, this, too, was made in the context of referring to the matter, whether or not the instruction on involuntary manslaughter was properly not given.</text>
            <text syncTime="189.089" offset="906780">It was not made in connection with the reference to the burden of proof some paragraph and a half, two paragraphs above that.</text>
            <text syncTime="197.593" offset="940844">On thing that's occurred to me with regard to this matter that might provide the Court some assistance in determining whether this rather cursory reference should amount to a waiver of the state's forfeiture rule is something that comes out of exhaustion law.</text>
            <text syncTime="215.289" offset="1011583">And when an issue is presented in a state court, a fact situation is presented in a state court on the basis of one legal theory, that's not viewed as an exhaustion of a... of a separate legal theory.</text>
            <text syncTime="229.898" offset="1069993">Therefore, to the extent this Court may feel that the North Carolina Supreme Court to some extent waived its procedural default rule, I would argue that the most they were looking for... and it was on their own initiative... would be somewhat of a plain error approach; that it was not a complete waiver of the state's forfeiture rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="251.580" offset="1156720">At most it would be sort of a pro tanto type thing.</text>
            <text syncTime="254.199" offset="1167273">And the interest in comity that the courts recognized underline the recognition of procedural defaults over in the habeas corpus proceeding ought to apply to the same extent that the state court recognized and followed its own rule, and that would be the large extent in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="272.660" offset="1241043">At the post-conviction level there's an additional problem as well, unfortunately, and that stems from the judge at the Superior Court level saying in rejecting the man's post-conviction proceeding or petition that no grounds for relief were stated.</text>
            <text syncTime="293.991" offset="1326411">Then he goes on to say that under the Post-Conviction Relief Act... and I argue to you that that certainly is most likely construed as a procedural waiver, particularly in the context in which it was said... after recitation of the man's efforts, including his appeal and his lack of success there.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.552" offset="1408645">There wasn't any... any reference to a substance obviation, whether it was right or wrong.</text>
            <text syncTime="321.039" offset="1434558">We've suggested to the Court in our brief the Hayes case from Alabama, U.S. District Court case, provides a good basis for approaching this.</text>
            <text syncTime="332.145" offset="1478966">And the points they make or that are made by the court in that case... the fact that there's a well-established body of procedural default rule that would... procedural default law that would apply here; and the fact that it would be correctly applied here as shown by a number of cases we cite on page 12 in the footnote to our brief; the fact that the state pled forfeiture, as it did at its first opportunity... that would be at the appeal level.</text>
            <text syncTime="365.866" offset="1613863">Now, in state post-conviction proceedings in North Carolina, often an answer is not required from the District Attorney's Office, and that was the case here.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.007" offset="1658480">The adjudication is made just from a survey of the writ itself or the petition itself initially.</text>
            <text syncTime="384.994" offset="1690454">It's only if some concern is raised by it to the reviewing court that they will go ahead and call for an answer from the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="393.533" offset="1724517">The other consideration noted in the Hayes case... that the decision on this basis would favor the interest in avoiding constitutional questions... would also apply here as well.</text>
            <text syncTime="410.561" offset="1792645">North Carolina has such a preference of avoiding such questions if they can.</text>
            <text syncTime="415.882" offset="1813961">Mr. Nakell has argued to you throughout his brief that the perhaps the state ground relied on was inadequate here because of certain cases and the resolution of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="429.606" offset="1868818">He cites a Hankerson case and a Hancock case as examples where Mullaney-type issues were allowed to be raised on direct appeal despite the fact that no assignment of error was made with regard to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="445.715" offset="1933288">That is true, but nevertheless, the case was still on direct appeal, and therefore, the State Supreme Court had the opportunity to correct any error at the point in the proceedings that they wanted to do so, that it was most efficient to do so and that they felt it was proper to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="463.660" offset="2005072">It's not an after-the-fact thing such as this man's case is.</text>
            <text syncTime="468.231" offset="2023358">There's reference to the case Wynn v. Mahoney, but the conduct there--</text>

            <text syncTime="585.705" offset="2493249">I don't.</text>
            <text syncTime="586.138" offset="2495025">The Wynn case, which Mr. Nakell relied on, dealt with my conduct and not pleading forfeiture in a particular case rather than the State Supreme Court's reaction to such an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="601.282" offset="2555525">And I don't think I have the power to make an otherwise adequate state rule inadequate.</text>
            <text syncTime="608.053" offset="2582692">There are two new... new developments in the law: the recent case of State v. Bush, interpreting our... or brought under our later post-conviction statute, the one that superseded the former one, I believe in 1978.</text>
            <text syncTime="625.397" offset="2651969">In that case the State Supreme Court did review the issue on the merits in order to propound the law they did.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.669" offset="2689063">They did not rely on procedural default in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="637.036" offset="2698571">What kind of harbinger for the future I can't say to you.</text>
            <text syncTime="641.573" offset="2716752">If it continues, of course, and it's repeated, you would not find the state ground I'm relying on adequate on down the line.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.528" offset="2752592">However, Mr. Ross would probably get the benefit of any change in that regard.</text>
            <text syncTime="655.499" offset="2772445">15A-1419, a new post-conviction relief statute, now called Motion for Appropriate Relief in our jurisdiction, references retroactive decisions as a basis for reopening a prior post-conviction proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="673.044" offset="2842558">However, that's only in the instance that the issue is ruled on on the merits in the prior proceeding.</text>
            <text syncTime="679.032" offset="2866591">It's not a situation such as I have argued to you that we have here; that is, where a decision was made on procedural grounds.</text>
            <text syncTime="688.470" offset="2904312">Mr. Nakell filed a number of cases last week with you-all in support of this position, as I understand it, and I think it's important to consider there that what the Supreme Court was doing was waiving its procedural defaults again in the direct appeal context where the court had an opportunity to deal with the issues presented at that time, and not waiving them in a post-conviction context.</text>
            <text syncTime="715.288" offset="3011623">Additionally, the rules involved there are rules that are somewhat dissimilar, not applicable to this fact situation that we're dealing with here.</text>
            <text syncTime="728.028" offset="3062509">One dealt with the assignments of error being properly constructed primarily or referenced in the brief or having the exceptions set out with regard to them.</text>
            <text syncTime="738.320" offset="3103678">Again, that's not a situation that we're concerned with here, because the issue again was not presented in Petitioners' case on direct as it was in each of these.</text>
            <text syncTime="751.144" offset="3154983">Similarly, it's not a... there's no request by the lawyer after giving up all its assignments at error, asking the court to conduct such of a plain error review.</text>
            <text syncTime="762.686" offset="3201167">I would say in most of the other cases Mr. Nakell--</text>

            <label>Mr. Edwin S. Kneedler</label>
            <text syncTime="1354.649" offset="5569010">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.451" offset="5584266">I would like to pick up on the novelty question that was just beginning to be addressed here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1364.504" offset="5608403">In the Court's decision in Hankerson applying the Mullaney decision retroactively, the Court noted that in many cases the defendants might well not have raised the particular objection involved there, and that the courts... or that the states may well be able to protect those convictions from collateral attack or other attack by enforcing what the court referred to as the normal and valid rule under which a claim is foregone if there is not an objection, contemporaneous objection to the rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="1398.094" offset="5742777">And in Engle v. Isaac the Court addressed an aspect of that question.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.747" offset="5765451">There had been no objection raised to the instruction in Engle v. Isaac.</text>
            <text syncTime="1409.299" offset="5787603">This was prior to the Hankerson decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="1412.687" offset="5801187">And a claim was made that under prevailing law at the time it would have been futile to raise such an objection, and the Court emphatically rejected that suggestion that futility, perceived futility in the state court was... would be an adequate ground or cause for forgiving the procedural default in the state court.</text>
            <text syncTime="1434.267" offset="5887495">And the Court also noted that the allegation that the claim was novel was not sufficient in that particular case because the defendants there had been tried after this Court's decision In re Winship, which held that the due process clause requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt in criminal cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1456.264" offset="5975476">The effect of the Court's ruling there was to limit or to prohibit, in effect, the retroactive application of Mullaney to the most recent cases to that decision, those in the later years; but it reserved the question of whether a claim that was truly novel, one that would have required extraordinary vision, would constitute cause for excusing the procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1488.033" offset="6102535">Now, if this Court were to adopt that position, it would have the ironic effect not of preserving convictions that were most recent at a time when the rule itself was being questioned and yet setting aside convictions that were the oldest at a time when, by hypothesis, the right was not recognized and that the trial procedure was uniformly recognized as being fair.</text>
            <text syncTime="1514.184" offset="6207130">The Court recognized in Engle v. Issac that the purpose of habeas corpus is to set aside a conviction where there is fundamentally unfair incarceration.</text>
            <text syncTime="1525.159" offset="6251015">And we would submit that if in Engle v. Isaac where the issue is beginning to be litigated there was not fundamentally unfair incarceration, then it follows a fortiori here that there was not, if the suggestion is that the claim is not novel.</text>
            <text syncTime="1542.120" offset="6318934">But, in fact, the claim could hardly be described as novel in the years prior to In re Winship.</text>
            <text syncTime="1550.290" offset="6351639">In In re Winship itself, the issue in the New York Court of Appeals was not the rule of proof beyond a reasonable doubt in a criminal prosecution: the rule was simply... the question was simply whether that rule should apply in juvenile proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1564.034" offset="6406601">And this Court's... this Court's decision in Patterson stated that long before In re Winship, the universal rule in this country was that the prosecution bears the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="1576.257" offset="6455502">In fact, in 1968 before this Court's decision in Winship and before the Respondent's trial in this case, this Court had granted certiorari in Johnson v. Bennett and heard argument on the question of whether imposing the burden of proof on the defendant for an alibi defense violated due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1596.838" offset="6537735">And the Court remanded for further proceedings on the basis of an en banc decision of the Eighth Circuit, also before Respondent's trial in this case, that struck down a similar instruction under the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="1611.114" offset="6594891">And the Eighth Circuit had regarded the presumption of innocence and the corresponding rule of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to be so well established that there was no real question of retroactivity in that case at all.</text>
            <text syncTime="1623.005" offset="6642434">And finally, there were a substantial body of state law at the time, as Mr. Justice White identified, under which the burden of proof on malice and self-defense was on the prosecution rather than on the defendant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1644.918" offset="6730101">While those cases do not arise under the due process clause, they do recognize a recognition of the burden of proof issue as being an aspect of the fairness of the proceedings.</text>
            <text syncTime="1657.309" offset="6779629">Indeed, that's the rationale in the decisions for imposing the burden on the defense in those cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="1663.296" offset="6803662">So, in fact, at the time of Respondent's trial, and as the Court said in Patterson long before that, the notion of proof beyond a reasonable doubt was a fundamental aspect of due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="1678.223" offset="6863325">Now, even if the Court... even if the right here, though, could be recognized or thought to be truly novel, as I said, we submit that that would not be cause for excusing the procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1695.601" offset="6932811">Now, first of all, in this case there's no indication that in fact that was the reason why no objection was lodged.</text>
            <text syncTime="1703.540" offset="6964576">There was also no indication to that effect in Engle itself.</text>
            <text syncTime="1711.211" offset="6995296">Now, if the attorney had focused on the question of the burden of proof under the due process clause and decided not to raise it, because, by hypothesis, no one had recognized a due process violation here, then the lawyer's judgment in that regard could not be questioned under an ineffective assistance of counsel rationale; and, in fact, Respondent doesn't suggest as much.</text>
            <text syncTime="1732.309" offset="7079619">So that if the lawyer had actually focused on it, it would have been a tactical judgment that this is one of the objections that's not worth making in a trial that requires many objections.</text>
            <text syncTime="1742.665" offset="7121102">That would be a tactical judgment which Respondent concedes would not constitute cause for excusing the procedural default.</text>
            <text syncTime="1751.085" offset="7154747">So Respondent then is reduced to arguing with the fact that the lawyer didn't think of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="1757.223" offset="7179303">Even though if he had thought of it, it wouldn't have been cause, the fact that the lawyer didn't think of it must constitute cause because the right was novel.</text>

            <text syncTime="1960.486" offset="7992338">And so even... even if that was thought to be a separate category of cases, that's not this case, because here the principals involved here are an elaboration of the proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard, both with respect to self-defense and with respect to malice.</text>
            <text syncTime="1978.197" offset="8063182">Because in this particular case, under North Carolina law those are deemed to go to elements of the offense rather than to be, strictly speaking, affirmative defenses.</text>

            <text syncTime="1995.373" offset="8131936">As the debate in the brief suggests, it can require an exhaustive review of state law, federal law, law review articles, this Court's decisions... all to the point of seeing when the first time a particular right was identified as being raised.</text>

            <text syncTime="2088.835" offset="8505801">And I think that Engle is different from this case in at least three respects.</text>
            <text syncTime="2095.404" offset="8532027">First, as Justice Stevens' questions have pointed out, the procedural failure in this case involved a failure on appeal, and not a failure at trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2104.776" offset="8569539">Secondly, the North Carolina courts are lenient in their treatment of procedural failures on appeal, regularly suspending their rules and overlooking the default in order to reach the merits, as they did in Ross' case both on appeal and on his post-conviction petition, and as they did in several other cases raising the same Mullaney issue.</text>

            <text syncTime="2134.112" offset="8686881">That's correct, Your Honor.</text>
            <text syncTime="2135.362" offset="8691897">The district court considered the argument and held that the North Carolina Supreme Court had not in fact reviewed the issue, quoting only one part of the North Carolina Supreme Court's decision addressing this point.</text>
            <text syncTime="2150.139" offset="8751038">The North Carolina... the Fourth Circuit then said that the argument is not without force, but did not reach the issue; and so there is no decision of the Fourth Circuit on this issue, that's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2162.930" offset="8802134">I might point out that in the list of cases that I submitted belatedly, which I would like to rely on... these are later cases in which the North Carolina courts have relied on a new rule explicitly giving the court the authority that it already had to suspend the rules... in many of those cases when the North Carolina Supreme Court and court of appeals did suspend the rules, they explained that they were doing so in the criminal context because of the severity of the offense and the severity of the punishment.</text>
            <text syncTime="2197.234" offset="8939329">And in all of those cases the offense was murder, and the punishment was life imprisonment.</text>

            <text syncTime="2228.122" offset="9062940">Well, Your Honor, I would not doubt that that is one option available to the Court, and I would certainly think that it's a mandatory option if the Court were to rule against me on the other issues, which I hope it would not do.</text>
            <text syncTime="2241.263" offset="9115499">The Court would either have to decide the issue or remand it to the Fourth Circuit where it would still be open.</text>
            <text syncTime="2247.934" offset="9142143">Incidentally, for reasons I don't know, the Fourth Circuit did not address the argument that the North Carolina courts had overlooked this failure in these other series of cases.</text>
            <text syncTime="2260.677" offset="9193134">And I might say in that respect that it seems to me that this case is before this Court in the identical posture of Hankerson.</text>
            <text syncTime="2268.163" offset="9223123">If there is any difference, it's more favorable to this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2272.401" offset="9240050">But in Hankerson, Hankerson did not raise the Mullaney issue on appeal, did not raise it in the record on appeal as was required.</text>
            <text syncTime="2281.507" offset="9276413">Indeed, it wasn't until sometime after this Court decided Mullaney that Hankerson moved to reopen his appeal and add an issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2292.815" offset="9321657">That is... that... he had the opportunity to do that because his case was still pending at the time that this Court decided Mullaney.</text>
            <text syncTime="2301.235" offset="9355407">But his... in that case, the North Carolina Supreme Court then overlooked the procedural failure, granted the motion and reached the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2309.324" offset="9387694">Exactly the same was true in Daniel Ross' case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2312.442" offset="9400233">The only difference is that in Daniel Ross' case, Mullaney hadn't been decided, indeed Winship hadn't been decided, and certainly the North Carolina Supreme Court did not address those points.</text>
            <text syncTime="2324.267" offset="9447463">And I think that that difference does not matter because the argument is... the point is not whether the North Carolina Supreme Court considered the precise argument, but whether it insisted on a forfeiture to enforce its procedural rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="2340.962" offset="9514232">And since the North Carolina Supreme Court excused the failure to raise the issue, that's all that need concern the federal courts.</text>
            <text syncTime="2348.365" offset="9543907">If the state courts do not insist on enforcement of their procedural rules by a forfeiture, then the federal courts show no disrespect for the state court procedures by continuing to consider the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2361.709" offset="9597301">The third respect in which the present case differs from Engle against Isaac is that for Daniel Ross at the time of his appeal, the Mullaney issue was not yet reasonably available.</text>
            <text syncTime="2383.206" offset="9683296">The foundation principle had not yet been decided, and no counsel or court, certainly not in North Carolina, and indeed, no place in the country, had perceived or begun to litigate the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="2394.013" offset="9726450">As this Court said... expressed the test in footnote 41 of Engle, the issue was not yet a live issue at the time of Mr. Ross' trial and appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2408.523" offset="9784547">Accordingly, it was reasonable for Ross and his attorney to fail to raise it; or as North Carolina stated the position in its brief in this Court in Hankerson, Ross</text>
            <text syncTime="2421.498" offset="9836374">"quite properly took no exception thereto. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2425.366" offset="9851943">The state relies on the guilty plea cases in its brief... McMahan against Richardson and Pollad against Henderson... and that line of cases is entirely inapposite.</text>
            <text syncTime="2439.309" offset="9907636">Ross did not plead guilty.</text>
            <text syncTime="2442.411" offset="9920070">Ross did not give up any of his defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2446.315" offset="9935743">He did not give up any of his rights... present, prospective or potential... either absolutely or in exchange for any benefit or leniency.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.854" offset="9981823">He insisted on his innocence, and he pursued respectively all of the state procedures as best he could at the time.</text>
            <text syncTime="2465.777" offset="10013588">He went to trial, he appealed, and when later this Court decided Mullaney and then decided that it applied to his trial in Hankerson, he didn't run to the federal courts right away.</text>
            <text syncTime="2478.084" offset="10062803">Instead, he filed a post-conviction petition in the... in the state courts, although without benefit of counsel.</text>
            <text syncTime="2486.190" offset="10095195">And only after he was unsuccessful there did he seek relief by way of federal habeas corpus.</text>
            <text syncTime="2493.896" offset="10126019">So his only failure was the failure to raise the issue on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="2499.450" offset="10148276">And why didn't he raise the issue?</text>
            <text syncTime="2502.083" offset="10158725">Only because under the state of the law at the time, it was essentially unavailable to him because his attorney did not, quoting Engle, 1952; that is, to raise an issue challenging the placing of the burden of proof on a defendant with regard to an affirmative defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2534.873" offset="10289964">What was the state of the law at the time that Mr. Ross--</text>

            <text syncTime="2660.470" offset="10792351">That's correct.</text>
            <text syncTime="2662.036" offset="10798620">In... in Patterson against New York in 1977, in summing up in reviewing the course of the law earlier, this Court did say, as the Solicitor General represented, that it had long been assumed that the burden of proof was constitutionally required to be put on the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2686.387" offset="10896005">But in Patterson the Court also pointed out that it had been</text>
            <text syncTime="2690.772" offset="10913559">"the long accepted rule that it was constitutionally permissible to provide that various defenses were to be proved by the defendant. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2700.378" offset="10951907">The Court recognized in Patterson that that had been the long accepted rule, notwithstanding the general assumption that the burden of proof generally had to be put on the prosecution.</text>
            <text syncTime="2713.954" offset="11006241">And that long accepted rule with regard to affirmative defenses was certainly supported, or the Court's statement about it, in Patterson, was certainly supported by the decision in Leland against Oregon back in 1952 in which this Court upheld placing the burden of proof on the defendant with regard to the insanity defense... not only the burden of proof and not only beyond a preponderance... by a preponderance of the evidence, but indeed, the burden of proof in Leland against Oregon on the defendant was beyond a reasonable doubt, and the Court upheld that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2754.947" offset="11170186">The Court rejected the line of cases, including Todd against United States, dealing with presumptions and the constitutionality of presumptions that could have been raised, and said they had no bearing at all in this respect.</text>
            <text syncTime="2770.791" offset="11233611">No wonder Leland against Oregon seemed to settle the law, and after Leland against Oregon, nobody started to raise the issue again until after Winship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2783.301" offset="11283662">Indeed, the only cases raising--</text>

            <text syncTime="2786.336" offset="11295783">Well, how did it get raised in Winship if it was so foreclosed?</text>

            <label>Mr. Barry Nakell</label>
            <text syncTime="2790.788" offset="11313546">--Well, Winship was an unusual case, Your Honor, in which the trial judge in a juvenile proceeding said that he would... he found the defendant guilty by a preponderance of the evidence, but not if the test were beyond a reasonable doubt.</text>
            <text syncTime="2807.499" offset="11380419">The issue then came up in that pure form.</text>
            <text syncTime="2810.534" offset="11392540">Now, at that time there had been the decisions that the Court discussed in its footnote 39 in Engle, the decisions in Stump against Bennett primarily, and also State against Nales.</text>
            <text syncTime="2826.544" offset="11456592">Both of these decisions involved the question of the burden of proof on the elements of the offense, not affirmative defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2835.900" offset="11494000">And indeed, Stump, in Stump, the Eighth Circuit distinguished Leland against Oregon expressly on that basis; that an affirmative defense was not involved in that case.</text>
            <text syncTime="2849.426" offset="11548125">But even as to this issue, even as to the burden of proof on the elements of the offense, that same case, Stump, came before this Court five years earlier on a petition for certiorari, and this Court denied that petition in 1963, even with regard to an element of the offense.</text>
            <text syncTime="2869.740" offset="11629419">And, of course, that has no precedential effect, but it wasn't until 1968 that the courts were even considering the issue of the burden of proof being placed on the defendant with regard to the elements of the offense, the basic elements; and that was just shortly before Ross' trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="2893.705" offset="11725236">And Winship was decided after Ross' trial, and it was after Winship that all the activity started.</text>
            <text syncTime="2902.128" offset="11758986">And not even right away then.</text>
            <text syncTime="2903.811" offset="11765673">It took a little while after Winship for attorneys to start thinking about the impact of that on affirmative defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2912.317" offset="11799737">And the activity got underway at that time, but not until after Winship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2918.653" offset="11825023">No place in the country, no attorney, no court, and certainly not in North Carolina, and certainly not the North Carolina courts considered the impact of Winship on the burden of proof for affirmative defenses.</text>
            <text syncTime="2933.230" offset="11883329">Indeed, even just before and just after Ross' trial and appeal, and even a couple of years later, the North Carolina Supreme Court was still routinely reiterating the general burden of proof rule with regard to affirmative defenses, these two affirmative defenses; and that is that the burden of proof was on the defendant, without any consideration that there was even a constitutional question about it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2961.666" offset="11997118">Mullaney was not decided until five years later, and in Mullaney, in Patterson against New York, in Jackson against Virginia, and in Ivan V. against New York, this Court said in all of those cases that it all began with Winship.</text>
            <text syncTime="2980.211" offset="12071306">Engle, of course, involved trials that occurred... two were just before Mullaney, but while Mullaney was pending in this Court, and one occurred after the Mullaney decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="2993.138" offset="12123028">At that time, as the Court noted, dozens of lawyers had begun to raise the issue as to affirmative defenses, including the affirmative defense of self-defense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3005.445" offset="12172243">There were law review comments that said that Mullaney had an impact on this issue, and indeed, even the state law had been changed to impose the burden of proof in that way.</text>
            <text syncTime="3017.419" offset="12220099">That's a very different situation than prevailed in 1969 at the time of Ross' appeal, and certainly a very different situation than that which prevailed in North Carolina.</text>
            <text syncTime="3034.648" offset="12289063">Indeed, the... the Solicitor General... excuse me... the Attorney General of North Carolina in his brief in this Court in the Hankerson case advised this Court that there was no reason for anybody to anticipate that there was any constitutional problem with the putting of the burden of proof on the defendant as to affirmative defenses until after Mullaney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3063.917" offset="12406091">And the North Carolina Supreme Court in its opinion in Hankerson said that it was only Mullaney that cast any question on the state's rule.</text>
            <text syncTime="3072.590" offset="12440782">So that's why Ross and his attorney did not even consider raising the issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3079.326" offset="12467740">There was no strategy decision involved, no tactical decision.</text>
            <text syncTime="3084.028" offset="12486548">This was an understandable and excusable failure to anticipate the new development.</text>
            <text syncTime="3093.151" offset="12523015">The Solicitor General has argued that... that even this circumstance may not constitute cause under the Wainwright cause and prejudice test.</text>
            <text syncTime="3109.113" offset="12586859">But that can't be the case, especially when the failure arises under the circumstances here... on appeal rather than at trial, regarding a rule that the state courts regularly decline to enforce with a forfeiture, and concerning an issue that affects the reliability of the verdict.</text>
            <text syncTime="3129.259" offset="12667420">The Solicitor General cites absolutely no authority in support of that proposition, and all the authority is unanimously to the contrary, including the decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3142.584" offset="12720814">In Engle the Court suggested that the unavailability of an issue might constitute cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3150.006" offset="12750490">Certainly in O'Connor against Ohio the Court held precisely to that effect in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="3157.927" offset="12782150">O'Connor did not arise under the cause and prejudice standard, but it certainly showed this Court's opinion with regard to the issues of fairness involved in allowing a defendant the benefit of a retroactively applicable rule that he failed to raise only because it had not yet been decided and was not yet reasonably available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3187.096" offset="12898865">There are many other cases to this effect from this Court which are cited on page 17 of my brief, including, I think, Fay against Noia, which demonstrates the way that this Court approached that issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3203.474" offset="12964276">Fay against Noia was really a case in which the defendant declined to appeal because of the failure of his counsel to be able to anticipate the later decisions of this Court.</text>
            <text syncTime="3215.782" offset="13013595">He said that he didn't appeal because he didn't want to put his family to the expense.</text>
            <text syncTime="3220.936" offset="13034179">And later, at about the same time as it decided Fay against Noia, this Court held in Douglas against California that because he was indigent, he would have been entitled to have the defense provided by the... on appeal as well as at trial by the state.</text>
            <text syncTime="3237.112" offset="13098859">His attorney testified that he was afraid of getting the death penalty on retrial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3244.217" offset="13127280">Years later, this Court held in North Carolina against Pearce that he essentially could not have been given an increased sentence on retrial unless there were some justification for it in terms of his conduct since the original trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3259.811" offset="13189660">So Fay against Noia is a case in which the Court recognized the fairness principle involved here.</text>
            <text syncTime="3269.167" offset="13227067">All other courts that have considered the issue have held that this is a paradigm example of cause, including the Norris case in the Seventh Circuit which the Solicitor General cited with special approval.</text>
            <text syncTime="3285.811" offset="13293627">All the law reviews, the analogy to Federal Rule 9, 9A and 9B, in which the unavailability of a decision that is later announced is established as cause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3305.006" offset="13370427">And finally, the legislation that the Reagan Administration has proposed and which passed the Senate on February 6th of this year is directly contrary to the position the Solicitor General has taken in this case and directly supportive of Ross' position.</text>
            <text syncTime="3324.686" offset="13449213">This case involves no failure at trial, but only a failure on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3333.709" offset="13485262">And this Court in Wainwright against Sykes expressly recognized the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3340.363" offset="13511907">Indeed, Wainwright against Sykes was based on the difference.</text>
            <text syncTime="3344.417" offset="13528103">The Court in Davis against United States when it began to develop the cause and prejudice test specifically distinguished a failure to raise an issue at trial from a failure to raise an issue on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3359.510" offset="13588498">And in footnote 8 in Hankerson, the dictum that suggested that the states could enforce an ordinary rule that failure to object to a jury instruction is a waiver certainly refers to a trial failure.</text>
            <text syncTime="3378.738" offset="13665402">Objecting to an instruction is language appropriate to the trial context.</text>
            <text syncTime="3384.542" offset="13688599">And, indeed, North Carolina read it that way in its answer in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="3391.731" offset="13717334">With regard to the issue of raising an issue on appeal--</text>

            <label>Mr. Barry Nakell</label>
            <text syncTime="3413.727" offset="13805314">--Your Honor, there certainly are some policies supporting a rule requiring an issue to be raised on appeal, and comity considerations suggest that a federal court should treat respectfully state rules in that regard, requiring issues to be raised on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3430.356" offset="13871874">My point is simply that those... that that's the only policy that supports it, and all of the other policy reasons that the Court relied on in Wainwright against Sykes with regard to a contemporaneous objection rule at trial just don't apply on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3444.597" offset="13928821">Moreover, there are good reasons for not requiring... not requiring defendants to raise an issue on appeal in order to have it available on federal habeas corpus, at least where the issue has not yet been decided.</text>
            <text syncTime="3460.689" offset="13993187">And the most obvious is the one that the Court alluded to in Engle, and the institutional reason that attorneys, if we... if the court does apply Wainwright against Sykes to appeals and not excuse the failure where the issue is unavailable, attorneys will feel obligated on every appeal to raise every conceivable issue, even those that seem settled, as in 1969 as a result of Leland against Oregon, this issue seemed settled.</text>
            <text syncTime="3486.757" offset="14097467">And in Jones against Barnes this Court counseled against that kind of advocacy on appeal and recognized the importance of the attorney being selective in the issues that are presented on appeal.</text>
            <text syncTime="3504.718" offset="14169252">Certainly I agree with that.</text>
            <text syncTime="3508.437" offset="14184194">And I think that if Wainwright against Sykes is applied, the cause and prejudice test is applied to appeal, and there's no leeway for issues that are unavailable, attorneys will have to raise every issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="3522.613" offset="14240932">For example, in every jurisdiction that doesn't have a grand jury procedure, or in every jurisdiction that has such a procedure but has the preliminary hearing as an alternative, I think every defendant who appeals will have to argue from now on that the Fifth Amendment requirement of indictment by grand jury applies to the states through the due process clause.</text>
            <text syncTime="3548.497" offset="14344377">In 1884 this Court seemed to settle that issue in Ertado against California, but the fact that it's been settled would not be a justification for a defendant to raise the issue if the Court rules the way the Solicitor General has suggested.</text>
            <text syncTime="3563.607" offset="14404876">So that that's one issue, and I think that we could easily think of about 200 issues that would be part of boilerplate in every appeal just to make sure it's not waived.</text>
            <text syncTime="3575.832" offset="14453778">What policy is served by requiring a procedure like that?</text>
            <text syncTime="3580.468" offset="14472272">If, indeed... if Ross' attorney had been thinking about this issue in 1969 and had tried to raise it, he could not have done so in much other than boilerplate fashion.</text>
            <text syncTime="3594.459" offset="14528279">He could just have said the instruction violates due process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3598.847" offset="14545833">He couldn't have cited Winship.</text>
            <text syncTime="3600.930" offset="14554192">It wasn't available.</text>
            <text syncTime="3602.382" offset="14559939">He couldn't have cited Mullaney.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.001" offset="14566418">It was years in the offing.</text>
            <text syncTime="3606.417" offset="14576135">And he would have had Leland against Oregon to contend with.</text>
            <text syncTime="3611.821" offset="14597765">So that there would be, if the Court were to accept the Solicitor General's argument, there would be an obligation on the part of attorneys to raise all of these issues no matter how settled they appear to be.</text>
            <text syncTime="3625.878" offset="14653980">And that's one reason I think that the issue of an appeal is different from a trial.</text>
            <text syncTime="3632.032" offset="14678535">It's easier to raise these issues at trial than it is to clutter an appeal with raising all of these issues.</text>
            <text syncTime="3639.971" offset="14710300">Trials are accustomed and in part designed to receive a large number of defenses, to receive a large number of issues of varying degrees of import.</text>

            <text syncTime="3891.468" offset="15716328">Let me respond to that with two points, if I might.</text>
            <text syncTime="3894.420" offset="15728135">The first is that in determining the retroactivity of an issue, the first question that the Court focuses on is whether the issue is one that goes to the fairness of the factfinding process.</text>
            <text syncTime="3906.977" offset="15778290">If the Court were to find that the new rule should apply retroactively... and I note that the Court has decided exactly the contrary in Leland, approved in Patterson against New York... that if the Court were to find that that was such an unconstitutional rule that affected the fairness of the factfinding process, I would think so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3929.693" offset="15869196">With regard to the number of cases, let me point out that the rule that I'm requesting in this case, that Ross is requesting, would not really affect many cases.</text>
