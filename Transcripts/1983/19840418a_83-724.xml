            <text syncTime="0.000" offset="151240">We will hear arguments next in Roberts against the United States Jaycees.</text>
            <text syncTime="13.651" offset="205784">Mr. Varco, I think you may proceed whenever you're ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Richard L. Varco, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="71.690" offset="437960">Mr. Chief Justice and may it please the Court, at issue today are two conflicting claims.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.625" offset="465650">On one hand, the states, that it can prohibit sex discrimination in certain commercial associations, and on the other, the United States Jaycees, with a constitutionally protected freedom of association, permits it to engage in precisely that conduct.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.603" offset="525627">In order to understand those claims, it's necessary that the facts of this case be made clear, and I'd like to take a few minutes to do just that.</text>
            <text syncTime="103.037" offset="563348">What the Jaycees does, and what it offers, and how it treats its members are essential to an understanding of this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="111.175" offset="595844">What the organization does is offer leadership training and leadership skills and the opportunity to obtain those skills and obtain that training to certain individuals.</text>
            <text syncTime="121.468" offset="637013">It offers this training and these opportunities in three types of programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="127.121" offset="659687">The first type of program is the program in which the Jaycees train an individual to better himself or herself.</text>
            <text syncTime="133.556" offset="685392">Such programs would be learning how to be a better speaker.</text>
            <text syncTime="137.368" offset="700647">A second type of program is a program that they call management skills.</text>
            <text syncTime="141.865" offset="718620">That indicates that the Jaycees train people to run meetings, to run programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="149.988" offset="751116">A third type of program that the Jaycees runs and provides opportunities for leadership training in are programs which merge those first two types of skills, but which work toward the betterment of the community, so that, for example, an individual Jaycee learns these individual skills, learns how to run a program, and then runs a program for the betterment of their community.</text>
            <text syncTime="172.009" offset="839201">These programs are made available through some 7,000 local chapters by a national organization, and they're run on a local basis in local communities.</text>
            <text syncTime="182.521" offset="881310">The unfortunate part, from the State's point point of view, about these programs is that women have admission to the leadership training opportunities that are provided, but they're on a limited basis.</text>
            <text syncTime="193.579" offset="925509">What women cannot do in these organizations is that they cannot vote, they cannot hold office, and they cannot receive any of the awards that the Jaycees give for performance in these programs.</text>
            <text syncTime="204.434" offset="968873">Thus, what happens is the Jaycees can buy part of this program... female Jaycees can buy part of this program, but they can't buy all of it.</text>
            <text syncTime="213.071" offset="1003459">Now, the Jaycees have pictured themselves as a private membership organization, and I think it's essential to understand that they really operate the way a business operates.</text>
            <text syncTime="224.442" offset="1048912">For example, their national headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma have a marketing department, a department that's designed to shape and promote the Jaycee image.</text>
            <text syncTime="235.140" offset="1091753">In 1980 this had 40 employees and had a budget of some $2 million.</text>
            <text syncTime="240.873" offset="1114636">In addition to that, they have a membership development department that creates these programs that I referred to you about.</text>
            <text syncTime="248.415" offset="1144833">In the 1980 Annual Report the Jaycees referred to these programs as some among the most useful that they have in getting career opportunities and new jobs.</text>
            <text syncTime="256.928" offset="1178897">Another indication of the business aspect of this community... of this organization... is the way in which the Jaycees recruit.</text>
            <text syncTime="266.236" offset="1216096">For example, in 1980 they had a membership of some 295,000 members; 120 to 130,000 of those members had been recruited the previous year.</text>

            <text syncTime="293.632" offset="1325705">Businesses go out and seek customers.</text>
            <text syncTime="295.944" offset="1335005">They go out on a continuous basis to look for people to buy their products.</text>
            <text syncTime="299.442" offset="1349007">That's precisely what the United States Jaycees does in this case.</text>
            <text syncTime="303.363" offset="1364680">They're continually looking for new people to bring into their organization.</text>

            <text syncTime="310.297" offset="1392370">Fraternities are constantly rushing.</text>
            <text syncTime="312.016" offset="1399266">They want a new pledge group every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="314.109" offset="1407625">Does that make them a business organization?</text>

            <text syncTime="316.779" offset="1418283">No, I don't think it does.</text>
            <text syncTime="318.420" offset="1424866">I think that in a fraternity, for example, Justice Rehnquist, you have a situation in which there are ties that bind the members which are significantly different than the ties that bind the people in the Jaycees.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="329.008" stopTime="338.035">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="329.008" offset="1467184">Well, there may be those differences, but I think one of them is not a... there is not a difference between their desire for new members at frequent intervals.</text>

          <turn speaker="richard_l_varco_jr" startTime="338.035" stopTime="367.211">
            <label>Mr. Richard L. Varco, Jr.</label>
            <text syncTime="338.035" offset="1503338">Well, I bring that point out to show that that's one of the aspects of their business.</text>
            <text syncTime="343.955" offset="1527057">I think some clubs, for example, some private social clubs don't show this rush that fraternities do.</text>
            <text syncTime="348.688" offset="1545970">They're very discreet and private, there's no recruiting that goes on, you have to know somebody to belong.</text>
            <text syncTime="353.608" offset="1565614">So I think that if we're weighing the Jaycees on the spectrum of where they belong, the fact that they go out and seek these people actively shows that they're more like a business and they work more like a business than they do like a private social club.</text>

            <text syncTime="367.211" offset="1620053">Well, an association of this kind has one thing in common with a fraternity that was just mentioned, in that the fraternity has access to these people for about four years of undergraduate work, and perhaps a little longer, and you have an age limit here.</text>

            <text syncTime="3590.313" offset="14512422">Some of the organizations who have filed as amicus here, however, do limit their membership to women, and legitimately so, because those organizations feel that they're promoting the interests of women, and if they want to do that they should limit their organization to women.</text>
            <text syncTime="3604.465" offset="14569056">There are large organizations in this country which do limit their memberships strictly to women for the sole purpose of advancing the interests of women.</text>

            <text syncTime="3613.742" offset="14606149">Mr. Hall, I notice that from Exhibit 3, that the Jaycees in 1981 urged a constitutional amendment requiring Congress to balance the budget every year.</text>
            <text syncTime="3627.611" offset="14661633">And in 1983 they urged a constitutional amendment to support voluntary prayer in American schools.</text>
            <text syncTime="3636.092" offset="14695593">Now, are those fairly typical of the types of things that the Jaycees do?</text>

            <text syncTime="3640.341" offset="14712520">Yes.</text>
            <text syncTime="3640.636" offset="14713774">That's of... typical in terms of the national positions they will take.</text>
            <text syncTime="3646.650" offset="14737807">The local positions by local organizations would be much more tied to local bond issues, to local problems of local and state interest.</text>
            <text syncTime="3655.413" offset="14772811">One further question I'd like to address, and that's the question of vagueness.</text>
            <text syncTime="3663.301" offset="14804367">Presumably, in this case, if the Jaycees have a desire to comply with this statute in any way, the question is how could the bylaws be amended?</text>
            <text syncTime="3677.341" offset="14860582">They meet each and every June, and could amend the bylaws in any way that the membership chose to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="3684.494" offset="14889212">Now, we submit that not only is it impossible for an ordinary individual to know how to amend the bylaws in this case to comply with Minnesota's law so as to be like the Kiwanis, that I submit it would even be literally impossible for the average, ordinary, intelligent lawyer to amend the Jaycees bylaws to comply with it in order to be more a private organization like the Kiwanis, as distinguished from a public organization like the Jaycees.</text>
