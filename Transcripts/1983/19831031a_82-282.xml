            <text syncTime="9.066" offset="175684">Mr. McDonald, I think you may proceed when you are ready.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laughlin McDonald</label>
            <text syncTime="40.408" offset="300967">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="44.769" offset="318417">In 1964, Edgefield County, South Carolina, one of the jurisdictions covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, had an appointed system of local government consisting of two commissioners who were appointed by the governor from the recommendation of the local legislative delegation, and an elected county supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="71.266" offset="424474">The critical date in this litigation is 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="78.983" offset="455299">In that year the appointed commission form of government was abolished and was replaced by a three-member county council elected for the first time at large from residency districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="93.644" offset="513917">Although the 1966 legislation was a voting change subject to preclearance, it was never submitted to the Attorney General nor was it ever the subject of declaratory judgment proceedings in the D.C. courts.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="109.163" stopTime="114.206">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="109.163" offset="575984">Mr. McDonald, what was the nature of the 1966 change that you are describing?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laughlin_mcdonald" startTime="114.206" stopTime="320.240">
            <label>Mr. Laughlin McDonald</label>
            <text syncTime="114.206" offset="596151">The 1966 change instituted a three-member elected, at-large county council with additional home rule powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="124.031" offset="635544">The prior local governing body had been an appointed commission form of government, two commissioners appointed by the governor and then the third member of the commission was a county supervisor.</text>
            <text syncTime="136.951" offset="687162">That voting change in 1966 was never submitted to the Attorney General and as a consequence at-large elections have been used illegally in Edgefield County and have not been evaluated by any person, neither the Attorney General nor the D.C. courts, to determine whether or not they are racially discriminatory and their undeniable consequence has been to exclude blacks totally from membership on the county governing body throughout the use of those unlawful, unprecleared, at-large elections.</text>
            <text syncTime="178.367" offset="852882">Now, despite the failure, admitted failure, of the county to submit to the 1966 Act, the lower court found that preclearance was unnecessary because the Attorney General had, so the court found, in fact, precleared the 1966 Act when he precleared a change in 1971 involving an increase in the size of the council from three to five members and the lower court held alternatively that preclearance of the 1971 increase in size as a matter of law precleared the adoption of at-large voting in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="221.928" offset="1027067">The Appellants in this case, who are black residents of Edgefield County, submit that the local... the lower court erred on both counts.</text>
            <text syncTime="231.652" offset="1065937">First of all, the Attorney General has made it absolutely clear, both in correspondence with state and local officials and also in briefs filed in this case by the Solicitor General, that he was never asked in the 1971 submission involving the increase in size of the council to evaluate or preclear the 1966 adoption of at-large voting.</text>
            <text syncTime="262.593" offset="1189757">The Attorney General has also made it clear that he did not, in fact, evaluate or consider the 1966 change to determine whether or not it had a discriminatory purpose or effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="276.442" offset="1245137">He never treated the 1971 change as one involving the adoption in 1966, of a change from an appointed to an elected at-large local government, and that the 1971 submission was not a submission of the 1966 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="294.734" offset="1318280">The lower court's finding that the Attorney General 1966 change is wholly contradicted by the record and by the representations of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="308.513" offset="1373450">He simply did not evaluate the change made in 1966 and he has not done so to this day and neither has the D.C. courts.</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="320.240" stopTime="356.424">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="320.240" offset="1420366">Mr. McDonald, what if the strictly factual question of did the Attorney General, in fact, evaluate the 1966 change was to be answered the way you said it should, no, he did not.</text>
            <text syncTime="334.402" offset="1477000">But, nonetheless, it was perfectly clear that it had been totally, adequately called to his attention, all of the significant data were before him at the time he was looking at the 1971 change.</text>
            <text syncTime="346.830" offset="1526737">Do you think the simple fact that he did not actually get into the 1966 change was prevented from becoming cleared as a result of the '71 submission?</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="laughlin_mcdonald" startTime="356.424" stopTime="405.117">
            <label>Mr. Laughlin McDonald</label>
            <text syncTime="356.424" offset="1565085">I think if a belated submission had been made and if the jurisdiction had fully complied with the submission requirements that the Court has set out in Allen and the United States versus Board of Commissioners of Sheffield, and if the jurisdiction had made a specific, though late, request that the change could have been cleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="377.498" offset="1649408">But, that was manifestly not done here, because there was no request from the jurisdiction in 1971 that the Attorney General precleared the 1966 change.</text>
            <text syncTime="390.307" offset="1700608">The only request... I think the record is unambiguous on this point... The only request made of the Attorney General was to preclear and increase in size of the council, to preclear the 1971 change and--</text>

            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="405.117" offset="1759854">Well, supposing that the 1971 change, just as you said, and I don't doubt it is, but it makes some reference to what happened in 1966.</text>
            <text syncTime="417.136" offset="1807919">When the Attorney General see that, he says, now, wait a minute, it looks to me like something has happened in 1966 that didn't... hasn't been called to our attention.</text>
            <text syncTime="426.291" offset="1844490">Submit to me as a supplement to your 1971 request for clearance all the data that I will need on the '66 change.</text>

            <label>Mr. Laughlin McDonald</label>
            <text syncTime="439.800" offset="1898616">--Well, if it had been submitted and if it had been considered, then it could have been precleared, but it was not submitted.</text>
            <text syncTime="448.094" offset="1931739">There was never anything ever submitted to the Attorney General which would indicate what the practice was in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="456.549" offset="1965594">There is simply no possible way the Attorney General could have known other than that he was pressured or was able to devine from things that were not before him.</text>
            <text syncTime="466.496" offset="2005405">The lower court concluded that the 1971 preclearance work is a matter of law to preclear the 1966 Act, but with all respect, that could not have been--</text>
          </turn>
          <turn speaker="unknown_speaker" startTime="476.033" stopTime="479.016">
            <label>Unknown Speaker</label>
            <text syncTime="476.033" offset="2043544">It was also concluded as a matter of fact, didn't it?</text>

          <turn speaker="laughlin_mcdonald" startTime="479.016" stopTime="774.239">
            <label>Mr. Laughlin McDonald</label>
            <text syncTime="479.016" offset="2055455">--Which I believe to be patently erroneous on this record.</text>
            <text syncTime="482.218" offset="2068203">But, this Court has made it clear that in order to make a submission the jurisdiction has got to do... It has to do at least two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="493.555" offset="2113552">I has to make a submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="495.636" offset="2121911">And, when Allen talks about making a submission and Sheffield talks about making a submission, I take it to mean that the jurisdiction has got to submit sufficient information to allow the Attorney General to make the kind of comparison which Congress had said he or she must make under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="515.107" offset="2199756">Now, that was manifestly not done here, because there was never submitted through the Attorney General any evidence as to what the practice in Edgefield County was in 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="526.875" offset="2246881">Secondly, not only does the jurisdiction have to make a submission of evidence, but it also has to make a request that a particular change be precleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="536.402" offset="2285019">That, again, was not done here.</text>
            <text syncTime="539.314" offset="2296618">There is absolutely nothing in the record to indicate that the submitting jurisdiction ever requested that the 1966 adoption of at-large elections be precleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="551.651" offset="2345937">The Voting Rights Act itself doesn't prescribe any formal procedures, as you know, for the submission of voting changes, but this Court has been very consistent and quite explicit in Allen and Sheffield and in City of Rome in requiring jurisdictions to make a sufficient request and, secondly, to make a request that a specific change be precleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="583.195" offset="2472161">It seems to me that the critical fact in this case is that neither the Attorney General nor the D.C. courts have ever done, with respect to the 1966 adoption of at-large elections in Edgefield County, what the Congress said and what this Court has said must be done and that is they must be evaluated to determine whether or not they have a discriminatory purpose or effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="620.868" offset="2622835">It has been suggested it is in some sense unfair to the jurisdiction to require it to do so.</text>
            <text syncTime="629.303" offset="2656585">I think nothing could be further off the mark.</text>
            <text syncTime="634.095" offset="2675707">If the change is one that is not discriminatory, then the jurisdiction, if it submits the '66 change, will have it precleared and that will be the end of the Section 5 issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="645.222" offset="2720219">They will be out, if you will, a postage stamp and some time of the county attorney.</text>
            <text syncTime="650.458" offset="2741222">If, however, the change is one that is discriminatory, and I would submit that one cannot read the opinion of the single-judge court, the 1980 opinion deciding the dilution claim in this case, and conclude anything other than that the at-large system has the most aggravated and racially discriminatory impact in Edgefield County.</text>
            <text syncTime="674.093" offset="2835785">If, indeed, the change is one that is discriminatory, I think no one could defend the 17-year non-compliance and non-submission by the local jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="686.021" offset="2883433">The Attorney General in this case did everything, we submit, that he was requested to do by the local jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="704.161" offset="2956053">He was requested to preclear a change involving an increase in the size of the council.</text>
            <text syncTime="710.765" offset="2982384">He did precisely that.</text>
            <text syncTime="712.487" offset="2989281">He did exactly what the Congress envisioned that he would do.</text>
            <text syncTime="717.710" offset="3010179">If there is any failure to comply with the law, it most clearly is the failure of the local jurisdiction to comply with the submission requirements of Section 5 and submit the 1966 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="739.444" offset="3097114">Appellants respectfully ask this Court to do no more than to enforce the provisions of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act and to require Edgefield County to submit promptly the 1964 change to at-large elections so that someone, the Attorney General or the D.C. courts will have an opportunity to evaluate those changes to determine whether or not they have a racially discriminatory purpose or effect.</text>

            <label>Ms. Barbara E. Etkind</label>
            <text syncTime="780.912" offset="3263044">Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="795.181" offset="3320095">It seems to us that a theme underlying both the decision below and Appellees' argument is that the Attorney General should have known that the change to at-large elections was involved in South Carolina's 1971, submission, because that notion presents great potential for eroding Section 5 rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="813.823" offset="3394701">I would like to address it first.</text>
            <text syncTime="815.816" offset="3402642">In the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Congress was concerned not only with eliminating existing forms of voting discrimination, but also with preventing any form of discrimination local jurisdiction might devise in the future.</text>
            <text syncTime="829.174" offset="3456037">The method Congress choose to protect against new forms of discriminations was to require each covered jurisdiction, before implementing any voting change, to submit it for scrutiny by an independent body.</text>
            <text syncTime="842.163" offset="3508073">Congress selected the District Court for the District of Columbia and the Attorney General to conduct this independent scrutiny.</text>
            <text syncTime="849.837" offset="3538688">This right of minority voters to be free from voting changes that have not been found to be nondiscriminatory can only be ensured if the reviewing bodies' attention is, in fact, brought to bear on the precise change in question.</text>
            <text syncTime="863.818" offset="3594695">When preclearance is sought in the District Court, that focus is assured by the requirement that the jurisdiction file a complaint specifying the changes it wishes to have precleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="874.083" offset="3635655">Similarly, this Court has held that when a jurisdiction seeks preclearance by the Attorney General, the statute requires the jurisdiction to state unambiguously the changes it seeks to have approved.</text>
            <text syncTime="886.391" offset="3684974">When a jurisdiction fails to carry that burden, preclearance cannot be based on a determination that the Attorney General should have known that the change required preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="896.867" offset="3726874">Such a result defeats the right afforded by Section 5 which is the right to actual scrutiny of voting changes before they are limited.</text>
            <text syncTime="905.052" offset="3759579">Such a result also inures who the intended beneficiaries of the Voting Rights Act are.</text>
            <text syncTime="910.815" offset="3782672">Section 5 was not intended to benefit the Attorney General or the local jurisdiction, but rather minority voters are the intended beneficiaries of Section 5.</text>
            <text syncTime="920.132" offset="3819870">Accordingly, this is not a contest between Edgefield County and the Attorney General in which the county's failure to make an unambiguous submission can be excused by some purported contributory negligence of the Attorney General.</text>
            <text syncTime="933.683" offset="3874100">For reasons I shall state, we dispute that the Attorney General was negligent in his preclearance of the 1971 submission.</text>
            <text syncTime="940.706" offset="3902208">But, in any event, his role under the statute is not an adversarial one, but more of a judicial one.</text>
            <text syncTime="947.772" offset="3930420">Hence, in the absence of statutory compliance by the jurisdiction, any alleged fault by the Attorney General cannot be attributed to the intended beneficiaries of the Act so as to defeat their rights.</text>
            <text syncTime="960.450" offset="3981202">The requirement that a jurisdiction state unambiguously the changes it wishes to have precleared is entirely consistent with the Section 5 scheme.</text>
            <text syncTime="969.866" offset="4018819">That provision requires the voluntary submission of voting changes by covered jurisdictions and places on them the burden of proving absence of discriminatory purpose or effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="980.735" offset="4062286">This Court has recognized that the Attorney General simply does not have the resources to police all the states and subdivisions covered by the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="987.988" offset="4091335">He receives thousands of Section 5 submissions each year and the statute affords him only 60 days in which to act on them.</text>
            <text syncTime="995.615" offset="4121846">Moreover, as this Court has also emphasized, the Attorney General cannot be charged with knowledge of all the nuances of local law.</text>
            <text syncTime="1002.829" offset="4150685">By contrast, the submitting jurisdiction knows exactly which changes it wants to clear and it is not too much to expect that it state those changes clearly so the Attorney General will be sure to focus on them and, thus, bring to bear the scrutiny that minority voters are entitled to under the Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1021.020" offset="4223410">Here, it cannot be seriously claimed that Appellees or South Carolina ever made an unambiguous request for preclearance of the change to at-large election.</text>
            <text syncTime="1030.487" offset="4261339">The court below found as a fact that South Carolina did not submit the change before it was implemented in 1966 and it is strange credulity to suggest that the 1971 submission was an unambiguous request for approval of the prior change.</text>
            <text syncTime="1047.788" offset="4330512">The only changes brought about by the '71 legislation, as Mr. McDonald said, which would redistrict Edgefield County into five rather than three districts and to increase the number of council members from three to five.</text>
            <text syncTime="1061.065" offset="4383593">The Act was so entitled and South Carolina never indicated there were any other voting changes subject to the preclearance requirement, much less requested preclearance of them.</text>
            <text syncTime="1072.475" offset="4429255">The court below relied on the fact that the 1971 legislation contained a provision for at-large elections, but the Attorney General knew from the face of the '66 statute that the at-large provision was not new in '71.</text>
            <text syncTime="1088.525" offset="4493516">Appellees contend that the Attorney General also should have known from the face of the 1966 statute that the at-large provision was first enacted in that year and, thus, was a change requiring preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="1102.983" offset="4551299">But, the Attorney General did not know from the 1966 statute that its provision for at-large elections was not a mere codification of prior law as was the identical 1971 provision and, in any event, what the Attorney General perhaps should have known or should have inquired into is irrelevant.</text>
            <text syncTime="1123.978" offset="4635308">The right guaranteed minority voters under Section 5 is actual scrutiny of voting changes before they are put into effect.</text>
            <text syncTime="1131.662" offset="4666028">Of course, if the Attorney General, in fact, had considered a particular change, regardless of whether he had been unambiguously requested to do so, Section 5 interests would have been protected, but that is not what happened here.</text>
            <text syncTime="1145.401" offset="4720990">The only information the Attorney General had in 1971 were in the difference between the 1966 and the 1971 legislation.</text>
            <text syncTime="1154.768" offset="4758397">In order to have evaluated the initial change from a combined appointed, elected council to a council entirely elected at large, he would have needed the pre-1966 information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1166.737" offset="4806358">Accordingly, if the Attorney General considered the at-large feature at all, he did so only in the context of comparing an at-large, three-member council with an at-large, five-member council.</text>

            <text syncTime="1325.109" offset="5439775">Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court:</text>
            <text syncTime="1334.536" offset="5477496">The single issue before the Court this afternoon is whether or not Edgefield County, South Carolina, with respect to its county council, is in compliance with Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1346.136" offset="5523890">This is not a Section 2 issue and this is not a constitutional issue.</text>
            <text syncTime="1350.668" offset="5542071">This is whether or not Section 5 has been complied with.</text>
            <text syncTime="1354.091" offset="5555759">And, with respect to that issue, we have three points which we would like to address.</text>
            <text syncTime="1358.462" offset="5573209">Number one, the 1971 Act prescribed the current method of electing the Edgefield County council today.</text>
            <text syncTime="1366.218" offset="5604242">There has been no change since 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="1369.500" offset="5617408">Number two, the '71 Act was precleared in its entirety; that is all of its provisions, the five-member council, the five residency districts, the at-large method and the two year term were all contained in the '71 Act and they were all precleared in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="1388.832" offset="5694730">And, number three, the home rule changes, if they are Section 5 changes at all, were precleared on August 28, 1975 when the Attorney General precleared the Home Rule Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1403.161" offset="5751991">Now, the lower court found as a fact that the preclearance of the 1971 Act precleared that Act in its entirety and we submit that that finding is not only clearly erroneous as it must be to be reversed, but it is immanently correct that there was in fact and by operation of law a preclearance of the '71 Act in its entirety.</text>
            <text syncTime="1429.389" offset="5856899">The '71 Act begins by striking out all of the election provisions of the 1966 Act and that is important, we think, because the '71 Act specifically says the section of the '66 Act which relates to method of election is hereby... is amended by striking it out and placing it with the following.</text>
            <text syncTime="1454.085" offset="5955746">It replaces the '66 Act with provisions which add two members so that they now have a five-member county council.</text>
            <text syncTime="1461.829" offset="5986675">It changes all of the residency districts.</text>
            <text syncTime="1464.471" offset="5997228">There had been three.</text>
            <text syncTime="1465.823" offset="6002662">It adds two and changes the composition of all five.</text>
            <text syncTime="1469.506" offset="6017395">It provides once again for an at-large method of elections and for two-year terms.</text>
            <text syncTime="1476.389" offset="6044980">It was submitted along with 17 other pieces of legislation and the submission says simply this:</text>
            <text syncTime="1484.786" offset="6078522">"That in accordance with provisions of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, there are submitted herewith copies of the following Acts. "</text>

            <text syncTime="1503.329" offset="6152709">The next act that took place was that the Attorney General wrote to Edgefield County and said that he needed additional information.</text>
            <text syncTime="1512.543" offset="6189594">He needed boundary maps, he needed voter registration statistics, he needed population statistics, and he also needed the election provisions now in force.</text>
            <text syncTime="1523.459" offset="6233166">That requested was acted upon and he received all that he asked for including a copy of the 1966 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1532.616" offset="6269842">His next action was not to ask what was in effect on November 1, 1964 or was 1966 precleared, but his next act was to preclear the 1971 Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="1547.886" offset="6330969">And, his preclearance letter says simply,</text>
            <text syncTime="1551.429" offset="6345075">"the Attorney General does not interpose any objection to the change in question. "</text>
            <text syncTime="1558.064" offset="6371615">That is the enactment itself at No. 521 of 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="1563.787" offset="6394499">In other words, as this letter manifests, he precleared all of the provisions of the 1971 Act.</text>

            <text syncTime="2017.904" offset="8210949">And, we think when he had the '66 statute in front of him, he either saw that it had been precleared, which the record says that he did not do, that it had not been precleared, and there is no record to show that it had been, or he saw that it had been completely superseded by the '71 Act and proceeded to compare all features of the '71 act with November 1, 1964.</text>
            <text syncTime="2043.350" offset="8312722">That was his first opportunity.</text>
            <text syncTime="2045.092" offset="8319723">Then in 1979, when he objected to the home rule ordinance and resolution which merely continues this '71 method of election, he began his objection letter by saying ostensibly this is the same system of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2062.466" offset="8389209">Now, that wouldn't have been relevant if he hadn't assumed that the same system of election had been precleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2069.267" offset="8416481">"There is to be no dragging out of this extraordinary federal remedy. "</text>
            <text syncTime="2072.850" offset="8430796">And, as the Court in US v. Georgia found an 11-year delay as inexcusable, we think that this late attempt, 12 years after preclearance has been obtained, is also inexcusable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2087.100" offset="8487743">Now, the case should stop here because we have a '71 preclearance, we have a stipulated fact that the method of election has remained the same since 1971, and we have cases and the Attorney General's own regulations saying that a failure to object for any reason is not reviewable.</text>
            <text syncTime="2109.245" offset="8576350">And, the case, as I say, should stop there.</text>
            <text syncTime="2111.646" offset="8585963">However, the Plaintiffs' second issue is that the Home Rule Act effected changes which require a submission of Edgefield County's ordinance and resolution, which, as I mentioned, continue unchanged the '71 method of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2127.969" offset="8651269">The only change effected by the Home Rule Act is in power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2131.640" offset="8665898">It expanded the powers of all South Carolina counties.</text>
            <text syncTime="2136.394" offset="8684915">The Plaintiffs again stipulate that the Home Rule Act has only changed the powers; that is that the method of election has remained unchanged by the Home Rule Act.</text>
            <text syncTime="2147.551" offset="8729532">And, the Attorney General really, in his letter of objection, appears to agree with it, because again he says ostensibly this is the same system of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2157.577" offset="8769656">In other words, the Home Rule Act has not changed the method of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2161.108" offset="8783762">Edgefield County assumed these new powers, these expanded powers, as of July 1, 1976, and it assumed the powers pursuant to the Home Rule Act, which was precleared in August of '75 and the lower court so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2178.660" offset="8853979">The lower court relied on a decision from our local three-judge court concerning Charleston County which was in the exact same situation.</text>
            <text syncTime="2189.248" offset="8896402">It had a pre-home rule method of election which had been precleared and it continued that under home rule and the decision, Woods versus Hamilton, held that if a South Carolina county kept its method of election unchanged by home rule, then it would not need to submit its implementing ordinance which merely readopts that method of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2212.453" offset="8989189">The Attorney General was a party to that law suit and that decision was not appealed.</text>
            <text syncTime="2217.175" offset="9008102">And, even as recently as this year, the Attorney General took the same position in the case that is now pending in the D.C. District Court involving Sumter County in which the defendant Attorney General urged the court to find that the preclearance of the Home Rule Act precleared only the right provisions which were the holding of the referenda and the expansion of the powers.</text>
            <text syncTime="2242.193" offset="9108099">The ordinance and the resolution itself, and they are found in the Joint Appendix beginning at 183, do not mention powers and they do not change the method of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2254.180" offset="9156059">They simply continue the method of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2256.932" offset="9167135">Again, the lower court so held.</text>
            <text syncTime="2259.644" offset="9178002">Significantly, we think the Attorney General's objection letter notes its rather uncertain jurisdiction.</text>
            <text syncTime="2267.829" offset="9210708">First, by beginning and saying ostensibly this is the same system of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2273.261" offset="9232442">It later says that while the formal structure has remained the same, it then characterizes its home rule preclearance as being beyond recall and if the Home Rule Act had been something other than what was represented to us we might not have precleared it.</text>
            <text syncTime="2290.913" offset="9303077">It is a very uncertain type of objection letter.</text>
            <text syncTime="2294.997" offset="9319377">But, nevertheless, Edgefield County did make a good faith attempt to comply with it and as the record reflects it set up public hearings, it established a committee to draft single-member districts, and then the Woods versus Hamilton decision came, which said if you are a South Carolina county and make no change in your method of election, you don't need to submit your ordinance and resolution, and, again, the Attorney General did not appeal that.</text>
            <text syncTime="2322.095" offset="9427733">We would urge the Court to affirm, of course, on both of the issues, but particularly with respect to the second issue; that is that the home rule changes, if they were changes under Section 5, have been precleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2337.024" offset="9487501">Consider the effect of the implicit holding of the lower court which is that they were, in fact, Section 5 changes or otherwise they wouldn't have had to be precleared.</text>
            <text syncTime="2349.113" offset="9535775">We think that before the Court expands the Voting Rights Act into a non-election law; that is simply an expansion of powers, that it should consider the language of the Act itself, its own previous decisions, and particularly the City of Lockhart decision where just recently the Court said it had the entire election system in front of it and could determine the pre-existing... the constitutionality of the pre-existing elements as well as the changes, but never once talked about the fact that it went from a general law city to a home rule city; that is a change in power.</text>
            <text syncTime="2386.136" offset="9683942">Accordingly, despite the second non-issue that we think the Plaintiffs have raised with respect to the Home Rule Act, we end with the identical issue that we began with; that is the 1971 Act prescribes a current method of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2404.659" offset="9758025">It was precleared in its entirety in 1971.</text>
            <text syncTime="2409.111" offset="9775788">To reverse the lower court, we think, would signal at least two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2413.465" offset="9793238">First of all, that the sufficiency of a submission is always subject to challenge, even 12 years after preclearance was obtained and despite the 60-day language in the Act, and we think the second thing it would signal is non-election changes; that is something like the expansion of powers is subject to preclearance.</text>
            <text syncTime="2433.197" offset="9872128">But, if the Court affirms, on the other hand, it would signal at least two things.</text>
            <text syncTime="2438.709" offset="9894175">First, that once a covered jurisdiction complies with the Voting Rights Act, that the integrity of its state and local legislation will remain undisturbed; and, second, that the preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act are to be limited to their intended scope.</text>
            <text syncTime="2457.152" offset="9967945">And, all of this is not to leave the Plaintiffs without a remedy, because pending in this very lawsuit is a Section 2 issue, a constitutional issue, and a 1983 issue, which, of course, go to the merits of the present method of election.</text>
            <text syncTime="2473.952" offset="10035132">The Plaintiffs also have, under our state law, a political remedy, because our Home Rule Act now allows ten percent of the registered voters of any county to petition for a referendum to change to the single-member district.</text>
